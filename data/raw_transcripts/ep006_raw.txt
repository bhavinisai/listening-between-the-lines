[Music]
Wow, that looks very dead.
[Music]
and the background. You had a good you
had a good day here.
>> It's hot though, right?
>> It's typical
>> SF weather.
>> Ah,
>> yesterday was super super cold. I
haven't been outside so I didn't know it
was hot today.
>> You live here?
>> No, New York now.
>> Oh,
>> I moved to New York recently sadly. I
like it here more. But
>> really
>> parents are in New York. So, I wanted to
They're getting older.
>> New York seems like a lot more fun.
>> The city is more fun,
>> but I SF is beautiful.
[Music]
>> Where are you based?
>> Based out of India.
>> Okay. Where? I live between Bangalore,
Mumbai and Goa in India.
>> Okay.
>> Have you been recently?
>> Uh I go once a year. I don't remember. I
I was there earlier this year. Yeah. But
>> like it
>> at least.
>> Yeah. It's so like it's just the energy
is incredible and the teams you know we
got and I think it's Hyderabad and
Bangalore. We got teams there and
>> it's just a like a group who is super
excited. The energy you get out of the
teams when you go visit them is it's
pretty awesome. I like it a lot.
>> What's happening in India D with I know
your main competition is Ola who's also
a really good friend of mine.
>> Yes.
>> We live in the same city.
>> Yes. Well, have we officially started?
>> Yeah.
>> All right. Good. Okay. Um
Ola used to be our main competition.
>> Mhm. Uh and
you know we were always going
head-to-head with Ola in terms of the
category position in the marketplace.
They were the local competitor. I think
we had the better global tech etc. But
they were always scrappy.
>> Um I think
he got uh somewhat distracted by other
interesting areas uh for him. So I say
now the the the tougher competition in
India is
>> Rapido.
>> You know they're the upstart.
>> They got into two wheelers and
three-wheelers really aggressively super
simple model just kind of this
subscription zero commission model very
scrappy as well and they have gained a
good amount of category position. I
think Ola is now kind of a distant
third. Mhm.
>> They're trying to get into four-wheelers
now. So we when we talk about India,
other than the talent that we have there
and building there and really building
out our talent base, but when we when we
talk about the business in India and
it's the third largest country in terms
of mobility trips, so India is really
important to us, the competition that we
talk about is really rapid. And
>> what do you think Rapido is getting
right that the others are not? Um you
I'm not on the ground but I think Rapido
uh built a really simple model which is
basically you know the subscription
model you pay a certain amount and for
the rest of the day you operate on
what's essentially zero commission
>> right
>> uh and once you pay the subscription
then because Rapido's essentially taking
a zero commission
>> Mhm. then the the driver pay is higher
than a player than a player who like us
who's taking a commission on every trip.
So I think that was a smart way for them
to break into the marketplace. Rapido is
not making money. So the real test of
the business isn't how fast you can grow
if you're spending. Um it's actually how
fast you can grow while you're
profitable. And I think Rapido is a long
way away from that. But they've been
innovative. They've been scrappy. They
move fast. Um, it's a it's a they're
they're building their brand there in
the local market. So, we've got a lot of
respect for them. Uh, and you know, we
intend to compete really hard with them.
>> Nice. So, Dra, this podcast that we do
is largely focused around
young wannabe entrepreneurs in India.
>> Mhm. and the spaces that you operate in
uh be it mobility delivery
uh may I also say autonomous vehicles
electric vehicles
>> these are
taking up significant mind share in the
dialogue that's happening back home
>> uh so at the end of today if I can
arrive at some takeaways that one could
use in India to build around any of
these sectors will be incredible But
maybe we start with you the individual
and you give us a few minutes on where
you began and how you arrived to where
you are today.
>> Yeah, absolutely. So I was uh born in
Iran.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh and
during when I was born in Iran, the
shaver was really trying to modernize
Iran very quickly. And I was part I was
very lucky to be a part of a family that
>> was part of the industrialization of of
Iran. There's a
our family ran a group Albor's group and
then within it manufacturing companies
like Tli Daru which uh were
manufacturing we licensed
pharmaceuticals from the west and then
manufacture them in Iran and then
distribute them in Iran and the and the
Middle East. It was a big business. We
were very well-known family. My my
father was in charge of building out all
the factories and our family was raised
with assumption that we would then step
into the family business and and and
keep growing and it was a really
exciting time. Can
>> I digress and ask a question?
>> Whenever I read about Iran's history,
>> when I talk to the young folk, the shast
time seems to have been this great time.
What happened? Why did it change? Why
did the regime change? Well, I think it
was a great time for uh people who were
lucky enough to participate in the
modernization of Iran. The fact
>> was it like crony capitalism?
>> I don't I don't know enough, but I think
that to some extent in hindsight, in
hindsight's 2020, I think that Shaw
tried to monize too quickly.
>> Mhm.
>> I think that he was too focused on
building out military power. So in terms
of the growth of GDP in Iran, a
significant amount went to establishing
Iran as the power center of the Middle
East or the military power center of the
Middle East versus the industrial power
center of the Middle East. Uh and I
think he didn't bring along the
outskirts, the people who lived in
smaller cities, etc. Mhm.
>> And part of his modernization
left Islam behind. Uh and Iran as a
culture is much more ancient than Islam.
>> Mhm.
>> But Islam is part of the society as
well. And so his moving too fast, his
focusing on military power versus his
people, his focus on kind of the big
cities versus everybody.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh, you know, rhymes with maybe things
that have happened here, uh, created a
movement and an opportunity for the
Islamic regime to come in.
>> So people tend to romanticize the past.
Now, do I think that the time under the
sha was a better time? Absolutely. I
think what's happened with the Islamic
regime
um you know there's a regime that isn't
uh I think doing the Iranian people
right
>> uh and cares about things other than the
um the benefit of the people there and I
and I think that's it's disappointing um
and it's been there for
too long in my opinion but you know
every time has good and it's bad and
unfortunately
the sha wasn't able to follow through on
a movement that had a lot of promise and
I think the the biggest promise in my
estimation was was the value of
education uh and women went to college
etc. The number of women graduates in
Iran actually is higher than than the
number of men graduates. So there were a
lot of seeds planted there that had a
lot of promise and hopefully hopefully
Iran can get out of I think now its
obsession with Islam and think more
about its people uh and building out for
the good of the people in concert with
Islam but not subjugated to Islam. Does
it get in the way in any way today? The
fact that your origins are there while
the countries where you live today and
that might be in conflict.
>> Not not a conflict in my life. Um, you
know, there's a sadness and leaving your
home country. I mean, my country is now
the United States and we got to rebuild
in the US and I'm so thankful for it.
But would I love to go back? I would. uh
but to some extent the the culture of
Iran matches the western culture. It's a
group of people who want to build. It's
a group of people who value education,
who are ambitious.
Um so I don't find it a conflict with
who I am now. But there's a part of me
that I feel is incomplete and will be
incomplete if I never am able to go back
to Iran.
>> I have Iranian friends who live in India
now.
>> Yes. And most of them mimic your emotion
in thinking that here's a land that had
so much opportunity.
>> Incredible.
>> But
just religion seems to have caused so
much harm than good in that particular
geography.
>> And and it doesn't have to. There there
are many things about religion that are
beautiful. But
>> um again, I think what's happened in
Iran is uh it's really unfair to the
people there. Are you religious, Dar?
>> I'm not religious. I'd say I'm
spiritual, right?
>> Uh but I'm not religious. I, you know, I
I I believe in the power of humanity.
And I think religion
uh is
plays to what makes us human and the
relationships between us and the deep
deep good in all of us
>> and uh I think it's it's beautiful. you
know, religions, the stories,
>> uh, the beliefs are are beautiful. And
so I describe myself more as spiritual,
but for me, my belief is in the good of
humanity.
>> At the very core, do you think that is
what religion is? Stories, great
stories.
>> I think yeah. Um, you know, if you if if
you kind of go through the there's an
intellectual exercise I I heard which is
if if all of our memory was wiped out
>> Yeah.
>> and you rebuilt religions on Earth,
there's a high probability that the
nature of those religions and the
stories would be different. If you
rebuilt science, the science will come
out the same.
And so I do think that there are deep
truths there are deep human truths to uh
to religion and those deep truths are
unchanging
but each religion are definitely
different ways of getting to those
similar deep truths.
>> What is spirituality to you? A lot of
people ask me if I'm spiritual and
>> I'm like what is it? I'm trying to
figure out what the word even means to
begin with. I think it's a great
question. Uh for me, what spirituality
means to me is a belief in the goodness
of humanity, a belief in, you know, you
and I
>> have
so little in common in terms of where we
came from
>> and maybe our uh stories, but so much in
common. We've sat together in five
minutes and there's a connection there.
>> Mhm. Uh, and I don't think that
connection is because of a logical
construct that I'm here to speak to you
on a podcast that are, you know, like
I'm not faking it.
>> Mhm.
>> Right. There's a connection that we're
establishing now having this discussion.
That to me is a spiritual connection.
It's not a logical construct. You know,
you're not being nice to me because you
think you have to be and vice versa.
>> Um, instantly you have that rapport. And
sometimes, by the way, you don't with
some certain people.
>> That comes from a spiritual side.
>> And that spirit can be uh captured for
good
>> and it can be captured for evil as well.
>> So, in a way, we're all connected
somehow like trees and roots.
>> Uh, you know, literally, I don't know,
but yes, I do think there's a deeper
connection
>> um within humanity. And listen, there's
there are some people who attribute that
to perfectly logical causes, right? the
love that you have. Do you have family?
Do you have brothers and sisters?
>> Yeah.
>> You know, there are certain people who
would say that your um what do you have?
>> Brother.
>> Yeah. Your love for your brother is
based on the genetic similarity of you
two.
>> So, it's actually while you may
ascertain that to a deep love that you
have for family, it's actually purely
logically based on your existence as a
bunch of genes who wants to continue
those genes. and your brother has a
genetic makeup that's quite similar to
you. So what you view as familial love
is actually adaptation that is feeding
you that familial love. There is a
logical explanation to all this. I kind
of choose to acknowledge that
>> but I view that the outcome of that is
spirituality. Now it may be based on
genetic logic between all of us but I
think that outcome is um beautiful and
I'd rather keep it at the spiritual
level versus say oh it's all it's just
us being um gene machines that are
trying to uh continue our genes
indefinitely
>> would make a case for liking people who
are genetically similar to us as well
>> because we similar genes
>> appropriate. Yeah, absolutely. I I feel
a connection to Iran, a deep connection
to Iran. Why?
>> Um I came here when I was 9 years old.
We're now back at history, right?
>> Uh and I
>> I have to say one thing. Uh I was in
your old office yesterday.
>> Yes.
>> And Alan and Co. I was meeting
>> somebody for something
>> and you know Bob Kerry.
>> Uh yes, I've met him. I don't know Bob
very well, but I've met him.
>> Yeah. So they were telling me you should
ask D. And I said I'm meeting you the
next day.
And they were telling me you should ask
DH when he used to be here. He used to
say he doesn't believe in globalization.
Is that because genes away from one
geography become too far. Boy, that was
Bob's takeaway from
I don't even remember that. I don't if I
was trying to like upset him or
something like that. I don't believe in
globalization.
I don't know what that means or I don't
know what I meant at the time. But I do
think that, you know, again, you could
the that that connection I have with
Iran, I believe is a spiritual
connection. I don't know where it comes
from
>> because I'm so American, right? I've
I've lived uh the vast majority of my
life um as an American. I've been
incredibly lucky to be here, but there's
a part of me that feels empty
if I don't go back. Uh and you know
that's probably a spiritual connection.
Again you could put a genetic underlying
cause to it but I like the story of that
being spirituality more.
>> I get that. I think I feel that in India
strongly.
>> Yeah.
>> So nine year nine you move here.
>> Yeah. So we had uh the Iranian the
revolution happened the Islamic
revolution happened.
um little story which is uh we we were
intending to stay at one point but then
I think the the house across the street
from us was related to the Shawam house.
So some revolutionary guards jumped
wanted to go attack that house and they
jumped over went through our uh garden
um I think their guns went off so shots
went off so bullets came through our
house and at that point my mom said
we're getting out of here.
>> Wow. Uh, so we went to the south of
France. We were a wealthy family. We had
a place there. And really the intent was
to go to to the south of France until
things calmed down.
>> Mhm.
>> Well, things never calmed down.
>> Uh, we happened to have an uncle who's
still alive now. He's 101 years old.
Uncle Nasola who uh lived in the US. He
married a Faith um a uh an American
woman, wonderful, wonderful uh auntie.
And so we came to the US to stay with
them. And then we knew we could never go
back.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh and we started a life here. So I've
been in the US ever since I was 9 years
old.
>> Iranians are quite wealthy. Whenever I
go to I realize this when I go to
Beverly Hills and everybody's Iranian.
Why is that?
>> Well, I think the Iranians who were
wealthy got to go got to leave.
Uh and you know Iranians there were
pretty entrepreneurial culture and a lot
of Iranians invested in real estate. You
know we came here in the uh late 1970s '
80s and it was a good time to come to
America and establish yourself and get
into business in the US. Uh and my
family did the same. My family did the
same. But the it it was really for the
kids. I was only 9 years old. I I think
children are able to adjust to change
much more readily.
>> You know, for us, like America was this
magic uh country where I went from like
three channels in Iran to 35 channels
cable.
>> I couldn't understand the language very
well. But we adjusted really well and
and we always had our family around us.
>> But it was much harder for my parents.
You know, my my father his whole life
was business
>> and he he took a shot at some
entrepreneurial businesses. they didn't
work out very well and without work he
kind of um didn't have a a cause in his
life. Um he went back to Iran cuz his
father was dying. So I didn't see him I
think between the ages of 13 and 19 cuz
they wouldn't let him out of the country
for those six years. Um and my mom who
lived a life of absolute luxury had to
go back to work. She worked as a
salesperson.
uh at Nordstrom Seline and you know it
it was a very very difficult adjustment
for them but for the kids we always had
family we got to go to private school
and we got to have the kind of education
that then afforded us the opportunities
that we've taken advantage of of since
>> so you started school here where in
America
>> uh in Westchester County New York about
uh an hour of New York at a wonderful
school called Hackley School
>> and then I went to uh Brown university
and studied engineering at Brown
University. Uh, and then I was going to
an engineering management program and I
met a commodity trader, a woman in New
York City who I completely fell in love
with and I had to find a job in New York
City and the only jobs available in New
York City were investment banking jobs
and so that's how I got to Allen and
Company that you just talked about
>> and I worked at Allen and Company for I
think it was like eight years or so.
>> Mhm. Um, and one of my clients there was
a gentleman named Barry Diller.
>> Uh, who was this legendary um, uh,
figure in media and and then, uh, very
much in within the internet and I he was
a client of mine and I remember like my
intention was to stay at Allen & Company
forever. It is a great familyrun
business. uh really look out for your
clients. You know, it's not the kind of
investment bank that's looking for fees.
They want to help you build a business.
So, I thought I was going to be there
forever, but then I saw Barry. I say, if
if I ever get a chance to work for that
guy
>> Mhm.
>> I'll take it in a second.
>> Why was that? Why was Barry Was Barry
interesting or Expedia interesting?
>> Um this was before Expedia. It It was
all Barry. he was um
every time he came into a room, the
whole room would light up.
>> Uh it just the the energy that he
carried with him was extraordinary. And
I'll tell you a little story of of when
we met. Um, and it's a lesson that I
learned in in in business was that he uh
he was bidding for uh he he was running
a company called QVC, which was home
shopping,
>> bidding for Paramount, which was the uh
the company that he he used to run. So,
it's like his coming home.
>> Uh, and I was the little crappy analyst
who was running his his deal model.
>> And at one point, you know, the the
numbers started getting really high.
He's like, "I want to meet the person
who built this deal model." And you
know, usually with these investment
banks, you like have a managing director
and a vice president and an associate.
And he's like, "No, I want to meet the
person. I want this person to take me
through the model." And so, he comes in
and I'm like so nervous. I'm about to
like die. And he forced me to like take
him through every single line of this
model so he could understand what he was
doing. And the lesson that I learned
from him was that every time you you
know the the higher up you get an
organization and it's something that I
really think about now the more
procured
uh your version of what's happening in
the real world becomes. You have a chief
of staff who controls your
>> uh your schedule the the and so all the
information flow to you becomes
controlled.
>> Mhm. And as the information flow comes
up to you, it gets edited and edited and
edited
>> and all the edges
leave
>> and you essentially get access to the
information that the organization wants
you to have. And the biggest mistakes
that I see with businesses is not
usually errors of judgment, but you just
didn't really know what was going on in
the organization. And Barry went right
to kind of the source. He didn't want
the editing. He didn't want the smooth
presentation this or that. And so he
wanted to get it to the source. You
know, I did okay because then he hired
me as his banker. And I just fell in
love with
>> to everyone now like what happens to
CEOs because of the management teams and
so on and so forth. to normal people. Is
everybody by virtue of using large
language models today getting a version
that
if they did it manually they would have
they would have discovered that there
are other versions possible.
>> Definitely.
>> Is it making us all stupid? I mean
listen it it's it it's it's not making
all of us stupid but if you are lazy
enough to just depend on that version of
reality
>> because it's a very easy version of
reality available to you then you could
possibly be stupid. And so that's a a
sometimes
as in organizations, you know, the
organization
takes over the flow of information
>> up the the organization, etc. And one
lesson that I learned from Barry is like
the way you fight that is to create
these random matches, etc. to fight the
organization's
um need to package everything for you
because it's the things that you don't
know that ultimately, you know, hit you
on the side of the head that make you
vulnerable. Um and so it's a it's a very
long-winded story, but uh eventually
Barry lost that deal. He then started um
with in partnership with John Malone
who's another kind of legend in the
entertainment industry uh home shopping
network and started rolling up some
other uh assets. And at that point he he
did a big deal with USA Networks. He
didn't have any staff to help him out.
And at that point he hired me to be his
deal person and I followed him. So then
we kind of took the he he was really
Barry was really interested in the
intersection of entertainment with
interactivity. Um and this is like
during the AOL days etc. Uh and
>> and we actually got lucky because we
bought a company called Ticket Master.
Um I don't know if Ticket Master
operates in India but like you know they
they would sell but I remember it.
>> Yeah. And in the olden days, the way
that Ticket Master would sell tickets
was either you would go to like a Tower
Record store and like wait in line for
the Madonna concert or you would call
Ticket Master kind of call call to to
get these tickets. And they did a deal
with America Online. And
whoosh,
>> the volumes went online.
>> And so at that point, Dyer and I were
like, "Okay, what else looks like
tickets? It's a virtual good, advanced
ticketing, reserve seats. What else
looks or rhymes with transactions
happening either over the phone or, you
know, across a desk? Um, and because the
transactions are virtual, you don't have
shipping costs, etc. We didn't want to
compete with Jeff Bezos. Let's it go
after those companies that are offline
because we know all the stuff is going
to move online. So, that led us to, for
example, travel. You know, in the olden
days, you would go to the travel agency
or you would call a travel agent to book
travel like that's going to go online.
>> So, we started buying businesses that
were either offline that were moving
online or some of the early online
travel companies like Expedia. Uh we
went into the personals business,
mass.com. In the olden days, you would
call and be like, "Hi, I'm Da and I'm
>> I'm 5'9. I'm 6'2 and this and that." you
know, like you leave your profile online
and someone else would pick that
profile. All this stuff went online. So,
it was a really wonderful adventure of
finding businesses that we thought would
take advantage of this movement of um of
uh offline to online. Travel was a huge
category that we invested in. I went
from being Barry's deal person to being
his chief financial officer. And then at
one point the travel business
um it had this incredible growth but it
hit some turbulence and at that point uh
uh Barry needed a CEO and I was dumb
enough to raise my hand. I said hey
maybe I can run this thing and that's
when I took over what became uh Expedia
and I ran Expedia for 13 years. Barry
was always a chairman. I was the CEO of
the company and it was a great run. We
had a great run together. How does
travel change next? D I think it's a
industry which has stagnated a bit in
terms of
>> how one books. At least my experience
online of booking a ticket, a hotel
>> hasn't changed that much in the last few
years.
>> Yeah, I I don't think that the travel
industry's innovated that much. I I
think you're exactly right and it
frustrates me,
>> you know, which is like what it the
booking experience looks quite similar.
I think one obvious answer is the Gent
experience which is can you actually get
AI agents or um uh LM agents to book the
travel for you to to go to the various
sites and compare
>> uh compare uh prices etc and and book
for you. So, I think that part of the
travel booking experience can be easier
having agents work for you. I think that
the discovery part of the travel
experience can get much much better.
This is I think one area where LM today
shine because if you thought in the
again probably 10 years ago
>> I want to go someplace over the summer
how you would figure out where to go it
would be you would maybe read a magazine
or go online or talk to friends or you
heard about something the way to gather
information or go to Google which I
think could be quite frustrating you
know luxury vacation in Europe like the
the results you get are trash in my
opinion.
um with LLMs now actually their ability
to gather the information and bring you
unexpected results etc. I think travel
discovery is going to get much much
better and is much better today.
>> Mhm.
>> Um travel booking I think agents can
help you as well. And then I think one
area that I think Uber is really good at
that I think the experience can improve
significantly is your inmarket
experience. You know why is it that when
you land and you take the Uber to the to
your hotel you even need to check in
right we should we have your phone we
know where you are. come into the room,
you know, you're why can't it be you're
in room uh, you know, 30 31E and just go
up there? You already checked in and go
in, you know, why do I need to sit there
and, you know, have the perfectly nice
person ask me if I had a nice flight
>> and, you know, here's my room, etc. I
think the in market experience is
something that hasn't been innovated on
at all and it's something that could
improve as well. Yeah, I'm able to today
discover, say I'm coming to San
Francisco.
>> Yes.
>> And I want to figure out which hotel
suits my needs. I can enter my taste
each time and the agent will recommend
something. But is there one place where
I don't have to think and agent can do
everything? I don't think there's one
solve for it today.
>> No. And and
there definitely isn't one place today.
I I do think
the cost of a bad decision in travel is
very high.
>> Yeah.
>> So I don't think you're going to get to
a place and I'm certainly not going to
get to a place where I tell an agent to
find me a hotel in San Francisco and
just book it and then you know on the
day when I arrive there I'm like where
am I going?
>> Yeah. Um, but I think agents can do a
great job of of reducing, you know, that
list that on Expedia, you look at the 50
hotels and then you're filtering for,
you know, maybe where you're looking or
the class of hotels. Um, it it can
collate, it can give you the three
hotels that you're most likely to like
based on your historical experiences. So
I think there's this in between space
and I think agents can do a great job in
that in between space but I think that
final decision at least for me is going
to be up to you. But that coalation that
kind of bringing everything together
that's a that could be of very very high
utility. If you had an idea to build
something around travel,
>> Mhm.
>> sitting on the board of Expedia and
running Uber at the same time, where do
you build what?
Um,
I think I would build I I would not go
after the I
>> would not go after the inspiration side
because I think the inspiration side,
thank you very much, is is going to be
served really really well by an open AI
or a Google. They're collecting all the
information. and they're going to have
lots of context about who you and I are
>> and and the way people get inspired,
it's so um disperse,
>> right,
>> that it's going to be very difficult for
you to build one service that let's say
services 70% of your inspiration.
>> And and I really do think that Google,
OpenAI, other LLMs are are going to just
get better and better here. But I think
the agentic
search booking experience and then
inmarket experience to make it a very
smooth handoff from one experience to
the other. I think that's something that
I would focus on, you know, with my
Expedia and Uber hat on at the same
time.
>> Something interesting to build though. I
think a lot of opportunity here. It's
not solved for at all.
>> Someone's going to get it right. And I I
do think one challenge in terms of how
the industry is constructed right now is
that the OTAAS, the Booking.coms, the
Expedias of the world, they have they
are very self-interested in making sure
that you book within their um their
supply base.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh and at the same time outside of that
supply base, you know, they're
organizing a ton of content, prices,
etc. features and information. So
there's utility in that. Mhm.
>> The ultimate solution is going to be an
agent that can sit above it all and can
kind of scour the internet and scour all
the booking services and then surface
the results which may be a mix and match
of all of them for you based on your
tastes. So I don't know actually and I
hope it's Expedia because I'm on the
board and I love the company. I hope
it'll be Expedia who puts it all
together. Mhm.
>> But there could be kind of an umbrella
agent who is truly representing your
interest versus Expedia's interest. Now,
if Expedia does a great job, they will
maybe expand or they will, you know,
over a period of time amalgamate all the
content on the on the web. So, all the
travel content on the web, booking
content on the web. So, that super agent
doesn't add much value.
>> When you have an umbrella agent, soon
you'll have another and then another.
>> Yeah.
So will it come down to who is able to
extrapolate your taste and can someone's
taste be deciphered from past data. You
think I
>> I think it's going to be a combination
of past data. Um I think that you want
an you want an agent that will do some
exploration for you,
>> you know. So, for example, when um we
are showing you the restaurants that
you're likely to want to pick on Uber
Eats, if all we show you is the mo is
the ones that you're most likely to or
based on what you've done in the past,
then we're missing that surprise. We're
missing that explore. So, you want an
agent that's a combination of explore
and exploit.
>> Mhm. Um, I think that's going to be so I
don't think it's just going to be on
your past taste, but it'll be putting
your past taste with other people who
look like you and then surprising you
with some new choices as well. I think
that's ultimately going to be the
winner.
>> Ultimately, so much will come down to
taste, right? In this world,
>> uh, well, listen, taste, convenience,
price,
>> right? I mean, you and I may be lucky
enough where taste is
>> the overriding factor, but there may be
context for you, right? If you're um
coming to San Francisco and it's
midweek, you may want a cheap, decent
place close to the Uber offices,
>> right? And that's a different context
than if you are going to go to Napa for
the weekend
>> where you want an experience either for
yourself, for yourself and friends or
loved ones. So, I do think that it's not
as simple in terms of taste. is based on
the context of what the what what you're
um what you're solving for you know your
objective function and your objective
function is going to change uh based on
the context of what the goal of that
trip is
>> so D I was trying to define what Uber is
today you mentioned Barry and Match.com
>> are you Match.com in a different way
>> I mean to some extent we're bringing uh
obviously riders and drivers together
and we're trying to meet match eaters
with our restaurant partners with a
courier. So there is some of that. But
listen, I think one way that I think
about it from a consumer standpoint, you
know, Uber is different thing to Uber to
different people. For the consumer, I
really want Uber to be like that
operating system for your everyday life.
You know, we make your everyday life a
little bit easier. We give you a little
bit of time and convenience back in
terms of where you want to go. Um what
you want to eat more and more what you
want, right? If you want that iPhone
same day, we'll do that for you. Uh for
our driver and courier partners, we are
a source of of of work uh and a source
of earnings based on your own needs.
Now, you know, and and and you're you're
going to balance your needs based on the
commercial objectives as well. If your
need is that I only want to give rides
at 2 a.m. in the morning, you may not
make much money.
>> So, there's a combination of, you know,
the marketplace combines what when you
want to work with the realities of the
commercial objectives. Hey, 9:00 p.m.
Friday night, you may not want to work,
but it's a great time to work
>> in San Francisco. And then for
restaurant partners, you know, we're a
trusted partner in bringing a source of
demand in terms of uh delivery and now
retail and groceries that's only going
to grow. You know, what we see is the
convenience that we offer in terms of uh
delivery of starting food now, but
everything that convenience is
absolutely dynamite. It's pe it's
something that people want all over the
world and as they experience it more and
more people want it.
This is funny, but I was I got in last
evening.
>> Hope you took an Uber. No,
>> I have a driver here. But
>> uh I wanted an adapter. Uh I'm using a
lap I'm using a couple of laptops which
have India plug points and I needed a
travel adapter.
>> And at 8:30 p.m.
>> I was trying to like IDate. My hotel
didn't have one.
>> Sure. Uh Target,
Best Buy shuts down at 8:00 p.m. Uh
Walgreens had one store which was open
up until 10:00 p.m. I tried to download
Instacart on my phone which said I
couldn't do it unless I have a US
number.
>> Oh yeah, sure.
>> Yeah. So,
>> did you try Eats?
>> Does Uber Eatats have travel adapters?
>> Yeah.
>> Yes.
>> And can I have an international? One of
that's one of the issues with actually
the name right when we got out of um
when we wanted to expand from food to
grocery and other items we actually
tested is Uber Eats the right name with
consumers
>> and we found that consumers thought that
it would carry you know like it's and
you've seen a lot of our branding well
you may not have seen it because in
India we don't have Uber Eats
unfortunately it breaks my heart
>> in 2020 right
>> uh yes yes uh we partnered um there We
we didn't think we could win in India
and we wanted to really focus on
mobility.
>> Um but Eats now has groceries, it's got
retail and I'll bet you you could have
found that travel adapter. So lesson
learned for you next time.
>> And by the way, Eats is now available on
the on the rides app too.
>> Nice. You sold Uber Eats to Zamato
>> for for 400 500 million. I think you had
a 10% equity in Zamato in turn and
>> they got a great deal.
>> Yeah. And then you got out of Zumato
altogether as well. Yes.
>> Which is called Eternal. Now
>> I didn't know
>> they changed the name of the company.
>> Why is that? Why did you get out? What
did you understand or learn about the
Indian market?
>> We we got out not because of some deep
thought as it relates to Indian market
but my belief that
we're not a holding company. We're not
investment company. I I am that is not
my core competency
>> to take Uber investors capital and
invest it really well.
>> My competency is to build a big
operating business that over a period of
time you know grows topline brings in
lots of consumers all over the world and
ultimately you know throws off a lot of
profitability and and and we can build a
a share price. my skill in terms of
investment
uh is not going to be a significant
factor in the value creation here. So I
believe in kind of sticking you know
could I have had a wonderful
intellectual time on trying to determine
if if I should sell Zamato now or later
or 10 years from now sure but that
that's not my core competence. So I want
I like to stick to my core competence.
>> Would you buy Zamato today?
>> I don't know. I haven't looked at it
actually.
>> Right.
>> Yeah.
>> So
>> I mean they they've done a great job.
the food the food delivery business and
now the instant grocery business in like
blinket I've heard is actually larger
than the core business was right so
>> growing faster
>> yeah yeah very much so
>> so Uber is about 57% mobility 30%
delivery uh for today I'm going to
ignore freight because I think it's
growing at the lowest pace as well
>> I get it
>> uh and I'm going to be a 20-year-old boy
or girl in India trying to build a
business in either mobility, delivery,
quick commerce, and maybe we get advice
from DH as to what to build and what the
opportunities are.
>> Oh, that's a Well, first I'd say don't
try to build anything against Uber cuz
we'll kick your ass
>> and you can buy us later.
>> How how big are network effects? Because
you're already in so many markets and so
big. I'm guessing it's very hard to
service a customer who wants to hire a
Uber at 3:00 a.m. and 3 3:00 a.m. and 6
p.m.
>> Yeah.
>> Unless you have network.
>> Yeah.
>> The the network effects are very very
significant. Now, and so I do think that
to
invest in and build the required
liquidity on both sides of the market is
going to be very very difficult. Now the
network effects to some extent can be
local right so the the liquidity that we
have in Bangalore may be different from
the liquidity that we have in hydrobot
>> so I do think that there's an
opportunity and maybe rapid took
advantage of that opportunity of
building out services in smaller cities
and then building out liquidity in a way
that's not quite as expensive because
you're not trying to take on all of
India but go city by city by city and
then get into larger cities is um they
started with I think two wheelers and
three-wheers. They're trying to get into
autos etc. So I think if you find a
niche
where you believe that you can build
liquid supply and demand on a local
basis and then you can rinse and repeat
that over and over again. It's
essentially what Travis did when with
Uber when he founded it.
>> That is something that could work. Uh
and if you get large enough maybe then
and it might be a different segment
let's say inter city for example or some
other segment that isn't particularly
well served by the Ubers of the world or
the Zamadas of the world or some of the
other players then maybe that you can
build something that could either
compete with them or could be bought by
them.
>> That's an interesting insight.
Uh, I watched a bunch of your interviews
and
>> I'm sorry.
>> No, they were actually really nice.
>> Thank you.
>> Uh, Travis, they say that in in society
today as a leader, you're either
all inspiring, dogmatic,
uh, or you're somebody who builds
consensus, is more relatable, per se.
Mhm.
>> Have you had to project
a more relatable image cuz you have to
overcompensate for what Travis was
projecting? I one one thing that I
really believe in is um I don't think it
works if you're trying to be someone
other than who you are. You know, people
come to me and they they ask me for
leadership advice. And the first piece
of advice that I give them is be true to
yourself because the minute you're not
true to yourself, people will smell that
a mile off if you're not authentic. You
know, this is word that people mean
authentic, etc. What does it mean? It's
just like be true to who you are. I am
uh the youngest brother of a really big
family. Mhm.
>> We have like thousands of cousins
around.
>> Mhm.
>> And in Iran, community and family is so
important.
>> Nobody's the star. And if you're the
star, you're going to be put in your
place. You know, I'm a fancy fancy CEO
here.
>> Uh but when I go to my family,
>> I'm just one of the younger cousins and
I'm no big deal. And I love it.
>> It's such a relief to be that person who
I just that's my comfort zone. So I tend
to be more collaborative. You know, I I
when I played sports, I I would play
defense. I always played team sports. I
didn't want to win as an individual. I
love the feeling of winning as a team. I
I you know, I don't want to be there
celebrating by myself. I always
celebrate with my team,
>> right?
>> So that is who I am. And maybe that's
one of the reasons why I I wound up here
uh here. And actually my challenge as a
leader
>> is to get out of that collaborative mode
sometimes and to really drive. And for
example, I'll give you a little story
and it's a funny story but it just
taught me a lot. Um we were uh during co
>> Mhm.
>> in the US CO was devastating to our
business. Mobility was 90% of our
business and by far you know the
profitable piece of the business. And
overnight we lost 80 85% of our volume.
couldn't be worse. And and we went from
we were already losing two billion a
year. We went from losing two billion a
year to like losing four billion a year.
It was a disaster. And it became very
clear that we had to um undergo layoffs.
>> Mhm.
>> Not a fun time. I never thought I'd come
to Uber to to lay off thousands of
people. And me being me, I was um
talking to my team. What do you think we
should do? What are the levels? where
should we I didn't want to do a peanut
butter kind of a layoff etc. I want to
be focused and I would do meeting after
meeting after meeting with my team
because I wanted them all included and I
want to hear what they had to say. and
Nelson Chay uh my CFO at the time he we
were talking and he's like Dar you know
um we have a lot of respect for you and
you're a really good person
>> and we've talked about this a lot why
don't you just tell us what you want to
do cuz you tell us what you want to do
we're right behind you
>> and I was like my god like sometimes
>> collaboration etc talking about things
doesn't help and as a leader you have to
go from collabor you know, from peace
time collaboration mode to wartime, like
I am the leader, I'm the general, I'm
going to make a decision mode. And and
there like I didn't sleep that much that
night, but the next day I got everyone
together. I'm like, here's what we're
going to do. We cut deep in operations.
We cut less deep on on tech. Um we it
was very very difficult, but like we
went and everyone was behind me. and
while it was a really really difficult
time to some extent that brought the
team together. Um it allowed Uber Eats
to grow to incredible levels. Uh and I
think it made us a better company. I
would never ever want to go through that
again but made us a better company. So
for me my um my
general comfort zone is collaboration,
working with the team, listening to the
team. But then what I've learned is
there are certain circumstances where
you have to switch your modes.
>> And so I'll switch from collaboration to
decision. Here's what we're going to do.
And because my team sees me listening,
collaborating most of the time, I think
they give me credit when I say, "All
right, we're going to go this way." So
it it's who I am.
>> Yeah. I've been noticing, I might be
wrong in this,
in a David versus Goliath world,
David seems to have started winning
quite often. Uh, which kind of doesn't
make sense because we are largely a
trust deficit planet.
But a lot of people I know I think it's
weirdly correlated to affluence want to
pick the smaller guy the smaller brand
uh individuals over corporations
>> in such a world I get that relatable
makes a lot more sense than all
inspiring dogmatic
>> but how does a company like Uber which
is uh 40 plus billion in revenue and
millions of rides and employees and all
of
How do you evolve to project the David
image while you already have all of
this?
>> I I do think that there is first of all
I feel like David when you know we're
competing in
a technology world of trillion dollar
plus companies, right? So while we may
be a larger company, um I don't feel
like we're a big company at Uber.
uh we've done well as a company but like
I think there's so much more that we can
do. So I see our shortcomings much more
than our accomplishments and I think
that there is um it's part of the
culture of the company which is not to
overestimate ourselves and and to act
like a like a disruptor etc.
>> Do you do that consciously project
vulnerability?
>> Um Goliath doesn't
>> I think I think it's kind of who I am.
It goes back to my family. There's
there's a my father was like a really
modest person.
>> Mhm.
>> And
he would the minute I kind of thought I
was hot I don't know if I'm
allowed to say that. You know, he he put
me, you know, he he would just throw me
on my in my place. So,
>> I think part of it is who I am. I think
part of it is is where Uber came from.
Remember, like we we were the upstarts.
like this company wouldn't exist
>> if we weren't challenging the the the
status quo.
>> But how do you continue to look like the
upstart tomorrow if the world picks you?
>> I hope so. Now, now I would tell you
that internally
I do we are upstarts and I want to have
that upstart mentality here.
We do have to recognize the power that
we have and I do think that's a mistake
that Uber made early on which is we had
to fight for our lives but then at some
point you know we did get large we had
incredible impact in the cities in which
we operated with in and that does come
with with that does come with
responsibility
and so I do think there's there's this
weird kind of dualism about our identity
>> which is internally we want to feel like
upstarts all the time. Like every single
day we're fighting for our lives. Um we
we we hire from a lot of big tech
companies and we say like come here,
you're going to work your ass off.
You'll probably make a little bit less
money, but you're going to like the work
that you do can truly a an individual
engineer at Uber can have huge effect
across a company. And that that is
really cool. And at the same time,
the effect that you have on the company
also has an effect on society too
because we are big. And so there's this
dualism that you have to keep within
Uber, which is within these walls, we're
going to act like a startup, but outside
of the walls and discussions we have
with regulators and discussions that we
have with our drivers, our couriers, our
restaurants, recognize we're a big
company and that does come with
responsibility.
Um, and it means that just because you
can do something doesn't mean you
should.
>> This is some advice I want personally.
uh at some point Uber had different
teams attacking different cities. Yes.
>> For market share and these teams almost
competed with each other and netn net it
seemed to work well for Uber.
>> I tend to do this very organically with
people I have. I don't know if it's good
in the long run or bad but I make them
compete with each other.
>> Sure.
>> What have you learned? Does it work?
um
it works as a growth tactic but it
doesn't scale. So to some extent what
you want to do is you want to have these
humans and teams compete against each
other to hack your way
into the best solution possible. Mhm.
>> Then after they get to that best
solution possible, you then have to come
in and automate that solution, you know,
through alos, through engineering, etc.
And then what was the frontier becomes a
part of the core and then you move to
the next frontier. So that's kind of the
design spec that we have. You know, the
the team is actually very very
entrepreneurial. you know like we Uber
teams to some extent was an amalgamation
of a bunch of technologies that we built
and our CPO Sachin he kind of had he's
like he was obsessed with that idea he's
like well we have a bunch of safety
functionality here we can put together
teams with our safest drivers we have
tracking functionality here I'm going to
put this whole thing together and hack
together what you call this teen
solution and
you hack it you move quickly. You see if
there's product market fit and then once
you see the signal that there's product
market fit, you do have to systematize
it because if you don't systematize it,
you can't scale. So, you have to have
both muscles within the organization,
>> but it's a good way to discover
something faster.
>> Totally. You you don't want to like it
that that
the signal. We don't do this anymore,
but at at Expedia in the olden days, you
know, we like put a button
>> um on the website just to see if there's
demand for that button, and someone, you
know, would click it. They'd be like,
"Oh, I'm sorry. is not working right now
and we're just doing it to collect
signal. You know that that's the biggest
hack possible, right?
>> Um so so
and once you see that product market
fit, you got to you got to build behind
it and some companies make the mistake
of not building behind it and you can
get away with it for a while but at some
point the system falls apart.
>> When you speak about Door Dash or when
you when you spoke about uh Zomato right
now you complimented them, praised them.
Uh, I heard you on a interview speaking
about how Door Dash went after the
suburbs and you guys missed out.
>> You praising competition,
is that
a way to appear more David in a David
versus Goliath world? Again,
>> it it's not it's not a it's not an act,
>> right?
>> Um, I think Door Dash is a really great
company. I don't like them.
>> Yeah. But they make us better. Uh, and
they're a worthy competitor, global
competitor. Uh, they're beating us right
now in the US, but not for long.
>> And we're beating them outside the US.
And the two companies going against each
other makes both companies better and
actually builds a better service for
consumers and couriers and restaurants
all over the world. Um, I I think you
know the the humility that we talked
about before, I think that actually
creates a strength because you're
curious. You're not overconfident.
>> You don't think like you're the best in
the world. You're curious about what
others are doing.
>> Um, and for me, it motivates me and
drives me to be better. You know, if I
say Door Dash is a is a good competitor
and they are a good competitor, that's
motivation for me and my team to be
better.
You said outside US you're beating them
and they're beating you here. Does India
>> for long though in the US?
>> Does India as a market matter? Dar you
once observed when you were there that
Indians are very demanding and they
don't want to pay for anything.
>> That that that comment cost me. It um it
it matters hugely for us, right? Uh it's
India is now our third largest market in
terms of mobility trips.
>> Mhm. Uh we've got I think over 1.4
million now drivers,
auto you know two wheelers, three-wheers
and and four-wheelers in India. Uh the
growth there is spectacular. I think
India is already one of the great
countries in the world but if you look
at it as a share of GDP it's only going
to increase. uh the leadership there is
amazing and and so much of our talent
pool not just in India but all over the
world comes from Indian descent as well.
So India is you know it is a absolute
mustwin for Uber not just tomorrow but
10 years from now. I'm going to go back
to being a 20-year-old who's starting a
business in this industry.
>> You know, I say don't start one in this
industry. Go go go try something else.
>> How do I recognize the opportunity
versus damn like the total addressable
market like if I want to start quick
commerce in India
>> and the cost of delivery is say 20
rupees or 30 rupees or 50 rupees.
If the total addressable market that can
afford a product like that in India be
20 million people or 50 million people
where is the number right a lot of the
spend a lot of consumption in India is
still going towards groceries as much as
50 60%.
So how do I justify to myself that my
business idea is sound that I'm going to
charge 50 rupees a delivery? How many
people do I model for? Where does that
fit come across geographies?
>> I say you're way overthinking it.
>> Um you know businesses never
businesses that succeed are always
adapting and adjust and adjusting. So
what I tell you is figure out if there's
product market fit in that narrow
segment. Call it the 50. And by the way,
if it's narrow, that's great because
then the big players are probably not
going to come after it. It's a segment
where you can add value and it's a
segment where you can own and then if
you establish product market fit and you
build a business there, then you can
go to the next area to the next area to
the to the next area. But if my market
size is only 20 million people who can
afford it, still build it.
>> Build it as long as there's product
market fit in terms of unit economics,
that makes sense.
>> And once you get to those 20 million
people, you're going to find an
adjacency to get into. And then you'll
find another agency and you'll find
another.
>> But then I'm competing with people like
you who already are sitting on the
network network effects in
>> Yeah. But the the the big TAMs are going
to be taking. So actually specifically
you should go after the small tamps
right and the small opportunities where
you can create a network effect without
enormous investments either in
technology or development or or monies.
You you actually specifically should go
after the small TAMs and then work your
way into the adjacencies over a period
of time. I wasn't around, but at the
time, you know, the when Uber East was
conceived of, I think it was Jason Droi
and Travis, they were they were like
driving around a bunch of cars with
burritos in the trunk of that car. It
was it was like a manifestation of
mobility.
>> Mhm.
>> Um, a very close manifestation. And you
look at where delivery has gone and how
large it's become,
you know, I don't think they would have
ever predicted that. So you just get one
step to the next step to the next step.
I don't believe in overthinking TAM. I
think TAMs are like you build those for
IR and you build those to raise money.
You may you may want to create this
wonderful dramatic TAM to go raise, you
know, a couple million bucks. But that's
not what should be processing through
your mind. It should be can I build a
service that has eventually strong unit
economics that then I can build on top
of.
Quickcommerce seems to have sidestepped
the US for a long time. I think you went
to big box retail and then you went to
another thing altogether.
>> Yeah.
>> Not necessarily competing on I will
deliver in 6 minutes, I will deliver in
seven and I will deliver in eight.
>> Why is that?
>> Because the cost of labor in the US is
too high. So I my that that's my take
which is um
with quick commerce uh you can't
automate that much because the cost of
the automation doesn't bear out in a
small box.
>> So you have to use human labor.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh the co and so in markets where the
cost of human labor and is not there and
the concentration of of customers isn't
there
>> you get a fail. uh which is for example
let's say in the US
>> right
>> um you know I think that go is making a
good run at it
>> but you look at the development of that
market versus uh blinket or some of the
other developing markets it is
absolutely working much much better in
lowerc cost labor markets than it is in
high-cost labor markets
>> is there a arbitrage there because your
drivers are not essentially employees is
there a labor cost arbitrage cuz their
gig workers. They run their own cars.
They don't need to be paid benefits,
insurance.
>> Yeah. There's there's a trade-off there,
right? Which is we can't tell our
drivers when and when to work, right? So
imagine if Starbucks is hiring a
barista, they don't go to the barista,
hey, show up whenever you want to, and
you know, we'll pay you however much a
Starbucks barista makes per hour. So you
could call it a labor arbitrage. I I
call it a trade-off which is the driver
and the courier can decide when and
where they want to work. That creates
cost for us. We then have to build
liquidity of of of supply and demand.
And sometimes we will
use incentives and or algorithms for
example surge or circumstances when uh
when demand exceeds supply. And in those
cases, we have to actually raise prices
for that demand in order to attract
enough drivers to get out into the
market to pick out to pick up everyone,
you know, arriving at 7:00 p.m. on a
Thursday night at the airport or, you
know, when when uh the Warriors uh game
is is done,
>> right?
>> So,
it it it's it's I wouldn't it's not an
arbitrage mechanism. Um it is a tradeoff
that also is an enormous benefit to uh
certain people who don't want to work on
a schedule who want to work less than 40
hours a week. You know 70% of our
drivers and couriers are working less
than 20 hours a week. So it it is a
unique product market fit that we found.
It works for drivers and couriers. It
works for us. We have to build very
complex systems in order to make it
work. Um, and I think overall when you
look at society, it's it's good for
society, right? It's a service both for
the drivers and for customers that works
and and I think more and more societies
are are appreciating that.
>> You've spoken about autonomous vehicles
a bunch of times and
>> uh I don't know if it'll happen sooner
or later than you predict,
>> but
>> everyone's been wrong so far, so who
knows? Well, I mean the predictions
generally of autonomous and when they're
when it's going to be ready for market,
>> you know, this is a this is a problem
that uh Whimo has been working on
probably for 15 20 years.
>> Yeah.
>> Um and it's proven out to be a much more
difficult problem to solve than anyone
expected, but finally it's working now.
I mean, the the Whimo product is
spectacular and there are others
building out the product as well. I was
at a junction last evening and there was
a fire truck behind a Whimo.
>> Interesting.
>> And I I didn't I couldn't
>> sirens on.
>> The sirens were on
>> and the Whimo actually did this
interesting maneuver where it went
right, stopped there, waited for the
fire truck to go. It was incredible.
>> Yeah. Perfect.
>> What do you think wins? uh Veos tech or
Teslas cameras, LAR, radar.
>> I personally believe that autonomous
vehicles have to have superhuman levels
of safety. I don't think it's good
enough for them to be better than
humans. They have to be multiple times
better than humans. And Whimo's
certainly proven that that's possible.
So, why not take that shot? Mhm.
>> Um I think in the near term it's going
to be very difficult and Elon would tell
me I'm wrong and never bet against them
but it's my instinct that in the near
term it's going to be very difficult to
build a camera only product that has
superhuman levels of safety. And again
now at some point will it be possible?
Quite possibly yes. But if you can have
um instrumentation that includes cameras
and LAR and the cost of LAR, you know,
solid state LAR now is
400, 500 bucks. Why not
>> include LAR as well in order to achieve
superhuman safety. So possible, yeah, it
will be possible. I don't know when,
>> but is the possible the better product?
I'm not sure. I would I all of our
partners um that we're working with now
are using a combination of uh camera,
radar, and LAR. And you know, I
personally think that's that's the right
solution, but I could be proven wrong.
>> What happens to Uber's earners when
if autonomous becomes safer and cheaper?
>> Mhm. One could argue that putting a
human behind a wheel is a disservice
because you're putting somebody at risk.
At that point, what happens to all the
earners who are working with Uber?
>> Well, I think it's not just earners.
It's it's then why should humans drive,
right? Society would be uh I think there
are about a million auto related
fatalities in the world. So, why not
save those lives?
>> Um I I think that that is it's an
inevitability for that to happen. So,
it's not just drivers, but also
>> bottle drivers, whether professional or
not, wouldn't drive anymore. And and I
think that would be a good outcome for
society. I do think we have time.
>> How much
>> between
>> I think it's a it's a good 20 years, you
know, because right now um the drivers,
the autonomous drivers are safer but
much more expensive
>> uh even in developed markets that have
high labor costs. So for autonomous to
come into India is going to take a long
time in terms of cost of hardware coming
down. So so 20 years I'm describing as
an end state. You know within 10 years
you're going to see a significant number
of autonomous vehicles especially in
developed markets and I think that's a
very good things in terms of safety. Uh,
and what we're trying to do is make sure
we communicate with our drivers
appropriately. And it's very, very small
at this point. It's a teeny teeny part
of rides in in any markets. And we're
actively looking to create other work
opportunities for those drivers as well.
So for example, I'm actually going to go
to a meeting later today of uh a new
group that we built, Uber AI solutions
that is using our gig workers and then
other specialist workers as well for you
know AI labeling, translation, all kinds
of um needs and products that actually
serve these AI models, some of which may
be autonomous or not. um that ultimately
are going to be doing a bunch more of
the manual work not just driving but the
manual work that many workers do today.
>> I was having this debate with a friend
of mine back in India and they were like
autonomous for India with the cows and
dogs and carts and all of that. But when
you think about it,
>> if a computer has a reaction time which
is faster than a human,
>> an autonomous vehicle should do better
with more arbitrary things like this at
play.
>> Totally. I I I think the it's just a
question of training.
>> Um and if uh if autonomous vehicles can
figure out New York City traffic, you
know, India traffic is harder.
>> Mhm. uh but it's only an issue of
training on additional data sets and
improving the capabilities there.
>> Yeah. And I don't want to be unfair with
this question of what happens in 20
years to earners if
>> even if it takes 20 years because
>> I could extrapolate the same thing for
so many industries where AI will disrupt
their jobs in 20 years.
>> Yeah. It's a societal issue.
>> Yeah. But what happens to society?
What has happened to society repeatedly
and repeatedly is that the workforce has
adjusted
over and over again, right? Every single
time when um more of manufacturing was
automated, there's always this drama of
oh my god, what happens to the people
and people figure it out and people
usually then go to higher uh value types
of labor and you know unemployment rate.
We our world has more automation today
than it ever has been and unemployment
rates are at historical lows in most uh
developed countries. I think the
question is whether or not this is a
unique time and circumstance where the
change is going to happen faster than it
ever has before. And based on the rate
of technological change there, there's
reason to believe that yeah, maybe this
time
may happen faster than societies
historically have been able to adjust to
change. Um, I don't know that yet.
>> Uh, I don't think it's a problem for
Uber. It's a problem for Well, it is a
it is a potential issue for Uber and it
could be a real problem. Mhm.
>> Um but it's a big societal problem that
we all have to have to take on. But
there's also opportunity there. You
know, how can we educate our workforce
and bring to them opportunities that
ultimately allow them to live the kinds
of life that they that they want to?
Our, you know, kind of building Uber AI
solutions is one small step in that
direction. But believe me, we don't have
all the answers.
Do you suspect Dara that you might lose
access to data like you have now? If
tomorrow say Elon saying that Tesla will
not need Uber or even Whimo, I'm
guessing a lot of the data is controlled
by the hardware and less by who booked
the VHO.
Well, I I think that we actually now
have uh we're collecting data using
Lucid Cars in a bunch of uh cities as
well. So, I think for Uber data is not
going to be a problem.
>> Uh and we will have data uh capture
capabilities. We'll work with our
partners to capture uh data as well and
then provide them to our partners all
over the world. And based on the growth
that we see, our access to data is only
going to increase.
>> Right. Uh Travis is doing ghost
kitchens.
>> Yes.
>> I watched a interview of his where he
was speaking about how this could change
how we eat.
>> Any view on that? Do you think that's
going to happen?
>> I I think it's inevitable. Um I think
it'll take time. You know, change in the
real world really takes time,
>> but I've been super impressed with what
Travis has done with Ghost Kitchens and
now he's working on robotics as well
>> to automate more of the of the cooking
process
>> and bringing, you know, healthy natural
food to more people with less labor.
Like that's really really cool. And he's
a he's a terrific partner of ours. Like
we work with cloud kitchens all over the
world. um they're a big partner and you
know Travis is a uh is an entrepreneur
that you should not underestimate.
>> Any view on what could happen to
restaurants? Dra like I know a bunch of
them large chains back home who
>> constantly complain about the 15 to 30%
they end up paying uh delivery operators
and they talk about how it's
unsustainable. add to that you have the
data and you start Dark Kitchens or what
Travis is doing. What happens to an old
school restaurant business?
>> Well, I think an old school restaurant
business that can't adjust is going to
suffer. They're going to lose share.
>> Mhm.
>> And so I think it's it's a job of the
old school restaurant business to become
a new school restaurant business. How do
you do that? Well, I I think if if you
break down what restaurants do is
there's a component which is
food,
>> right? Giving you great food that you
enjoy.
>> Mhm.
>> And there's another component which is
hospitality,
>> right?
>> Which is come to this restaurant and
there's an environment that you might
enjoy, etc. And there's the there's the
mood, there's the romance of a of a
restaurant as well. I think that what
you will there are certain restaurants
where the hospitality part of the
offerings um is not quite as is is not
as significant right it's um
>> McDonald's is more about the food
>> than it is about going sitting in
McDonald's and enjoying you know the
seating there is about the food and the
brand and affordable food available
quickly to so many people right and so I
do think that those depending on the
kind of food that you're providing. If
it's about the food, then you will have
to make this transition to either
drive-thru or delivery
>> because you're not adding much value in
terms of hospitality. Uh, and in those
kinds of circumstances, what cloud
kitchens
>> offers you, which is a more
industrialized way of still providing
really healthy food to someone and the
hospitality there is, well, I want to
eat at home. I love my home.
>> Um, that is essentially where that
system is going to go. And yes, will it
take share from the classic uh from the
classic restaurant business? the will,
but it's also actually um extending the
share of restaurant eating or restaurant
food as a percentage of overall food
consumption. If you look at restaurant
sales, restaurant sales are growing
faster than grocery sales, right?
>> Because these restaurants are providing
a better product more affordably, more
conveniently. And then I do think that
there will be certain restaurants where
>> you know that hospitality that that the
third place that Starbucks was so good
at, I think Brian Nichols is trying to
bring in
>> the feel that part of it um is still I
think going to sing, you know, the
romance of going to a restaurant.
>> And so I think that those two the
utility and the romance are going to be
separable. Uh, and you as a restaurant
have to understand where you want to be
cuz I think the middle is going to be a
difficult place to to live. But the
restaurant industry is adjusting.
>> Mhm.
>> Um, just like every single industry has
to adjust. You've got to change in order
to keep up with the times.
>> So, Dra, you talk about ads on Uber.
>> Yes.
>> And I have found this even with myself
that when I'm searching for something
today, I don't use Google anymore. I end
up using Perplexity or OpenAI or someone
like that.
>> Sure.
>> Uh
if I want to build a brand tomorrow and
I want to market and nobody's landing on
Google ads, uh what happens to the world
of ads? How does a brand get built?
How do I get the word out that I've
started this new t-shirt company? Well,
I think that those surfaces for a brand
to truly get built are there in terms of
Instagram and Tik Tok and and Facebook,
right? So, the the Google ad world, the
perplexity ad world, etc. are built for
um for searches based on intent.
And and so I think that that medium is
about growing brands, not establishing
or inventing brands. But I actually
think that the surface area for brand
new brands to um to to grow and thrive,
it it's actually greater than that than
than it ever has been. I I'll tell you a
little story of of my niece.
>> Mhm.
>> Um Liliana. She she's incredible. She
she is
study humanities, loves fashion, loves
golf, built um a wanted to build a new
golf brand which is like fun, great, you
know, fashionable clothes for for women.
She she went on um uh she she used
MidJourney, taught herself how to use
MidJourney,
>> designed all of the designs on
MidJourney, then went out and sourced uh
her clothing with uh I think it's uh
some Chinese players and Indian players
and I think a couple of other places uh
got the clothing and now she has is
building this Lily Hummer brand um and
using Tik Tok and and using Instagram uh
as her distribution mechanisms and also
going to like these traditional golf
clubs etc. She could not have done that
10 years ago.
>> So I actually think this is a magical
time with the tools that you have um at
your arsenal uh and the manufacturing
prowess all around the world at your
disposal. It's a great time to build
brands and I think the surfaces are
there as long as you have a story,
you've got a personality, and you have a
something distinctive to add.
>> You're saying social media is still the
go-to place.
>> Oh, yeah. Now,
you know, would Liliana have the the you
know, would she do well on Google? No.
>> But that that's not the surface, you
know, that's a surface, let's say, for
Lululemon, not not her.
>> U with the current president's
immigration policies. Mhm.
>> Do you think labor cost for your earners
will go up significantly?
>> The cost of labor will not go up
directly.
>> Mhm.
>> Because I think the vast majority of
drivers, couriers, etc. are legal in
terms of their immigration uh status.
But to some extent, we compete with the
labor market
>> in terms of the rates that uh our
drivers want to make per hour. So I
think in an indirect way it could have
an effect on us but I don't think it'll
have a direct effect on us.
>> Right. So D I have a fund back home in
India and I spent
>> You have a fund?
>> I have a fund. Yeah. Like a private
equity fund.
>> Sure.
>> And I
>> How's it doing?
>> It's doing decent I think.
>> I spent a lot of the last couple of
years buying into the transition into
electric mobility.
>> Interesting.
>> So we got everything from electric
scooters to trucks to buses. We even did
electric flying taxi investment
recently.
>> All over the world or in India
specifically?
>> Uh a little bit all over the world but
more focused on that region.
>> Have you seen Chinese electric vehicles
by the way? They're incredible. Right.
>> They are unbelievable. It is
>> the the innovation coming out of the
Chinese OEM and EV business. It It's
I've never seen anything like it. It's
extraordinary.
>> Why though? Why why are they so far
ahead of everyone else now?
>> Because of the competition. I I I think
that there's this um
belief I I'd say from from the US and
and a lot of uh of of Western countries
that China is a planned economy.
>> Okay. And China is a planned economy
from a strategic standpoint. And for
example, you know, they want to get into
manufacturing, EVs, etc. And so while
that comes top down from the government
then actually the way these industries
grow is every you know Chinese
significant city or province etc wants
their own EV uh company to succeed. So
in China now there are over a hundred
OEMs in China, well over a hundred.
>> And so then there's this bottoms up
competition that's based on the top down
strategy that the government sets. So
you have the kind of the best of both
worlds, which is you have industrial
policy, but then the winners aren't
whose buddies with the president,
>> right?
>> The winners are who wins in a brutal
competitive environment. So the winners,
you know, coming out of China, the
Gile's of the world, the BYDs, you know,
the these the they have been they've
been through the ringer. And so it
really is survival of fittest. And the
innovation that we see and the speed of
development there, it's it's
extraordinary.
>> In a free market, can anyone compete in
catchup? No tariffs, nothing, no duties.
>> In a free market, can anyone catch up to
to China? Of course, people can catch
up. I I think that you know when you
look at the Korean manufacturers there
there's a ton of talent there but I
think if you look at my expectation is
overall share especially in the EV
sector on a global basis of EVs is going
to be um is going China's way for a
while but individual
uh innovative OEMs they're going to do
fine
>> so say I'm a scooter company in India uh
I don't have the scale that Chinese
manufacturers or OEMs have today. How do
I compete?
>> Cuz they're building at a 100x scale
that I am.
>> I mean, listen, it um I don't have a I
don't know enough about uh the Indian
industrial sector.
>> But based on the innovation that I see
out of India and the talent, there's got
to be a way to compete. you know it it
it's
what we what I see out of India it's
it's very very special I think that um
especially in IT industries
India really has risen
>> um and I think manufacturing
is still somewhat nent relative to the
size and potential of India but there's
no doubt we'll get there
>> I had this thesis that all vehicles will
be electric by x amount of time but the
adoption seems to have slowed down.
>> Why is that?
>> Subsidies are going away.
>> Yeah, so subsidies are going away now. I
I do think that in um in Europe and
China it's definitely happening. Uh I do
think that it requires
substantial
investment over a long period of time in
the infrastructure charging
infrastructure of cities. Mhm.
>> And so the societies that have
continued to make way there
>> uh you are seeing the product you're
you're seeing EV penetration
uh continue to improve. And within Uber,
>> you know, um we are moving to EVs five
times faster than the general public. So
EVs inside of the Uber system are
definitely increasing. Uh, and from my
standpoint, I'm hoping that we continue
to increase the penetration of EVs. And
the next driver that you want switching
from a combustion engine to an EV is
actually Uber driver because the average
Uber driver is driving four to five
times the mileage of the average driver.
So, we continue to push it. We're still
quite committed to um moving over to as
much sustainable uh both packaging for
our restaurants and EVs, but I would say
that it's gone much harder over the past
2 years.
>> So, if I make the bet today by investing
capital in the assumption that all
vehicles will be EV, do you think it's
still a fair bet?
>> Yes, it's a better technology, but it's
a question of you might want to pick
where you're investing.
>> Give me some advice. Where should I? Uh
well, China, no, there's too much
competition, but I I think that there's
still potential in Europe. And you know,
I I I look at the the the investments
going into the charging infrastructure
of local cities. That that's a signal
that I would look for,
>> right? With everything you're building,
D uh funnily enough, I had to tell you
this. There is a really popular wrestler
uh in India with the name Dar Singh.
>> Really?
>> Yeah. I don't know if I should call you
D because that's how we call it in India
or D as well.
>> Okay. With every
>> is he is he bigger than I am?
>> I think so.
>> I find that surprising.
>> I've never met him but I suspect he is.
He's much bigger than me too.
>> With everything you're building, Dra, uh
is there a super app coming? Is that the
eventual outcome?
I think that um
super apps seem to be particularly
relevant in uh in in Asia and China etc.
They've been quite successful there.
>> They've had less success in western
markets.
>> So I don't know if we will get to what
you would call a super app but we
certainly want to be a connected family
of apps. So if you if you go on Uber
now, Uber Mobility, we have Uber Eats
available to you and and people are are
transacting billions of dollars of Uber
Eats on the Uber mobility app.
>> And on on Eats, obviously we have
grocery, we have retail, you'll know
next time you need a travel uh adapter.
And so the the we we have I say
ecosystem
>> that is making it increasingly easier
for you to work from surface to surface
or with with a membership uh uh plan
Uber 1 that gives you discounts on on
both. So I absolutely know that we are
building kind of this local ecosystem
that local OS of yours. Um whether the
physical manifestation is a super app or
not, I don't know. Uh and my, you know,
kind of the way I view it is I'm going
to I'm going to let our engineers and
our product folks kind of innovate, come
up with the next idea and then we'll go
kind of one step in front of the other
to to get to that outcome.
>> I was thinking about this and I did a
little bit of research. Super apps tend
to work in societies without as much
rebellion in more
>> as much what
>> rebellion.
>> Yes. in pseudocialist societies, in more
capitalistic ones, everybody wants to
bet on the new guy, the young guy. The
same David Goliath argument.
>> I mean, I think I I think there might be
some of that, but there's also kind of
um phone storage and capabilities.
>> You know, having a separate app for all
all these different services may uh may
be a lot. And I think in
some of the more developed markets,
people will pay for that last 10 or 20%
of finetuning that maybe a super app
doesn't.
>> So I don't know whether it's societal or
it's a combination of society or
technology coming together.
>> It definitely hasn't worked in the west
though.
>> Last question. Dra,
you have been a successful investment
banker, a two-time CEO, Expedia, Uber,
sometimes joining midway and really
scaling the company.
>> If you were me, a 20-year-old boy or
girl in India and you had to start a
fresh, what would you build today and
who would you build it with? Who would
your co-founder be? Um,
so I always think people people should
know their own limits. I I am not a
startup person. That's not my skill. I'm
a scale person,
>> you know. I'm not the person to to kind
of start with with an idea fresh.
>> Uh, and I have enormous respect for
those rebels
>> who think that they can do it on their
own. My advice would be I I've always
said when when I give career advice to
people is I look for three things. Um,
one is I want to work for people who I
like and I can learn from.
>> Second is I want to go to a place where
I as an individual can make a
difference.
>> Mhm.
>> And third, I want to make a difference
at a place that matters in the world, is
making a difference in the world. Uh,
and actually that's why like investment
banking for me, like great people. I
thought I was pretty good, but it wasn't
I didn't get that jazz. I wasn't
changing the world. Mhm.
>> And so then when I saw Barry, I'm like,
>> great, I want to work for him
>> and we were, you know, really
on this path of the changing of the
world and hopefully helped it with
travel as well. And and I was really,
you know, I thought I was going to run
for Expedia for as long as Barry would
help me, but then for me Uber, the thing
that really excited me was how important
Uber was to the world and, you know, the
difference hopefully that I could make
as a as a CEO. I think a lot of young
people, they kind of think too much
about like how much money they're going
to make or this or that. It's like work
for people who you love or respect,
make a difference, and try to work at a
place that's making a difference, and
the rest takes care of itself.
>> Thank you, DH. This was a lot of fun,
and hopefully we do it again sometime
soon.
>> I think that'd be great.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.
[Music]
How did you hurt your hand?
>> Um, I was at camp uh with my kids and my
son uh Hugo is a keeper and I used to be
a keeper in uh uh in high school as
well. So, I thought it was a good idea
to to play keeper against him and all
the other camp counselors. And I got
carried away and I dogged to to make him
proud. So I I took this one for my boy.
