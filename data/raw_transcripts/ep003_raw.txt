what's the biggest misunderstanding
about you whenever you hear about
somebody who's got you know ridiculous
amounts of money their values are
different than your values you should be
concerned about their agenda what's your
biggest Fe I'll be sad as my brain gets
less capable that disappoints me tell me
one Behavior we all should adopt reading
a lot being a student that's a big part
of My Success richest and most powerful
men in the world Bill Gates has
Unleashed a technological Revolution
that has changed our lives Bill Gates of
25 and Bill Gates of 17 any change that
you feel personally in my 20s being a
maniac was the right thing my
competitors would say oh no you work too
hard and I'd say yes I do if you're in a
race your 20s when you have no wife and
no children that's the time to do
it if you get an opportunity to invite
three Indians for dinner who would that
be there was a mathematician ramanujan I
would have loved to have met him why do
you think India is becoming a Global
Talent capital for the world would hire
people from India and bring them to the
United States you know both the United
States and India were kind of mad at us
cuz we were taking you know the smart
people and moving them in India lot of
kids also fight with their parents on
inheritance have your kids ever spoken
to
[Music]
you before we start today's episode all
I want to say is thank you to each and
every one of you I'm really grateful
that we were able to sit down with one
of the most influential men in the world
the Bill
Gates I have being this young boy who
always used to hear stories about this
man about the kind of money he has made
the kind of lives he's impacting the
kind of things he's building through
Microsoft from there to be sitting in
front of him
it was surreal when I started the
conversation you could see it on my face
that I was really nervous really scared
I didn't know what to talk about but as
we went in the conversation the
podcaster in me took over and we spoke
about his fears his Mis understandings
the mission and what is he doing today
today I want you to see this episode
from a lens of a 20-year-old sitting
with Bill Gates and figuring out what
goes on in his brain this episode is
truly special because I could have never
thought that Bill Gates will be on our
podcast this soon in our journey I
always had a belief that we will be able
to sit down with the smartest people
around the world but it happen this
soon I can't believe this right now I
just want you to enjoy this episode the
way I did I want you to sink in that
this is happening because it's not
singing in with me and I just want to
tell you that there are more episodes
coming so keep supporting us and hit the
Subscribe button right
now welcome on figuring out sir I'll
tell you a little story so during the
pandemic me and my sister we were
watching the Netflix documentry inside
Bill's brain and halfway through it I
told my sister that hey you know what
like one day I'll sit with Bill Gates
and I'll directly speak to him and get
inside his brain and just randomly and
she was laughing so this one's for
you you did it so it's it's an
opportunity I don't know how it just
came out of my mouth and it's happening
today so thank you so much for doing
this well you've come to India quite
often tell me something that You' have
observed about India which a lot of
people don't know about well people
probably uh you know because they're
here all the time you know they probably
don't recognize how much things have
changed you know if you go away and come
back then you see wow you know the level
of Entrepreneurship and the uh you know
the amount of innovation that's actually
taking place here uh it's pretty
fantastic and you know for the
foundation we've been here originally
uh because a lot of the health
challenges were here and we still care a
lot about that but uh now a lot of our
invention is being done here whether
it's uh well vaccines obviously uh we
have some incredible Partnerships but
it's broadening to you know better seeds
better
Diagnostics uh you know the ways that we
can use AI uh for health or education uh
so the
uh Innovation ecosystem has really
exploded and that's going to be great
for India it's going to be great for the
world so when you meet other leaders
around the world or when you meet your
your billionaire friends what's the
first thing you tell them about India is
it the same thing what you just told me
um yeah it's
uh you know we've had such a great
experience uh in our work in India um
you know I encourage people to come and
tap into uh the great things uh going
on is there anything specific you tell
them well you know my connection with
India goes all the way back to the
Microsoft days when you know we at first
would hire people from India and bring
them to the United States and you know
both the United States and India were
kind of mad at us because we were taking
you know the smart people and moving
them and uh you know then they came back
here to India and created the Microsoft
India uh work which has you know been
absolutely fantastic so you know up
until the year 2000 I mainly knew the
tech uh scene so you know a lot of
Bangalore
hydrabad uh seeing the country more
broadly you know that's in my foundation
work so you know bear up um you know
seeing you know where we could partner
and and help with things uh you know I
still want to take more vacation here
I've done it a little bit but uh you
know there's a lot of great places in
India that I haven't been to talking
about Microsoft and taking people from
here to us uh people like
satella Sunder paii there have been
incredible CEOs around the world why do
you think India is becoming a Global
Talent capital for the world do you
think anything special here which is how
day well you know 20% of the world's
people live here in India and India's
had a particular emphasis on you know
engineering software you know and turned
out a lot of taught people and so when
you get people like suar SATA who are
both great at engineering and at
management you know that's a a magic uh
combination and you know so they you
know these companies you know are
looking anywhere in the world to find uh
uh that mix and you know so India's
getting about its fair share of those
top leadership positions and you know it
partly comes from having great
universities uh you know not just the
iits but starting with them um you know
that's using the incredible Talent
that's here
so talking about Indian
Talent you do a lot of philanthropy work
here and you've met a lot of talented
people here lot of rich people here as
well do you and you believe that all the
money that rich people have or like
people who have made wealth for
themselves they should use it for
charity work they should pledge it in
India there's a usually a lot of people
believe that as parents is their duty to
save everything for their kids for The
Inheritance right like the kids will get
everything what do you think is the
right mindset using all the money for
pledging and giving it back to the
society or giving it to the
children well I think you know everybody
gets to decide on that you know in my
case you know my kids got uh a great
upbringing in education but you know
less than 1% of the uh the total wealth
um because I decided it wouldn't be a
favor to them you know it's not a
dynasty you know I'm not asking them to
run Microsoft I want to give them a
chance to have their own earnings and
success you know be significant and not
overshadowed by the incredible luck and
good fortune I had and different
families see that differently I think
the people who've made uh fortunes from
technology are less
dynastic uh and you know so they they'll
even you know take their capital and
give a lot of that away you can have a
view of giving away your capital or just
giving away your earnings um and you of
course I love all
philanthropy uh but the tech sector is
the probably the most aggressive
about um you know giving most of it away
not the other sectors you've not seen
that in any other kind of industry where
people try to give not to the same
degree it tends to be uh giving more you
know of the giving some portion of the
profit as opposed to uh the the actual
base Capital you know in India a lot of
kids also fight their with their parents
on inheritance have your kids ever
spoken to you and be like hey why are
you not giving us everything or anything
has it ever happened um you know you
don't want your kids to ever be confused
used about your support for them and
your love for them and so I do think
explaining early on your
philosophy uh you know that you're going
to treat them all equally uh and that
you're going to give them incredible
opportunities uh but that you know the
highest calling uh for these resources
is uh to go back um to the neediest
through the foundation and you know
they've seen the success of the
foundation I hope they're very proud of
of the foundation and
um uh so you know I I've seen cases
where kids actually tell their parents
to be more philanthropic you know I
think the younger generation sometimes
actually uh is pushing against this idea
of uh uh you know the wealth just being
passed down uh
mostly um
yeah so that's so you know every
family's a a bit different I have last
question on India and then we'll get to
the foundation work and try to
understand you as
well if you get an opportunity to invite
three Indians for dinner Dead or Alive
who would there
be well I get to spend time with you
know some incredible uh people in Indian
you know I get time with the prime
minister and understand his
vision uh and how we fit into that this
you know
2047 uh uh thing that you know
everything is lining up to try to
achieve that you know I get to meet uh
there was a a great scientist Raj Bond
who created the uh Department of
biotechnology uh there was a
mathematician ramanan uh who I I would
have loved to have met him because he
was a uh you know almost mysterious how
he was so genius at what he was able to
do um you know the I got to work with
rotten Tata I'm getting to work with all
of the uh amazing philanthropists and uh
a lot of the innovators here you know I
get to see small companies early on I
just went through uh some of these uh
companies using Ai and health uh some
Pro for profit a few
uh
nonprofit um you know we had a great
25th
uh uh 25 year celebration and this great
sitar artist you know came and uh that
was a pretty special thing uh so it' be
hard for me to pick there's there's uh
so many incredible talents you can't
pick
three I I I think I defend uh some
people by not including them uh fair
fair okay you were talking about small
companies if you were to start something
from zero in India
today where would you put most of your
time and what the first step you'll take
well you'd mostly start a company
because you think you enjoy working on
something and you think you have a
worldclass understanding of you know a
unique contribution you know for me that
was software for this day and age you
know if you think you understand you
know Fusion uh you know that's great if
you're successful which uh that's risky
um you know you could really improve the
world you know AI is sort of the today's
equivalent of what I did when I was
young to see you know wow the
possibilities are
unlimited and so you know I'd probably
be doing uh one of these new companies
if I was starting out today is it do you
still feel there's opportunity a lot of
opportunities in AI to build something
as significant as what you have built or
it's pretty late well you know the big
companies are uh putting a lot of money
into it um and the number of companies
globally is is a you know huge I mean
you know many people didn't even know
these Chinese companies were doing all
this work and yet you know some of the
best results over the last 6 months have
come from three or four of the models
there so it's not when I got going in
Computing it was a very small set of
people and you know people thought we
were crazy that there we set a computer
on every desk and a computer in every
home and that just seemed strange to
people because they couldn't see the
they didn't get softw and they didn't
get the uh exponential Improvement of
the chips was making Computing you know
basically free so it's I'd say it's
tougher
um to get out in
front uh there will be new companies I
mean Nvidia you know is almost as
valuable as uh apple and
Microsoft and
yet uh you know they they you know came
into prominence only really in the last
five or six years although they're about
15 years old so there are opportunities
and there will be some new companies
that use
AI uh to achieve unbelievable success
but it'll be you know two or three out
of
10,000 and you know would I be able to
do that again hard to say you you talked
about like when you started a lot of
people thought that what are you doing
this is some random thing these guys are
trying to do they may be stupid they may
be thinking too big whatever right and
over the time every time you do
something big usually people do not
understand you or anyone like not just
you like whoever wants to start
something new and big in today's world
or as of today what's the biggest
misunderstanding about
you what do you think what do people
misunderstand about Bill Gates well
whenever you hear about somebody who's
got you know some degree of power or you
know ridiculous amounts of
money you know might you might think
they have grand schemes uh you know and
they're uh you know there's almost a
sense that you know their their values
are different than your values and you
know that you should be concerned about
their
agenda um you know hopefully for the
people who actually do know me um you
know and how much I love uh the
foundation work and you know how I work
with my friends or my kids uh you know
it's very different from the people who
just think oh wow you know he's one of
these guys who's you know pushing levers
and uh has has too much money and and
too much uh Authority so that people
misunderstand about you
and talking about misunderstanding do
you have you made any major mistake that
people do in
about well some of my mistakes are very
public I mean Microsoft uh you know we
had lots of products that didn't work
you know we did a a phone operating
system and now uh you know Android you
know took that position so I certainly
you know messed that up uh uh in a in a
huge way uh for the foundation you know
we often have multiple plans you know we
we wanted to have an HIV vaccine uh we
don't have that yet you know we're
working on a very cheap toilet but it's
still too expensive uh so that's taking
a lot longer we don't have polio
eradication done I'm still uh very
committed to that but it's it's taking a
lot longer uh than than we thought it
would so do talking about foundation
work you've impacted millions of life
and you spent a lot in making people's
life better what's your biggest
challenge today because some somebody on
somebody who's watching this might think
that at your level with so much power
influence money you can actually fix a
lot of problems what do you think is
your problem like what challenges do you
see
here well I love the scientific
challenges I mean we still don't fully
understand
malnutrition uh we have some tools to
reduce it that it's super exciting uh
but you know I'm really pushing our
research workers uh hard that okay you
know we need we need to know more about
that you know I do think getting money
to help the very poorest countries a lot
of which are in Africa you know Asia you
know uh many of the countries are having
good economic growth and in
Africa has a lot of
unique uh governments or instability
or disease challenges and
so telling people they should you know
help out uh other humans even though
they're they're far away and speak a
different
language that's not as easy as I thought
it would be uh you know right now some
of the rich countries including my
country are cutting their aid budgets
and I'm I'm very disappointed uh you
know to me that's not you know the
golden rule of treating people like
you'd like to be treated so what do you
think all the people who are watching
this including me uh young people should
do so that we could convince more people
to help other people well when you're
young uh if you're here in India you
know you can probably travel you know
some modest distance an hour or to and
see people you know who don't have the
same opportunities you do that you know
they're smart but their school's not
good or you know they get uh some health
problem and they're not able to access
things I would say in India you know
programs like the aspirational district
program India does uh talk openly about
the places that are the worst off and
that's you know that's pretty impressive
uh you know even issues like sanitation
that governments most governments you
know you wouldn't catch them talking
about
toilets uh you know this country you
know took on pretty aggressive plan and
made a lot of progress on that so you
can go out and
see uh people and develop empathy uh
without going too
far and you
spent hours and hours and days in this
country you spent Millions on vaccines
and trying to take care of healthare
challenges what's one problem you feel
that money not
fix
H you know there's a lot of talk about
uh
obesity and uh you know when I saw the
Prime Minister he was talking about
various yoga type things that you know
if people would adopt those but it's
been hard you know not many countries
have gotten the behavior change you know
maybe India can Pioneer some approaches
there but you know frankly and I'll
sound like a technologist the most
promising thing is actually uh a you
know a drug a class of drugs called
these glp1 drugs that you know are going
to go off patent and become cheap and
you know so I always like a you know I'm
a little overfocused on a a scientific
solution so maybe a combination of that
behavior change and and the new tools
but Behavior change is hard um we we
haven't uh succeeded in that as as much
as we'd like to that me one Behavior we
all should
adopt well you know the behavior that's
helped me is is basically being a
student all the time wanting to learn
things and being pretty brutal with
myself of do I really understand you
know what's going on you know do I
understand some AI thing or uh some
disease thing and you know
fortunately uh I can meet with people
people who in many cases can help me
understand and then you know knowledge
if you're careful about building your
your knowledge it all kind of connects
together but uh you know reading a lot
being a student you know having people
who can teach me uh uh that's you know
been not only fun for me but also a big
part of My
Success so all of people who are
watching this actually feels pretty
validated dated at this point good
because this whole podcast is about
learning from really really incredible
people like you and we have so many
questions that we just keep asking to
learn more to learn more to get inside
brains so thanks for
validation
perfect what's fascinating for me this
time in your journey like this time your
visit to India the full Gates Foundation
board is your right and that's pretty
unique and they get to experience
India what what do you think what are
your
priorities with regards to this nation
why the whole board is here what do you
guys are trying to figure out what are
the things that you're doing well as
much progress as we've been part of
achieving here in India there's still a
lot to do uh you know the the child to
death rate is about a third of what it
was um but it's still
almost three times higher than in a rich
country uh so we you know we should all
want to close that Gap uh that's uh
Equity uh I mentioned
malnutrition uh you know the country is
very serious about that and yet um you
know it means that your brain never
develops and sadly if whatever dietary
or disease things affect you uh during
pregn pregnancy in your first year even
if later you get a fantastic diet your
brain and your physical uh capabilities
they don't adjust you're you know sort
of permanently affected and so um you
know we're working with some great
scientists here we have a lot of the
tools of biology have gotten a lot
better so I do think um you know in the
next decade we'll totally get to the
bottom of that uh and you know I'm I'm
thrilled to do that and a lot of
the scientists we partner with you know
including some at icmr but you know lots
of Institutions around the country uh
they're also uh committed to that so you
work here a lot and with the foundation
you work around the world a lot of
things and because of all of this
passion and data and this intention to
try to help people you've been pretty
accurate in trying to understand Trends
way before people like a normal people
let's say you were pretty accurate in so
many things in
predicting so many epidemics as well is
there something that you know which we
don't like how do you spot these things
way faster well the biggest change agent
in my lifetime has been the the miracle
of digital you know now uh moving into
the AI phase of of that digital
Revolution so the fact that as a young
person you know I was programming at age
13 and by you know 18 I had my you know
thousands of hours of uh really strong
feedback about you know getting better
and uh being pushed uh and so to it's a
really lucky thing to have such a
familiarity with the thing that's going
to change the world and so you know I
wrote a book called the road ahead a
long time ago you know that talked about
uh you know the internet and digital
money and uh video
conferencing and then when I moved into
the foundation work the health work you
know people in that Community understand
pandemics and you know so my saying hey
you know there's a big risk and the
thing that's going to K you know 10
million additional people is likely to
be a
pandemic uh you know that's commonplace
knowledge if you're in the global Health
Community it's a very small community uh
but I was just somebody who was listened
to uh uh
stating uh this and sadly you know most
the people who listen to that prediction
uh listen to it after it came true then
you know what my goal was was people to
hear the that and actually uh stop it
from happening that's usually the case
right like people listen
to Pieces golden edwise pieces and
pieces of nuggets way after the time has
been passed right because of this do you
fear anything today I definitely hope
that we shape
AI in a positive way it's such a big uh
impact on you know
being smarter than humans uh that it
will change our world a lot um and it's
you know it's it's definitely new
territory so I have a list of about five
things you know AI shaping AI properly
is at the top of that list but you know
avoiding the next pandemic avoiding
nuclear war uh biot terrorism climate
change it's only about five or six
things that we need
to um minimize
the chance of um you know and use our
additional wealth and insights you know
against those things do you have any
personal fear what's your biggest fear
you know it's not like I'm afraid of
heights or planes or fire or anything
like that you know I hope I'm I'll be
sad as my
brain uh gets less capable you know
which you know I'm as I turned 70 this
year you know I'd be lucky to have 20
years of you know being able to learn uh
you know maybe I'll get lucky and get a
little bit more but you know that
disappoints me because I've had such a
amazing time learning uh things and I I
used to think of old people as not you
know contributing all that much and now
I've had to change my mind about how how
important old people are uh do you do
you feel difference I don't I don't all
uh you know probably if I I took an IQ
test I I would do a little bit worse
than when I was
25 uh but you know I've accumulated
enough knowledge you know so
wisdom uh you know can compensate a
little bit for a slight uh reduction
intelligence and I do think it's like a
muscle that if you're pushing yourself
to think and learn that you know you
stay uh it really helps your capability
a lot um but yeah I have a fear that you
know I eventually I'll lose you know I
won't want to pick up a 500 page book
I'll look at it and go are you kidding
uh I'm done with
that so with age you have not felt any
changes in your brain not really in
terms of
um wow no I don't think so um you know
whenever you can't remember something
you're like oh no now but uh
uh you know so maybe a tiny bit of that
but then you know it's just a little bit
because you're you're looking for it you
know when I was in my 20s if I could
remember something I I was like so what
uh uh so is there any change you feel
because so Bill Gates of 25 and Bill
Gates of 70 is there any change that you
feel personally well in my 20s I was I
chose to focus on one topic from you
know 20 to about
31 or two
um I told myself hey I love biology and
math and all these things but I want to
be the person who's advancing software
faster than anyone else and so I really
did narrow my focus and I I didn't you
know take much time off and I could stay
in the office you know 72 hours and then
crash um and so my
adrenaline and was really unique now my
understanding of how to manage people uh
other than myself wasn't that that could
you know i' I I look back
and you know I've learned a lot since
then but just my
stamina uh and focus for that period of
my life you know being kind of kind of a
a
maniac uh was was the right thing and
you know I I you know my competitors
would say oh no you work too hard and
I'd say yes I do uh do you think that's
a great advice for every young person
who's watching maniac in your 20s it's
not it's not for everyone um but if
you're if you're in a
race uh
and you know the a little bit moving a
little bit faster can make a a
difference uh then yes your your 20s
when you have no wife and no children uh
that's the time to do it uh that's the
time to be little maniac about certain
things right you also just mentioned
that you love learning which obviously
the world knows but during this
conversation also you just talked about
it like a little bit again again what
are you currently learning or what do
you want to learn now well there's a lot
going
on uh you know AI just staying on top of
that is you know I I very much enjoy
that and I get to sit and talk with the
top people at open Ai and I get to play
around with things but then when you
think okay now about what about AI
applied to Mental Health Care uh you
know isn't that one of the most exciting
things because you know we can never
have enough
therapists uh and even people who
aren't uh you know suffering massively
you know maybe we could help uh
even people with mild uh symptoms so you
know what does this AI companion look
like and you know how can
that help us uh my friend Reed Hoffman
uh just wrote a book called Super agency
that he's got a really good about this
so I'm pushing myself to try and
understand uh you know what can we do
there and meet the people who are you
know pushing the the boundaries uh
because I see such potential so what
would you advise young people to start
learning today and from where AI itself
well if you have a mathematical mind you
know not everyone should learn AI uh you
know these tools are going to be
available uh to everyone and so you
ought to be a user of AI but the
underlying stuff you know that's a
pretty narrow set of people who will
have an opportunity to uh you know push
on a new Training Method um and even
people who grew up with software some of
them don't really get this because it's
it's a bit more mathematical than it is
just a a Programming type thing
so it's as a user that okay if you you
like doing creative work
yes AI is going to change your world and
AI hopefully can help you uh do things
faster and better so my prescription
would be yes to use it for the areas
that you're excited about any area that
you're excited about learn from learn
about that and try to make a bridge
between Ai and that industry right I
mean the internet has so much
educational material on it so between
all that material uh and then an AI that
can help you know take long documents
and you can have a dialogue with it uh
you know you can do it in text or you
can you know now do these generate
podcasts about things it's uh it's a
great time to be a learner right you
know when I was young I had to go to the
library and you know read the
encyclopedia alphabetically uh no
multimedia uh this is a a paradise yeah
thanks to you guys because you digal
world Digital World you made it easy for
us we don't know the world what it look
like to go to library and read about
something we get fidgety if we don't get
an answer in 3
seconds okay I have last two questions
for you okay one is in your philanthropy
work with the foundation how is in India
contributing to your Global strategies
well more and more of the
Innovation um is been done in India uh
India's you know got a depth of talent
and a desire for Frugal Solutions and so
even though the rich World us Europe you
know we have a lot of talent and for
some basic science thing like Immunology
a lot of the new insights will keep
coming uh from those in institutions but
when it comes to actually putting the
pieces together including something like
AI for healthcare you know I was just
meeting with a number of companies
working on on very piece various pieces
of that in India uh and so the you know
we need better seeds and we need better
weather advice for farmers and so
although we're going to continue to do a
lot of implementation here in India help
you know get things rolled out uh more
and more of our sort of product research
uh work will be done here okay uh both
because um it benefits India but you
know we're also very good if if it's
saving Indian children really working
well you know our foundation has a lot
of presence in Africa so even take you
know the classic example where India was
totally the leader on this digital
public infrastructure the the digital
money an identity adhar thing uh you
know funding the Africans to come here
and learn and uh for their budgets and
create helping to create the open source
software that makes it easy for them you
know that's now a huge agenda item which
is kind of a South South thing with a
little bit of facilitation from us got
it and here's the last question
uh if you had if the world had to write
one sentence
next to the name Bill Gates what would
you want them to write you know I don't
do my work you know based on some epith
uh you know ideally you know they'd say
that wow there were these diseases
around you know polio and malaria and uh
malnutrition and you know now we don't
have to think about that you know partly
because uh he championed you know
putting more
uh great thinking and resources into
ending those problems and so you know I
hope people look at the word polio and
go what was that uh you know when you
read dickens's novels and they talk
about somebody had consumption it's like
what is that well that's actually TB so
we still not in the UK we don't have
much but we we we still do they just uh
change the word so you know hopefully uh
some problems that that we can actually
finish uh and and then move on which
problem do you think we'll be finishing
well polio uh you know I I expect even
in five years uh and that'll give us uh
The credibility to go after things like
malarian measles that's amazing oh it is
it's going to be fun uh it's it's
amazing in five years we can make that a
reality it's going to be incredible for
the humankind it's wow yeah it's only
happened only once small poox was
eliminated back in 1980 so you know
polio of serious disease it's going to
be the
second wow I really truly wish that it
happens faster than what we just talked
about and I hope like more than by the
time the foundation gets in full-fledged
in the work I I believe instead of not
two three there could be multiple of
them so that you you lost counting that
should be the goal and I'm expecting for
it well thank you so much for doing this
