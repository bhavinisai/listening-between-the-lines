back in what 2008 2009 I remember my
parents being like you can't make money
playing games this is so pointless and
then to see this
>> scene just explode to what it is now
>> I've seen you doing podcasts with Jimmy
a few others guys us doing this like I
wanted to come here I think this is a
sick thing for
So, I had a massive cancellation around
a year ago. Uh, and I feel I'm a
different human and now I appreciate it.
Has that happened with you?
>> I mean, where do you want to start? I
[laughter]
I've always said this. The only person
that can cancel [music] you is you?
>> Does a bad breakup hurt more or does
hurt?
>> I'd say a bad breakup. Just depression
on a whole different level
>> of boy hours. What [laughter]
>> who do you think's winning the sale?
>> I think it's between three teams.
[music] England, Spain, France.
>> Do you have like footballer friends?
>> I think Harland is actually crazy. At
such a young age, he was so locked in.
>> One of my wildest life moments was
podcasting with Reopened, man.
>> Yeah, I saw that. Yeah.
>> What advice do you give to someone like
Speed?
Are the Sideman guys your best bros?
[music] Yeah, I'd say they're good.
>> Are you allowed to talk about that
closed door meeting that happened?
>> Oh,
where have you heard that from? I'd say
not everyone has the same goal.
>> Simple.
>> It's not simple.
>> Did you ever speak to Logan and or Jake
about
>> I don't talk to Jake. Me and Jake don't
get on.
>> Dude, I can't imagine you not getting
along with anyone
>> really.
>> Yeah. I wouldn't mind going to jail with
you.
>> Okay. If if you and me both go to jail
together, I think we'd have a good time.
>> Oh, well, we could [music] just be bros
outside of jail. YEAH. YEAH. [laughter]
>> WE COULD JUST do that. [music]
>> Think of all the YouTubers that the
world has ever seen. And then there'll
be like this little top rung, the top 1%
of YouTubers who've achieved the most in
the real world, beginning their journeys
from the world of YouTube. KSI is in
that top 1%. In fact, he's one of the
most iconic names in that top 1%. I'm
saying this because I've followed KSI's
journey for a long time. There's lots of
Indian fans who followed KSI's journey
for a long time. And the reason I'm
doing this intro is for those few fans
globally who are not familiar with KSI's
work until this point. I believe he's
going to keep growing very ferociously
in the world of content. But I believe
even more so that this guy is a
phenomenal human being. It's just a lot
of fun being around him. This episode
contains a lot of that fun, a lot of
that energy that chases greatness and it
was just a great hangout sesh. It's KSI
on TRS.
[music]
[music]
>> [music]
>> I was going to call you Yoruba King at
the start of this episode, [laughter]
but
>> I mean, I don't know if I deserve that
title just yet. Anyway, [laughter]
>> excited about going to Nigeria for the
first time.
>> Yes, I it's been a long time coming. Um,
yeah, it's um just life. It's crazy.
like there's always things that get in
the way of uh what matters to me. So,
finally I'm I'm able to like make things
what do the things that I've always
wanted to do and I'm feeling real good
with how I'm moving this year
especially. I think it all started last
year. No, I'd say it started from Tommy
Fury fight after I lost that fight. I
was definitely quite a bit lost. And
then over a few months, years, I was
like, "All right, let me try and get
back into the boxing." But my heart
wasn't really in it. And it didn't work
out. And eventually, I just got to a
point where I was getting ready to fight
Dylan Dannis.
My hand was up.
I felt like I like physically my
body was broken. I was like, why am I
doing this to myself?
Why am I putting myself through hell
when there's something I I purely enjoy,
something I enjoy so much more, and
that's making content. And
>> at that point, I was like, "All right,
I'm going to make a change." So, after
the Dylan fight didn't happen, I said,
"All right, cool. I'm going to work on
my channel, work on my YouTube channel."
And it's been a process especially, you
know, the first six, seven months to try
and get it to a level I'm where I'm
happy at. And now it's like, all right,
cool. I'm here, you know, let's start.
Let's properly start. So, I've been
making some good content. Um, obviously,
you know, India has been so amazing for
me throughout the years and I felt like,
you know, it's a great place to start
for making content. I didn't want to go
Nigeria straight off because I was like
I know I know everyone say like you're
Nigerian makes sense.
>> You've been to India twice.
>> I've been in it three times but I've
never been Nigeria which is so bad. You
know I blame my parents. My parents have
told me that Nigeria is an awful place.
>> Oh really?
>> Yeah.
>> Is that true though?
>> So the last time they went was like 30
40 years ago. But you know from the
stories they've told me Nigeria hasn't
been very nice to them. you know, from
kidnapping to, you know, robbery to all
the worst things you could think of.
Like it, you know, they've been scarred
and, you know, even the most recent
event that happened with Anthony Joshua.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
>> You know, like stuff like that scares
them. They see that and they go, "Oh
man, like do you really want to go back
there?" And I'm like, it's important,
you know, I need to, you know, show the
world that I need to show me that, you
know, it's great. It's fine. Like all
their stories, yes, maybe it happened
back back then, but like things have
changed. Nigeria isn't the same, you
know, place like it was back in the day.
And, you know, it's a a lovely place to
visit.
>> It's like one of my dream travel
destinations. West West Africa in
general, like I want to go to Nigeria,
Ghana, Benin. So, I've been Ghana. I
haven't been Nigerian, which again, but
like
>> shame when you
>> I know it's bad. It's No, no, I know
it's super bad, but I think for me it's
like,
>> you know, when I do go Nigeria, it's
going to be special. It's going to be a
big moment. And we're looking to do it
after the World Cup to really like
>> nice
>> just find time for it. You making sure I
have time in the calendar to make it one
of the best times for me and my bro. I'm
going to bring my bro as well and it's
just going to be great.
>> I got to say some to you.
>> Hit me.
>> H I love how open your heart is, man.
>> Okay. [laughter]
>> You're like a really open guy.
>> I I mean I I feel like I've always I
mean it's definitely helped in my
career.
>> You've got some serious fandom in India
especially.
>> Yeah.
>> I I think a lot of Indian guys recognize
openness in another dude.
>> Yeah. I feel like you can tell when
people are fake.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. And I'm I'm myself and I've always
been myself and yeah, sometimes it's
been to my detriment. [laughter]
>> No, no.
>> But it's also also, you know, it I guess
it makes me more human and it makes it
more, you know, you're able to
>> empathize and bond more with someone
that is happy to open themselves.
>> It's resilience, baby. CDL energy.
[laughter]
>> Yeah,
>> I did just go on there. I'm sorry.
>> No, that's fine. That's all good.
>> You've got a beautiful voice. I can hear
[laughter] the voice over there.
>> Oh, you've got like one of the most
successor oriented arcs that any content
creator in the world's ever seen, man.
>> Yeah.
>> Are you happy with this success arc?
>> Oh, of course. Oh, no, no, no. Of
course. So happy with everything that
I've done, everything I've created from,
you know, I never thought we'd be in
this position. you know, you know, my
me, my friends, my family, you know,
like it's crazy what you where YouTube
has come from or where YouTube is at
right now.
>> I remember when I was making YouTube
content back in what, 2008, 2009,
and I was like, "This is fun. I'm having
the best time."
>> Slavery Fever.
>> Well, yeah. No, no, not even then. this
I didn't even do like I was just playing
uh playing games. I didn't even you
didn't hear my voice. You didn't uh see
my face. It was just me doing FIFA
skills and that was it. And I posted
that and I did compilations and montages
and it was just simple. Like there was
nothing else to it. And I remember my
parents being like, I don't know why you
spend so much time doing this. You can't
make money playing games. This is so
pointless. Like you're wasting your
time. we should be studying education,
this that and then to see this scene
just explode to what it is now where
thousands, hundreds of thousands of if
not millions of people are able to have
a career because of it's just fantastic.
Whether it's long form, short form,
podcasts, anything. It's just sick.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Um why did you not enjoy boxing as much?
Because from the outside looking in, it
seems like everyone was enjoying boxing.
Yeah, you know, you the only way to
really understand is to try it.
>> I used to do I used to do martial arts,
judo,
>> and I I that was the one aspect of my
martial arts I didn't enjoy because I'm
a very peaceful, loving guy. I can't
beat another person.
>> I'd say
the training,
how physically and mentally draining it
is, it's just like nothing else. I'd say
of everything I've done in my life, that
is the hardest thing. The hardest thing
>> really
>> think about it. You've got 12 week camp.
You've got a fight day and you're there
like, "All right, cool. Let me start. I
feel good. I feel pumped. I'm ready."
First day, you know, you train, you feel
good. You're like, "Oh, wow. That that
was great." And then train again. So,
I'm training twice a day. So, I'm
training twice and I'm like, "Okay, I
still feel good." Second day, train
twice a day. I'm like, "Wow, I feel
great." This happens over and over again
for about a week. end of the week, I'm
like, "Oh man, I feel really good.
There's no problems, anything."
You know, sparring went well. You know,
maybe I was a little tired. Stamina was
a bit, you know, wasn't up to standard,
but I'm there. Next week, you do it
again. This time
you're getting up, not so easily. you
know, your back hurts, your legs hurt a
bit more, and you're there like, "Okay,
this is a little bit harder than it was
last week. Sparring not doing as well.
You know, the stamina, the fitness is
really starting to get to you." Third
week,
you're looking, you're waking up and
you're like, "Oh, man. Okay, I got to do
this again." Then you look at the fight
day and you go, I got several weeks of
this and I'm already feeling it. Bro, by
the seventh, eighth week, you're like,
why am I doing this?
>> I hate this. This is horrible. I'm
getting beat up, you know?
I I I don't even want to get up anymore.
I feel ill. Like my body is starting to
shut down because you're just feeling
sick, ill. But you just have to fight
through it. every day the same thing
over and over and over again. And then
think of it, that's physically,
mentally, you're just there cooked
>> because of the discipline,
>> just having to do it over and over and
over again.
>> And bro, I haven't even mentioned the
food, the food, the type of food you
have to eat, bro. Like, it's the same
thing over regimented like just chicken,
rice, no spice, nothing. Just chicken,
rice, bland. and you're yearning for
like some sweets or some
um just something that just to spice up
your life and it's just that all the
time, you know, fish and potatoes,
that's it. Like fish and potatoes,
chicken and rice, that's it. Back and
forth over and over and over and over
again and that's all you're having. And
then
it just it's like mentally, physically,
you're just finished. breaks you and
then you still have to
>> have that energy to want to fight.
>> And then when you get there, it's like,
"All right, cool. I'm at the fight. Oh
no, why why am I nervous? Oh my god,
there's so many people around.
So many people depending on me. I got
people betting on me." Yeah. [laughter]
Like I got people telling me
[clears throat] that they're betting on
me, being like, "Bro, I bet on 10k. Like
I really need you to win this." and all
of that and all the pressure getting
heavier and heavier and heavier and
heavier and then you have to walk out.
Even if your legs are jelly, you have to
walk out, face your opponent, you know,
and then fight them. Yes, you win. It's
fantastic. Best feeling ever. You
thoric. You're over the moon. You lose,
bro.
What a waste of my time. What a waste. I
literally spent 12 weeks of my life
killing myself to not get the result
that I wanted.
>> Did you ever think of a moment like that
Anthony Joshua punch on Jake Paul's jaw?
Like do you ever think of injuries being
a possibility during a match?
>> You you think of everything. You think
it's the idea of I'm in this ring with
someone who's trying to knock me out. I
don't want to get knocked out. I don't
want to become a meme. Like I remember
the fight I had with Joel. It was the
most important fight of my life. If I
lost that fight, well, I don't think AJ
would have fought Jake Paul. I don't
think Jake Paul would be fighting. He
wouldn't It wouldn't be a thing. Logan
wouldn't be fighting. It wouldn't none
of this would have happened. Like
because I beat Joella and I loved it and
I enjoyed the feeling it gave me. Like
it was hard. Like I before I didn't even
know how to run. I had to download an
app called five uh couch to 5k to learn
how to run.
>> So it's where you have to walk then jog
for a little bit then walk jog for a
little bit and then eventually get to a
point where you can just jog without
stopping for 5k. So, you know, it's it's
just crazy to think that yes, I could
have fought this guy called Joela lost
and none of this influenced boxing scene
would have happened, but because I won,
called out the poor brothers,
the rest is history.
Uh, did you ever speak to Logan and or
Jake about what boxing gave you guys in
the long term?
>> I don't talk to Jake. Me and Jake don't
get on. Um, but with Logan.
>> Yeah, we talk.
>> Dude, I can't imagine you not getting
along with anyone
>> really.
>> Yeah. I feel like you're a very
whatever. We've had some feuds and all
that.
>> Yeah. Yeah, of course.
>> We see your evolution as well. You seem
like one of the most like like I'd want
to party with you or like vacation with
you.
>> Yeah, I'd say. Yeah, it's it takes a lot
to be on my bad side.
>> Do you have a bad side?
>> I think everyone has a bad side, but
like it's whether you want to tap into
that. And I don't for me I don't want to
do that. I felt like I had to when I was
boxing. I felt like I had to be the
nightmare.
And with that, to sell a fight, you have
to be you have to do stuff to get people
to want to watch. You have to find ways
to get to bring that emotion out of
people. And you know, I did some
horrible things
when I was
doing the whole boxing thing. But you
had that's just how that's the fight
game. And I didn't enjoy it. didn't like
it.
>> You feel like you've gained anything
from the fighting phase other than like
the material stuff?
>> I think
I mean I didn't even gain much from the
material stuff. My fight with Tommy
Fury, all the money I made, I gave it to
my trainers. All of it. I was just like
I don't I for me it's not I don't do
stuff for this. I've been offered
20 million to fight Jake Paul, 30
million to fight Jake Paul.
people. These guys can't give me any
amount of money to fight this guy. When
it comes to boxing, I'm done. I tried.
My main goal when I got into the boxing
um ring again was to fight Jake Paul
and Bill Misfits.
Built Misfits
tried to fight Jake Paul time and time
and time again. He just excuse after
excuse after excuse.
Instead of Tommy Fury, I was there ready
to fight Jake Paul. I was ready. I was
there. Let's go. And instead, he fought
Nate Diaz.
>> And at that point, I had to fight Tommy
Fury. At that point, I was like, you
know what? I think I tried to build up
again to then try and fight Jake again.
And then he was just getting heavier and
heavier and heavier trying to move the
goalpost when it comes to weight. Then
it got to the point where I was like,
"What am I doing, man? I'm done.
>> How do you feel about money now at this
stage of life?
>> I mean,
for me, money doesn't really drive
anything for me. I'm at a point where
I've made it. I've made it in life. I've
smashed it. You know, I've been, you
know, at the top of my career for a
very, very long time. And it's hard,
especially in this space that changes so
quickly to stay, you know, on top. It's
it's not easy. But for me, it's all
about giving,
>> just giving back as much as I can. And
you know, whenever I can help out, I'm
always going to help out. I don't know.
I I'm just there like I want I want to
do more, but I can't because of this
boxing thing. And now I can. Now I'm
able to really do all the things that
I've always wanted to do.
>> Yeah. Dude, I think content creation
generally is a really tough career to
learn, but once you've learned it, it's
all about rhythm.
>> Yes.
>> And and then the rhythm is like really
enjoyable after a point.
>> Exactly. Yeah.
>> I think that's what you're chasing as
well.
>> I'm getting I'm getting the rhythm. I'm
getting there now.
>> Yeah. Like this this guy uh he's like a
lifelong fan. He's like 20 21.
>> Okay.
>> And I spent like 2 hours with him. We
worked together
>> but for the last 2 hours we've just been
talking about you.
>> Oh wow. [laughter]
>> What the best thing about me and then
you could say the worst as well.
>> Yeah. I mean and he's watched you for
years.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Because I always find it
intriguing to see what
>> I think the best thing about you is the
comeback that you make every now and
then. Like when you know things are
going down bad for you,
>> you've have that mentality to just
strike back. try.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
>> So, I think that is the best thing about
you.
>> Yeah. I think I think
>> What about worst? [laughter]
>> I'm not going to let you go with
>> maybe the cancelable things.
>> Yeah.
>> We get we get cancelceled a lot as well.
>> No, no, no. But I definitely but with
with that I think it's quite good
because you know I know I have a lot of
people that look up to me but yeah I've
made so many mistakes but I think it's
good that you know it's people can see
the mistakes I make.
>> It's relatable because then you're like
oh okay if I made the mistake and then
kept making them
>> then that's a problem. That's terrible.
But I think with me, I make a mistake
and I learn from it. And then I try to
show that to my audience as well. Like
you have to learn from what you want,
you know, from the mistakes that you
make. So
>> I feel like cloning Chris and making a
bunch of Chris's hug you to give you
like love right now.
>> God's sake. [laughter]
>> I don't know. I just had to say that,
bro.
>> No, it's all good. It's all good.
>> I want to take like a tiny tangent.
>> Okay, go for it.
>> I'm really liking just sitting with you
in this one, bro. [laughter]
Sick.
>> It's a great It's a great one. Likewise.
Likewise.
>> You got some great energy.
>> Thank you.
>> I I honestly truly believe in energy.
>> Oh yeah, bro.
>> Yeah. I feel like you can you can tell
when there's good energy and when
there's bad energy and like
I I I just truly believe like if you
surround yourself with good energy, life
becomes beautiful.
>> You attract more of it,
>> right? So, I had a massive cancellation
around a year ago.
>> Okay.
>> Uh like pretty bad.
>> Okay.
>> Uh and I feel I'm a different human and
now I appreciate it.
>> Has that happened with you where you
appreciate a cancellation from the past?
>> Well, I mean, where do you want to
start? [laughter]
How many cancellations have I had? Oh,
brother.
I've been I've been around for a while,
so I've [laughter] been cancelled quite
a few times. Yeah,
>> but I always I've always said this. The
only person that can cancel you is you.
>> Yeah.
>> Is yourself. You like you can let it all
get to you and then you can just go I'm
done.
>> Yeah.
>> And that's it.
>> There's like
>> you you've canceled yourself
essentially.
>> Yeah. There's this quote that goes uh
until death all forms of defeat are
psychological.
>> Okay.
>> Samurai mentality.
>> I think that's what it takes to stay in
content for really long.
>> Yes. Uh, and it's not an easy career to
like sustain in the long
>> No.
>> Do you have like footballer friends?
>> I mean,
>> have you got great advice from any
footballer?
>> I think Harland
um when I talked to him, he he's it's
actually crazy at such a young age, he
was so locked in so early and I, you
know, I was quite jealous of that. Like
I wish I had that lock in when I was his
age. And for him it's like I think
that's that is important just to stay
focused. Imagine all your life was just
up up up. You never appreciate anything.
You got to have some downs. And bro, the
amount of downs I've had, it made me
really appreciate the ups and made me
really appreciate, you know, what I have
and what I had. And then you go, okay,
cool. Let's work myself up again. Does a
bad breakup hurt more or does
cancellation hurt?
>> I'd say a bad breakup
>> more more than
>> Yeah. Yeah. I don't I think heartbreak
is probably one of the worst things,
>> right? Like way more than being
canceled, even on like a really bad
level. [laughter] I I think with a
heartbreak, it's just
I don't know this it's you I don't know
how to explain it, but it's just
depression
at a whole different level. You imagine
this person you're going to be with for
the rest of your life and then they're
not there anymore and they're gone and
that's it and there's nothing you can do
about it. That is awful. Horrible
feeling, man. But then, you know, it
takes a while to get over that. And, you
know, some some people never really get
over it. They always wonder like what
if.
With a cancellation, it's kind of just
like you made a mistake, you learn from
it, and then you don't make that mistake
again. And then you just keep on making
content. You just keep going and keep
That's it. You just have to keep going.
>> Yeah. Content doesn't heal breakups.
>> No, no, no, no, no. Not at all.
>> Soft boy hours.
>> What? [laughter]
No, I I I definitely uh you definitely
[laughter]
doesn't
>> soft JJ.
>> But I definitely um I respect a lot of
people who have public relationships.
>> Oh yeah.
>> No chance. Like I've been with my girl
for 8 years.
>> Yeah.
>> Well, you are just nah, man. Like the
idea of people knowing everything about
her and then people commenting on on
your relationship, saying whatever.
Like, bro, you see what even on X, like
uh Grock the AI, bro, you seeing some
crazy stuff where people are just
wearing normal clothes and people are
like, "Oh, Grock, show this person in a
bikini and all of that." And I'm just
they're like, it's just so intrusive.
But obviously, you know, it's the
internet. It's gonna do its thing. You
can't fight it. But I think it's nice
that, you know, there's a little part of
me that's super special that I don't
have to give to the world.
>> I keep trying to explain the same thing
to my partner.
>> Yeah.
>> She doesn't fully understand.
>> Yeah. No, trust me.
>> But it's it's like a very guyto guy
conversation thing.
>> Yeah. It's re it's
way better way better private because
it's just it's so nice being able to go
out in public with your loved one and
not have to worry about them just, you
know, taking photos here, the photos
there, da da da, or just commenting.
Like, it's just it's the worst thing,
man. It's just nice to just be free with
this person. just be able to relax and
chill and not just talk about your
career or your job all the time.
>> Do you get to be anonymous anywhere?
>> Um, it's hard. It's very hard. Um,
not really. Not really.
>> Does it feel like a little bit like
choking? Do you feel
>> No, I think the only place I can be
anonymous is at home [laughter]
in my house. But like I like being at
home, you know, when I'm with my misses
and, you know, especially when we just
do fun things like make pizzas together
or we play video games together.
>> It takes two.
>> It takes two. Yeah, we we smash through
that. Uh we played Unraveled or Unra Oh,
is it Unraveled? You know, the strings.
>> Oh my god, that's a great game as well.
>> It's like a two-player thing.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really?
>> Well, anything co-op uh offline games,
>> we're going ham on it. We're We're
currently playing Portal 2. Oh,
>> you know the two people in prison,
what's that one? There's a one called
The Last Ride or the Not Last of Us.
>> It's something. But again, we completed
it. Like, we just we play all types of
games when it comes to co-op.
>> What do you do when you're completely
alone, man?
>> I'm completely alone. Oh, man. Honestly,
I just stare at YouTube stats.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. just look at and
just or just like ways to improve my
YouTube videos. Um play Dragon Ball
Legends um just on my phone. Uh you
know, watch anime um watch certain some
series on like Netflix, Amazon Prime.
>> You feel like Dragon Ball Z kind of
affected your adult mind?
>> Yes.
>> I keep I keep going back to that
thought. I it's literally like shaped my
childhood and then I've just grown up
with it. Just that never give up
mentality. And that's why it's it's
quite interesting that you mentioned
that like whenever I'm down, I'm always
find a way to, you know, get back up
again.
>> I just find a sense of being [laughter]
and I'm back.
>> Feel like you you enjoy pain a LITTLE
BIT, MAN.
>> WHAT? [laughter]
WHAT? WAIT, WHERE YOU going with this?
>> Every Dragon Ball fan enjoys pain.
I mean I mean I've definitely
experienced all types of pain.
[laughter]
Uh not not really. I don't think anyone
enjoys pain. I don't think I'm not like
what what do you call people who like
obsessed with pain?
>> A massochistic something like that.
Yeah. Like I'm not I'm not there like oh
where can I find that bit of pain? I
know I'm feeling for [laughter] it. No
I'm just like you know if it happens it
happens and then you just move on. Yeah.
>> So, have you heard of the Amani wedding?
It was this big wedding that you know
about it?
>> Yes, of course.
>> Uh, so I was at the Amani wedding and I
met John Cena at the Amani wedding.
>> Wow.
>> And so, I spent about 20 to 30 minutes
talking to him.
>> That's incredible.
>> And he said something that I think he
told Kaisat as well.
>> He said that the most important thing in
life for him is to just be useful every
day. That's the purpose of life
according to John Cena.
>> That's interesting.
>> Yeah. And over this last one year,
that's where my ball lands as well.
>> Like I feel like Yeah, that that's
right. That's how like
>> just be useful like depending on the
person you're with or whatever it is.
>> Yeah. Just be be of use to people, the
world, your work, your teammates, all
that.
>> That's quite it's quite good.
>> How how far ahead do you visualize
career or life or whatever?
>> How far ahead? Well, I you know, I see
me doing content probably for the rest
of my life, you know, even when I'm like
70, 80, I think. Yeah. I mean, I don't
know what the content's going to be.
[laughter]
I'm still doing try not to laugh or
or I'm there doing a vlog like, all
right, I'm finally in Nigeria.
[laughter]
We did it, boys and girls.
Like, for me, I just I love it. I just
love making content, man. It's just like
I think even if I had no money, no fame,
whatever, I'd always still be making
content. And I mean, I I did I did I
didn't have money at the beginning. I
didn't have fame and I just make
content. So, it's I've always just loved
it. Like, it's just been a thing.
>> How was life before content
>> for me? Um, I mean I was definitely I
was just like a introverted kid uh who
would just play games, you know, with
school I was just like it's whatever
like you know I'm just doing it. But
like then when I got back home to play
like Call of Duty 4, oh my god, the
excitement and then being able
especially during like the summer break
just playing Call of Duty 4 over and
every single day with my mates and then
just going online and seeing people play
games and record themselves doing I was
there like, "Oh my god, this is this is
the dream. I'd love to do this." And
then eventually I made it happen. And
obviously, you know, I've already talked
about this, but yeah, I just, you know,
I when it came to school, I wasn't
really like didn't really speak to me.
But I think nowadays you you can kind of
tell like not everyone is super
academic. You know there's other jobs
you know you got people who are very
good at sports you good you got people
who are very good at making content you
know good at good people people who just
great at talking like you know us doing
this like I wanted to come here I think
this is a huge you know sick sick thing
for us.
>> I'm glad. No. Yeah. Ram here, bro. Like,
like I've seen you doing podcasts with
um Jimmy, a few others guys, and I'm
just there like, you know, why am I not
able to do this? And like people who are
great at just all types of stuff. And
now, you know, we live in a world where
you can make a job with anything.
I totally agree with what you're saying,
>> but I also feel like the world is
progressively becoming sadder and that's
why you need more jokes and talking
in the world.
>> Um,
I think I think a lot of people are just
putting out their frustrations, their
anger because, you know, life's tough
and, you know, sometimes the only way to
get it out is, you know, online
anonymously.
>> Yeah. And you know, look, with the
internet, it's
it's crazy. We we use the internet back
in the day as a way to
connect people, but now sometimes you
feel like the internet is
making things a lot more lonely.
>> And
>> the next time you feel lonely, we've
always got Chris.
>> No, no, [laughter]
I know he's here all the time, bro.
reason.
>> But no, but it's
>> there's so much imagery I'm getting in
my head about Chris and you, bro.
[laughter]
>> Oh gosh.
We're going to be making fan dramas of
us. [laughter]
>> I don't even know why I'm doing this to
you.
>> No, no, it's fine.
>> You think we'll get cancelled after this
episode?
>> Uh, no. I I think I think we've been
pretty chill. I mean, I don't think
there's anything that could be Honestly,
these days it's hard to tell, man.
[laughter]
And then you learn and then you keep on
pushing. [laughter]
>> Yeah, dude. You know, I wouldn't mind
going to jail with you,
>> okay?
>> If if you and me both go to jail
together, I think we'd have a good time.
We play football and like [laughter]
>> we could just be bros OUTSIDE THE JAIL.
YOU KNOW THAT. YOU know that
>> we could just do that.
>> I feel like I'm going to travel to
Nigeria with you at some point.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
>> When are you planning on going? So after
the World Cup,
>> like July, August,
>> I think it's probably around August.
Yeah.
>> August, September.
>> Who do you think's winning this year?
>> What? The World Cup?
>> Yeah.
>> Oh, man.
>> I think it's between three teams.
>> England,
Spain, France.
>> France.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. I think
>> there's there's no fourth team that's
even near these three in terms of
quality. I mean I mean I mean you might
have Ronaldo fanboys or Messi fanboys
who go Argentina or Portugal but I just
think oh my god like the teams the
players
that these countries have man including
you know England it's just phenomenal
like we have so many good players but
then I look at France they have an
insane 11 you know 11 plays and then you
look at their bench and you're like, "Oh
my god, what?" It's just wow. Like
that's what I mean. Like with a lot of
these teams, they have an insane bench
and it's it just makes such a
difference,
>> dude. I love I love traveling in
England, man.
>> Yeah, England's nice. England's nice.
Especially during the summer. It's
lovely.
>> It's how it should be, man.
>> Uh I have a lot of bros from like
Nigeria and Ghana because I a lot of
content creators. They're very chilled
out guys.
>> Maybe it's Nigerian jeans speaking. I I
I definitely can be very very chilled.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. Especially at home just bro like
nothing better than just watching some
Premier League chilling with my misses
or just watching a movie.
A bro like just just at home with my
cats. [laughter]
>> Yeah. You know in India most football
fans here uh watch more EPL than we
watch our Indian league.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. And and also the Indian league
currently is not on like like our
captain, vice captain, all these guys
have made videos about
>> they they're kind of in a very what the
is happening zone
>> and it's really sad for like Indian
football fans and I've been watching
football for 25 years now
>> and every year I hope that you know
we'll get better
>> things get better. Yeah,
>> but it doesn't man
>> the ecosystem doesn't get support
>> and also I've seen all the African teams
get really good in the last 25 years.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
>> And there's lots of people here. So
mathematically
>> I Well, I'd say like like with the
Premier League like
>> it's probably one of the most watched
leagues in the world. It's probably one
of the most competitive leagues in the
world.
>> It's the most fun league to watch.
>> Yeah. Well, it's just you have all the
best players from all over the place
coming there. But it just yeah it just
takes time and you know hopefully you
know the situation that you mentioned
gets things get better. Yeah.
>> Anyone else mentioned this to you with
this Indian football situation?
>> Never heard the first time.
>> You're going to hear it a lot in the
coming week.
>> Okay. Really? Yeah.
>> Cuz a lot of the guys who watch your
stuff are also football fans.
>> Okay.
>> Lots of people are going to come up and
tell you about this.
>> Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
>> Say something for Indian football ksi.
>> Well, I mean Yeah, bro. Let's let's
increase the increase the money for the
players man like there's a lot of Indian
players that you know want to play
football want to do do well you know
maybe even enter well I mean I think
it'd be great it's great for the Indian
football team in in general like I want
to see India in the World Cup smashing
it
>> and the best way to do that is to fund
>> the country fund the people in the
country thing is money is available and
and I'm not saying this we had an owner
of one of the teams on the show he's
also a big film star
>> he said it on the show
>> okay
>> so people are very aware that there's
corruption and
>> issues but it is what it is man
>> yeah well yeah I I need to educate
myself on it a bit more
>> it's I think you've spent like 24 hours
in India less
>> uh less yeah I' I'd say I've got how
many hours I'd say Six more hours and
then there's 24 hours. Yeah.
>> But you've been here twice.
>> This is my third time. So, the first
time I came uh was a school trip. This
was before I was KSI. Uh school trip.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Talk about that, bro.
>> Why? Well, I went just um to help out an
orphanage and to teach um some students
English.
>> Um yeah, just
>> you were in Mumbai.
>> I I don't know exactly where I was. I
was in India but I don't remember and
I'm going to find out. It's on my I can
actually [laughter] I can show you
pictures. It's on my Facebook.
>> When was this?
>> This was
I can tell you now actually
>> 2007.
>> I'm not too The henry left Arsenal.
[laughter]
>> And went to win the Champions League at
Barcelona.
>> Ah, stop.
>> I love the HR though, dude.
>> No, no, he's I've met I've met him
before. He's
>> Oh, really?
>> Yeah. Yeah. A few times now. He's
>> How did it feel meeting Andre for the
first time,
>> bro? It was like such a surreal moment.
>> Like my heart was like doing this, bro.
Because he was the reason why I became
an Arsenal fan. Yeah. Like my grandma
gave me an an Arsenal top
>> and like I was like, "Oh, this is cool."
And then I'd watch Arsenal games and I
was like, "Oh my god,
>> this is cool." like he just made me love
Arsenal.
>> Yeah, dude. He's one of those players
that you can't hate. Even if like I
support United, a lifelong United
>> Oh my god. United are definitely going
through it right now, man. Like I think
who you uh you've got Solier now.
>> Yeah, I mean
it's Fletch. I I hope with I hope it's
Roy Keane, honestly. Yeah,
>> I hope Roy Keane gets a shot at it.
Well, I just I just feel like
you guys are just so indecisive. Like
with with with a manager, it takes time.
>> Yeah.
>> For their for for their philosophy to
eventually get through. And you know
with Arteta we've given him time but he
hasn't won many things for Arsenal but
he's created this die hard culture fan
fan base and people just love him what
he's created and look at us. We're one
of the best teams in the Premier League
and he's done that. He created that. He
allowed that to happen and you know we
gave him time to get to that. Bro, it
hasn't been all up. It's been several
several downs, but
>> especially at the start.
>> Yeah. Yeah. But but because we gave him
time to do his thing,
>> now look, we're flourishing. And now
looks like we're going to win the
Premier League.
>> Maybe maybe the Champions League also.
>> Well, that's what I mean. Like it's
we're just that good now.
>> Oh, dude.
>> But it'll be really fun if you guys
don't win again.
>> It'll be fun for like the other
>> What? Really? [laughter] I bet. I bet,
man.
Everyone wants us to lose, man. That's
just as as also fans, you just have to
accept that everyone is against you.
[clears throat]
>> Yeah. I mean, but you know, when I was a
kid, the first season I saw was the 2002
season, the Invincible season.
>> Yes. Yes.
>> Uh and since then, I've like distantly
admired Arsenal for whatever. At least
it's pretty football.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> And and I miss being a kid seeing those
four teams do well.
>> Yeah.
>> I miss that era.
>> Yeah. Yeah. United aren't really on our
level anymore. [laughter]
>> Yeah. Yeah. I hate to break it, man.
It's just I mean now it's just Yeah.
Arsenal, Man City really going back to
back. I guess
>> Liverpool as well.
>> Chelsea, I don't know what's going on
with them.
>> I'm waiting for Jude Bellingham to come
back to the EPL. I know he's going to
come back at some point.
>> You think?
>> Oh, yes. He He needs to needs to do it
for his own country.
>> Yeah. I think I think if he won the
World Cup with England, I think he'd be
all right.
>> I think I think the English press aren't
great to certain people. So, I think for
his sake, his mindset, for his psyche,
it's better if he's just in Spain. And
he's killing it in Spain. But like, if
he wants to come by, he can. But
>> yeah, English press ain't great,
>> bro. One of my wildest life moments
being a content creator was podcasting
with Rio Ferdinand who had like seen
>> I saw that. Yeah.
>> Who had seen like growing up.
>> I sat across and I was just like talking
to this guy I've used on FIFA.
[laughter]
>> Y
>> that was a wild feeling.
>> Uh but you know at the end of the
podcast I asked him about his mental
health
>> and he said that it's still up and down.
>> Yeah.
>> And that that makes you like really
think man. Well, I think with everyone
it's going to be up and down, but you
know, as long as you have someone close
to you to talk to you, to communicate
with, especially when you're having
problems, I think that's great. And,
>> you know, don't ever keep stuff in. If
you've got a problem, speak to someone.
>> In the world of content, are the Sideman
guys your best bros?
>> Yeah, I'd say they're good friends.
Yeah. Yeah. really really good friends.
>> Are you allowed to talk about that
closed door meeting that happened where
you guys have discussed the future of
Sideman in detail?
>> Oh.
Oh, that's interesting. Uh where have
you heard that from? We've had several
meetings um just about what we want for
the future and everything. And you know,
I'd say
life happens. Life definitely happens.
Um,
some people have kids, you know, some
people, you know, getting married or are
married and, you know,
>> millennial problems.
>> Well, yeah. And you got to remember like
life isn't how it was 10 years ago. Like
when we started, you know, we were just
free and able to do whatever. Whereas
now it's like, oh, there's there's a lot
more responsibility.
>> Yeah. So, you know, not everyone has the
same goals and it's
to think about seven people getting on
all the time for several several years.
It's
>> Yeah, it's
>> not as simple as
>> It's not as simple. It's not as simple.
So, you know, there's definitely going
to be some ups and downs, but we I think
we work it out. We definitely work it
out most of the time. and we um you know
we try to hang out outside of us filming
but again sometimes it's hard sometimes
it's hard to just do that. So sometimes
a lot of time when we see each other is
when we're filming. [clears throat]
>> So
>> do you have like adult bro conversations
with them? I started doing that a lot
with my bros.
>> Oh yeah.
>> Having kids
wife being
>> Yeah. No we definitely chat. We
definitely chat. We have a, you know,
WhatsApp where we just talk and
everything, but you know, it's it's it's
one of the things where, you know, we
we've always got each other's back.
>> So, yeah.
>> Fair. Um,
what advice do you give to someone like
Speed?
>> Does he ever ask you for advice?
>> Um, not really. Not really. I think I
think he's got it covered. It's kind of
one of those things where I don't know,
you sometimes you don't you feel like
you don't need advice. He's going to
just do his thing.
>> Flow state.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, people
normally ask for advice when
they're not up anymore, if that makes
sense. Like when they're down and
they're going through it, that's norally
when people ask for help and ask, you
know, advice. So, you know, if he ever
gets to that point, I pray he doesn't.
But if he ever does, I I'm always there.
>> Yeah. But he will because that's just
the nature of content creation.
>> Well, yeah, of course. Of course. Like,
yeah, you you you you can be the guy for
a period of time and then eventually
you're not the guy and then it's like
how do you handle that? How do you deal
with that? Or yeah, what do you do with
that? And it's [clears throat] kind of
just like, yeah, I mean, I think that's
where it's good to just
Yeah. Talk just talk to people. Talk to
people who are experienced and know
the mistakes that have been made in the
past that they can learn from.
>> You know, I kind of believe that it's
true for any career
>> like a football career, content career.
I think it happens everywhere. You see a
low, but it's about how you handle
yourself in that phase.
>> Yeah. Yeah. That's that is probably the
most important place
that determines character of a person.
You know, when someone's smashing it
and, you know, killing it in the game
and, you know, everything's happening
and they're just over the moon and, you
know, getting loads of likes and getting
loads of followers and all this and
that. You know, it's how you treat
people at that period
is important because when you get to the
low
low period, people will remember how you
were when you up there. And if you treat
people like
>> and you are not nice,
>> then they're going to take that with you
when you're low down there and they're
going to just not give you an olive
branch and not help you at all. So
ultimately the best advice
just be nice to everyone man. Treat
everyone with respect. Whether they're
the cleaner, whether they're there as a
runner or whether they're a CEO, whether
they're the most famous person, who
cares? They're all the same.
>> Yeah. Hustle, loyalty, respect.
>> It's John Cena.
>> That is John Cena. Yeah. Yeah.
[laughter]
>> But it's true, bro.
>> Yeah. Like you got to get your clothes
tone up a bit before you turn into Super
Saiyan 2 or Super Saiyan.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got to
go through some to go into the next
level.
>> JJ.
>> Mhm.
>> We're out of time today.
>> Okay.
>> But I hope to travel to
This year for sure.
>> I might actually join you. Maybe.
>> Okay. Yeah.
>> Maybe.
>> Come through, bro.
>> Uh I want to make you travel in India a
fair bit. I think there's some places
you'll really enjoy. Not not this time.
>> Oh yeah, for sure. I feel like yeah, I
definitely need to just explore more. I
mean, I am exploring quite a bit uh this
time around, but I compared to the last
time because last time I just felt very
rushed and I felt like I wasn't here for
a long time, whereas now this time I'm
here for a week, so I'm really able to
take everything in.
>> Yeah, dude. I honestly feel travel in
India may not be for everyone but it's
definitely for people who ask deep
questions to themselves in your
>> well I mean you know I always tell my
friends you know India is a great place
you should come through um not all of
them agree [laughter]
>> but it's cuz they've never been here
>> and the idea about India is formed
through algorithms and the algorithms
show show
>> yeah but it's just man
>> I've been to India several times and I
love it and it's great and I'm gonna
keep coming so I don't I don't care what
social media say
>> or show.
>> You can you can
>> I'm here. I'm on the ground and I love
it.
>> You can look at the camera and go love
you India.
>> Love I think [laughter] I think my bro
said India number one when he got here.
[laughter]
>> Lots of fun J.
>> Thank you so much.
>> I hope to see you again in life man.
>> Likewise. Likewise. Take care. Absolute
pleasure.
>> Yeah. I hope you had fun.
>> Yeah. No. It was good. Good talk
honestly. Thank you guys so much. Thank
you. Absolute pleasure.
