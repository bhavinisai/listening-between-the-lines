if you had one chance to redo life today
starting a fresh you're not Kumar
mangalam Bera but you're just Kumar
starting off what business would you put
the money
[Music]
firstly thank you for uh doing this so
the format of this is very casual it's
typically a bunch of friends sitting and
chatting how it started was I used to
have a a few people over for dinner in
Bangalore on the
weekends and some of the conversations
we had were so interesting that a lot of
people would go back home from dinner
and say that you know I wish more people
could be a part of that like extremely
contrarian opinions on different
viewpoints so stuff like that oh that
sounds interesting yeah so this is all
in like uh an effort to help many people
who could learn from your own
Journey uh most of our audience are
entrepreneurs and wannabe entrepreneurs
who are quite young in the age bracket
of I would say 15 to 35
40 and uh from starting at 15 yeah very
young and a lot of them want to be
entrepreneurs and they could learn a lot
from your own Journey so if I could
start at the beginning wherever you want
to talk and think of it as a two-way
conversation if you feel like you want
to ask me anything sure sure feel free
to ask me anything about anything and I
will try and answer as honestly as I can
done my asking you more than you asked
me so tell us little bit
about the early years
first uh vivid memory that comes to you
from childhood start from
there yeah so very happy childhood to
say the least very secure lots
of um
laughter uh great sense of positivity
high energy uh you know very uh close
family ties and where was this so part
of it was in Kolkata right uh the rest
of it was in Bombay but uh you know on
holidays I always went back to Kolkata
mhm because the larger family was there
so for me childhood means Kolkata much
more than mombay uh it's very secure I
think it just gives you uh an anchor and
very strong roots and uh what era was
this era yeah
what generation we moved to Bombay in 69
I think so at least for the next 20
years after that
right leading up to this I watched all
your interviews uh everything from there
aren't too many yeah there's so few yeah
yeah there's very few about you there
are a couple about you acquiring a
company entering the arc
business uh talking about ran at his
demise stuff like that but the one
interview I found of you was 26 years
ago I think Simi
Agarwal what led you to do
that I just thought it was interesting
um I don't know she's a friend H so also
couldn't say no to be honest right um
like the format it was kind of
fun um yeah is it still there on on
YouTube of course yeah that was very
early years I think my father had just
pass away less than a year ago right so
life was different then
right you looked very fashionable in
that interview you had like this double
breasted I would say what brown brownish
camel color I think camel color
jacket this is not something people talk
about like if you were to tell me what
is the ask me what is the difference
between camel brown suede and I don't
know nude color I wouldn't know
but is I yeah no I wouldn't is there a
creative element in you hiding some of
course I think I'm essentially a
creative person and for me the most
creative thing you can do is build or
run a business mhm uh I think there's so
much of creativity that goes into that
into that don't you think
so to a certain extent yes but beyond a
certain extent for a business that has
reached the scale that yours has m is it
creativity as much as it is risk taking
ability and
efficiency risk taking and efficiency of
course is always a part of any business
right uh I think as a business grows
larger and scales up uh you know you
need to be more and more creative
because uh all the sort of uh low
hanging fruit are done with mhm uh and
you've got to keep creating value so I
think you actually need to be that's
when management turns from being a
science into an art mhm um and therefore
I think that phase of a company's life
and you've got scale when you're maybe
the largest or second largest
player uh you require to think really
out of the box so more creativity
required I would
think so grew up in Cal Kolkata and then
Mumbai which school did you go to do you
remember anything from those times I
went to Campion okay um I remember
School quite well very tough en very
strict uh environment so a little
different uh not too much of fun for
better part of it I think we all enjoyed
the you know class nine and 10 because
then you grow up and you have your own
sort of um uh you know you're
independent of school
Authority uh but um good fun M very
simple very
Cosmopolitan you know I mean at our time
at that time it was all very simple
stuff excited to run and get get an ice
cream uh during recess that kind of
thing right getting whacked for not
getting the right book and not wearing
the right kind of shoe uh that was the
kind of school that it was mhm were you
a good student I was a good student for
a big part of uh I think till grade
eight after which I slipped considerably
I don't know why mhm uh but yeah up
Class
8 very
good did everyone in school already
associate you with the bidla and all
that comes with it you know like I said
was a very very C important uh bunch of
students from all walks of life uh we
were also quite innocent and naive
because we didn't have social media to
spoil us for example so quite in our own
cocoon mhm of course people knew the
family name and all of that but it
really didn't affect anyone in any which
way uh I was just one out of a class of
40 let's say right so um it was that
that was a sort
of um the good part about school uh you
didn't get any special attention at all
mhm uh which was which was
nice did media worked differently back
then when you say your classmates did
not know or the school did not treat you
differently even
though uh you were the in a way Kion of
one of the largest business families of
India there was hardly any media then n
i mean you had dur dasan for the most of
my years at school in the' 70s uh in the
' 70s and early '
80s um so it was uh media wasn't a big
part of our Lives maybe more radio but
uh nothing that was uh you know
intrusive or Sensational it was all very
sort of day-to-day kind of news or world
news of political stuff from what I
remember nothing on business families or
nothing that uh you know made you stand
apart did you do you have any insight
into psychologically how you were as a
young boy what your attachment styles
were did you get along more with your
mother or your
father uh what were your aspirations
back then and your fears back
then wow you really are getting me to go
back in
time um like I said it's been family for
me for me all
along uh you know I think strong family
ties makes you a different kind of a
person mhm I've um I've always been
closer to my mother but was very
strongly bonded with my father as well
so in our generation uh chances were
that there was a distance between a
father and a son that was almost kind of
uh you know the D thing or the
norm um but obviously we were very
connected um we all live together I
think I didn't have any fears or I
didn't have any very complex thoughts or
feelings to be honest when I look at uh
children of that age now their lives are
so much more complex right uh they they
know about every student in every school
in Bombay mhm uh and what happened I
mean if something unusual out of the way
was to happen mhm let's say a kid was
caught taking drugs the whole of uh the
city children would know about it
although it wasn't uh in their school
maybe mhm for us it was one class above
us one class below us that's all we knew
we were quite happy with ourselves so I
don't remember having any kind of
fears the only fear was about exams
maybe um as simple as that I was always
the last minute student and got into
trouble with my father for that so that
was perhaps the only
fear uh aspiration at that time again
you you know we were so unexposed in
many ways so it was all about school it
was about school it was about uh you
know you hung out with some friends lots
of cousins not too many aspirations at
that point in life to be really honest
just you know almost one exam to the
other so to speak mhm uh they were the
sort of uh bookends of Life at that
point in
time
um so it was quite a you know
uncomplicated easy childhood I don't
remember feeling any kind of complex uh
inferior or
Superior I don't feel I never felt any
jealousy or Envy or nothing negative at
all I think it was always U that was
always the atmosphere at home as well
right uh a little stressed because I
created that stress for myself I wanted
to always do well not that it was uh you
know thrust on me but that was an
expectation I had from myself that
perhaps was the only stress uh at that
point in time if you had to go back in
time and
think of the most stressful thing that
happened to you between the grade of
five and 10 is there a memory that pops
out I think the icsc exams they were
quite a the 10 standard uh great 10 uh
very hyped up very scary for most of us
that uh by far was U uh the most scary
thing up until class 10 right otherwise
I mean it was just a very simple
childhood we grew up a lot of cousins
together U you know lots of
fun uh I mean I studied as well soon
after that I started to study for my CA
but up until 10th it was only about the
the most worrisome thing in life was uh
examinations
right uh a lot of what we are today I'm
a psychology fiend so I like reading
books on psychology not that I know too
much but the little bit that I know
tells me that a lot of how we are today
are deter determined and defined by
events that happened in that duration of
our
life uh and I've said this before but I
find that a lot of very successful
people
today are building on top of some kind
of
Confrontation avoiding confrontation
vicariously viewing confrontation or
uh something shameful that happened it
could be as simple as a teacher slapping
a child uh how that shame is felt by the
child and how you build around it and
what it becomes when you're an adult is
a completely different thing did you
have any Stark moments like that which
went into defining who you are as a
person today at school or at home you
know I I there was nothing at school I
did get wacked around a couple of times
by teachers that was more about you know
talking in between classes and stuff
like that M nothing that left any kind
of impact at
all the impact at at home was huge MH uh
so my grandfather was alive
great-grandfather was alive at the time
mhm my grandfather and father were
obviously there all three
working um so high energy I mean I used
to see all of them and there was so much
to learn just from a chat like this on
the dining table
um lot of perspective about life I think
that a lot of my uh self assuredness
comes from that phase of my
life because they were
encouraging um happy to let you
explore at the same time there was a
sense of doing one's duty and doing it
well um discipline was something that uh
you know uh I remember as being a
Hallmark of the family in a nice way mhm
um so yes I think those years uh uh the
school years influences at home were
much stronger and I agree with you I
think that those years actually shape
you to become the adult that you
become uh very secure like I said so I
think this self assuredness comes from a
sense of great
security
um yeah it's a very happy time do you
remember how each of them were different
from the other
grandfather from father to
great-grandfather you know they were all
products of uh different uh time frames
so my great-grandfather was uh you know
pretty much a product of uh
pre-independent India right my
grandfather a time of scarcity MH
because that's the time that he uh kind
of represented the time that he was
active in his career scarcity by virtue
of India flirting with
socialism socialism also we were
obviously U you know uh at a nent stage
of being a developing country right
um
so I mean you sort of lived within your
means you didn't spend too
much uh it was a very different the
Mind scape at that time was uh very
different my father grew up in
liberalized India MH um and I think you
know the businesses uh that you run also
shape you as a person it's not just the
other way around so all of them were
pretty distinct my father was more
expansive in his view on business my
great-grandfather of course played a
very important role in just building
Indian industry at at the Grassroots
level uh just pre and post
Independence um my grandfather was
more
conservative uh and he was a numbers
person so he drove his
businesses uh to numbers so to speak so
pretty different all of them uh
interesting so when your grandfather was
around in a time of scarcity in the
country overall when he saw that change
did he change no he he remained very
much the same he passed about 5 years
ago and I happened to go and open his
cupboard after that looking for
something he had five Kur kuras and dois
and three suits and that was about it
just to get him to make a new suit for
himself was like a major project for uh
my grandmother and my aunt that that's
the kind of you know life that they were
used to and that's the kind of life that
uh we got exposed to through them so I
don't know many people who have had uh
whove been told to go back uh into the
room put off the light or the fan mhm
that for us at that time was you know
pretty kind of common because it was
expected that when you leave the room
you put on the fan you put off the light
uh so we had a brush with that also
since we were growing up then and that
in itself that in itself is a is a big
piece of
learning and your
father very different to your
grandfather very different um the values
pretty much remain the same but I think
he was uh more of a risk taker wanting
to
um expand uh his business outside the
country more aggressively it was also
different India right mhm uh so you
could take bigger bets than say my
grandfather could right didn't have the
opportunity then in any case mhm so yeah
they were all three very different
people I had a great U rapper with all
of them um
every equation was very different as you
can
imagine um so yeah a lot of love and a
lot of U uh a lot of good cheer and
laughter closest to your grandfather and
then your
father uh difficult to say actually n
very different equations with all of
them um my great-grandfather at that
time when I was growing up I spent a
couple couple of hours every Sunday with
him so for me he was just my best friend
I drag him for a movie and um he take me
to the aquarium that was pretty much the
only thing you could do in Bombay at the
time uh my grandfather was doting he
just loved me immensely U you know just
an otion of love both of them my father
was U uh tough Taskmaster so when I
started going to work I saw an thought
of him that I really hadn't experienced
before um which was different um you
know I think when in our company people
come to me and complain about being
under a tough boss I'm thinking in my
mind you know they have no idea what a
tough boss uh can be all about can you
elaborate how how was he
tough like he was tough because he just
uh you just had to be on top of things
all the time time uh you couldn't nap at
the wheel even for a minute in the day
you'd get caught out uh in some way or
the other uh so he was just very
demanding he was uh he also gave me a
lot of space I must say much more than
let's say fathers at uh that time did
but he was also very
demanding uh and uh you know he was very
driven and very demanding of himself as
well so I think that was fair
M what age were you when he passed
away I was 28 uh Nel he was uh 52 so MH
obviously died uh very young MH and
tragically I think that shaped all of
our lives uh differently after his
passing what did you feel when he passed
away I'll give you a personal story my
father passed away like 10 11 months ago
what are your thoughts
as soon as something like that happens
when it's
unexpected and how do your thoughts
evolve after one year two years and 5
years what was the first thing that
happened to a 28-year-old Kumar when
father abruptly passed away no so he was
suffering for cancer for 2 years it's
just that uh you know the cancer kind of
galloped we thought he had 10 years he
suddenly took ill and things uh took a
turn for the
worse um
the first thing actually was a sense of
relief for him mhm because he'd gone
through so much of pain for those two
years MH that I you know I really
couldn't see him suffer anymore it was
very evident that he wouldn't be able to
uh lead a normal life again and he
wouldn't be happy not not being able to
do that so I really see the first
feeling was one of relief for him then
you start to feel this emptiness you I I
never really thought this would happen
you did feel uh a sense of loss you also
started to feel a sense of big
responsibility mhm uh that you know
falls on you and I think work was my
biggest Escape mhm got involved with
that wanted to
also uh give back to him in some way mhm
by carrying forward his name his legacy
and doing the work that you know he had
wanted to do but couldn't complete mhm
and I think that was a huge uh sort of
like I said an escape uh working very
long hours but doing things that you
know he wanted to do but couldn't and
that kind of I think blunted the uh you
know this sense of emptiness to a large
extent if you could change one thing
about your father while he was alive one
character trait uh most people people
when we when we speak about people who
have passed away
uh we have to euphemize the bad and
embellish the good
almost right uh all humans have plus
plus plus and minus minus minus
and I find it hard to do it today cuz
it's only been 10 11 months it's
probably too soon
but if I have to tomorrow figure
out why I am am the way I am and what
traits I inherited from my father I'll
have to like at some point be objective
about this whole thing so if if you had
to change something about your
father by curiously living like him
while he was alive what would you change
you know retrospection N is a very
powerful tool so it's um all very well
for me to say that he could have been
different in this way and that way but
uh I mean what at at the most I could
say that he could have spent more time
with us but you know he was in a phase
where he was building his career MH uh I
went through that phase myself MH and I
know what the pressures of that phase uh
of one's career uh can be like I I don't
think that I would have wanted him to be
any different um you know all of us have
uh Our rough edges we have
a pet peeves he had his as well but um I
think he was a good man he was a good
father mhm uh protected us pushed me
quite a lot um because I think I needed
to be pushed at that point in time are
you like him I'm very different from him
uh we are all pretty different people
actually I think circumstances I think
uh you know uh the shape of your own
childhood mhm uh people in your life mhm
everything is different I was always
also very encouraged by everyone to be
my own person whilst I was growing up M
uh that was a constant refrain you know
be your own person my great-grandfather
used to tell me that a lot um you know I
think I was in class five or six and I
remember him saying you know you've got
to take your own decisions now uh any
important decision of your concerning
your life should be years and he'd come
to Bombay every couple of months and
he'd always ask me have you started
taking your own decisions or are your
parents taking your decisions for
you you know in that kind of an
environment think about it you're
empowered right you given the currency
to uh make important
decisions uh and be you know an
independent decision maker I think I
think that was just terrific I mean I
mean that worked really well for
me um I always had a mind of my own my
father knew that uh he he really pushed
me hard like I said and I think you know
I I'm really grateful to him for that um
I was a sort of a bit of a dreamer
then
um and that drive uh you know was
required and what did you which he
pushed me into he almost pushed me off
the precipice so to speak
and when you say dreamer what did you
dream of doing what does the alternate
life look like nothing I had no other
plan I always wanted to join him at work
MH um I didn't have an alternative to be
honest but luckily for me I had no other
you know sort of burning desire to do
something else some great talent uh this
was something that I'd grown up seeing
around me I'd always been fascinated by
and uh so it was pretty much taken for
granted uh and that's what I actually
wanted to do as well I just found the
conversations uh that the three of them
had quite uh interesting
always uh you know the way they spoke
about a business situation setting up a
new business about their people they
also had their own teams all three of
them and their teams were also quite
different from each other in some way
the reflection of uh you know you know
the leader the three of
them uh so business always fascinated me
you know so I I I don't think I had
there was no issue there about I want to
do this but they want me to do that or
you know I have a great talent which I'm
not able to pursue because I have to
join the family um in business that that
phase luckily didn't happen with me at
all this is something very interesting
about attachment types I've always tried
to figure out mine and I feel like
I'm avoidant attached I'll give you an
example if three children were left
alone in a room and their mothers leave
the room the children start crying the
mother of the first child comes back and
coddles the child the child stops crying
immediately the mother of the second
child comes and coddles the child the
child takes a certain amount of time of
crying after which the child stops
crying the third child
the mother leaves the C room does not
cry and the mother comes back into the
room acts like it doesn't care and does
not give attention or acknowledge the
mother's presence if you had to put
yourself in one of those boxes which one
would you as a parent or as a child as a
child you know since uh we were quite a
few members in the family MH uh my
grandparents my aunts two aunts my those
are my father sisters who have been very
close to my grandparents parents who
were a very sort of integral part of my
life so you kind of uh and my
great-grandfather my parents of course
you know each one had their own kind of
like I was saying pet peeve mhm uh they
were all different personalities
sometimes when I look back now I almost
feel that it was choreograph you know
one was being a good cop one was being a
bad cop um but uh
you know net net that worked quite well
actually uh if let's say I had a parent
who believed let's say in tough love and
no one to in in the family to soften
that for me MH I think that would have
been much tougher uh but when you have
uh when you're attached to so many
people in the family it gives you a
broader base right a broader emotional
base so it worked uh as a as a team I
think like a pack M uh and that's true
for all of us I think we all kind
of we part of a family obviously and
like a pack in Love Today is it like
that in a relationship where you're in
love with the other
person are
you very emotionally availably attached
to the person who me
yeah um very easily emotionally
available yes but to very few people who
comes on top of that hierarchy the
children of course I think that's true
one of them all three of them uh I have
a different equation with all three of
them right um they all three very
special kids I'm sure every father
thinks that uh about uh his kids I
definitely do about mine but um you know
emotional availability I think has to be
restricted to just a very few people
right uh it can damage you otherwise
right
um how many people do you think that
should be in that uh the lucky five or
six I'd say six or seven right um I
wouldn't want to be emotionally
available mhm uh to more than that I
mean how would
you isn't that a very taxing thing it is
yeah I don't think I'm very emotionally
available it's a big flaw of
mine uh I didn't this is not a
self-actualization thing where I realiz
it but I've
had multiple people tell me I'm
emotionally available and today I'm at
that place where if more than two or
three people tell me something at some
point I have to acknowledge it
acknowledge it not outwardly but to
myself maybe there's something to it so
I think I'm a fairly emotionally
unavailable person what makes you like
that actually what's the problem in
being like that yeah I feel like uh
my hierarchy they say whatever is on top
of your list of hierarchies that you
believe in is God for you I feel like my
list of hierarchies might be slightly
different from somebody aspiring to a
very Balanced
Life I'm in that phase of life where
balance is not the ultimate goal
but uh maybe stupidly I have my own
little quals and ambitions that give me
short-term validation and I chase them
and maybe that makes me emotionally
unavailable you're saying that this is
about work life balance or in what way
do you mean that I feel like balance
between everything not just work and
life outside of work
but the
philosophical definition of balance I
think is a balance between
self-actualization spirituality figuring
out your place in the Eos system where
the world is uh I think it's much
broader I don't think I play any part in
that or I spend enough time dwelling on
that even the work life balance I don't
really have it I'm working all the time
yeah yeah and I don't think I can ever I
mean I don't think I'm made like that
yeah um but isn't that one of the things
you wanted to change about your father
my father yeah no not really I
mean why would you want to change uh
anything about anyone I'm saying that
today when I'm when I'm 57 I didn't feel
that when I was at your age but honestly
that I I mean the only thing I can think
of is I wish he'd spent more time with
us right uh but after having been
through that phase where you're
intensely involved in you know growing
your business mhm uh you're on a very
steep learning curve MH I pretty much
understand his Prett
uh you know it is about how do you
balance time between work and family
it's as simple as
that uh other than that I don't think
that uh I would have liked him to be you
know different in any
way
um yeah I don't see why I what did what
would you have liked I know it's still a
little raw for you but anything about
your dad that you would have M liked to
be different yeah I feel like it is a
bit Raw cuz it's not been a year yet
but I feel like he would I I would wish
for him to have
been more transient in his belief
systems even more than he already was uh
like you said now that's that's quite
deep [ __ ] yeah so in what way he was
unwilling
to
change many of the beliefs systems that
were inculcated into him very early and
I think he would have been a happier
person if he had allowed for them to
change like I can like really go into
this for example even the construct of
marriage M
or the traditional societal construct of
marriage I feel
like another version of it might have
made it better for him I don't mean
another person but another
version uh a lot of the things in
life are not voluntary choices that we
are making you they can't be yeah reason
in itself is not organic I feel like the
world tells us what is right or wrong uh
and we conform more often than not
because not conforming is a lot more
work than
conforming and I think he did conform in
many
ways and I wish he kind of like
questioned not his choices but societal
Norms more so he could have made Cho
would that have impacted your and your
brother's life in a different way or it
might have but I feel like you think he
would have been a happier person is that
what is that the space you come from
yeah I feel like we wrongly take the
burden of responsibility for things that
we actually don't control but we think
we can
control if each person finds what makes
him happy and he's true to
that I would suspect the other people
who love him will be happier by virtue
of
that that's a deep one
again yeah no actually when I think
about about it the only thing that made
my uh dad worry about me was the fact
that I didn't always
confirm uh and that sort of you know got
him really worried especially when it
CES came to aing my opinions about
people most most
often uh he didn't think it was a good
idea to have strong
views um on people issues and situ
situations especially in the family or
uh in a home
context uh and I was always very liberal
with My Views mhm um that's just the DNA
I guess that
I've been born
with uh and he was always a little on
the edge because of that a little
careful about you know what is he going
to say next and I wasn't
particularly uh you know careful about
who I'm say saying
something too if I didn't agree with you
I could be pretty opiniated and come
across as being you know uh very
apparent that I I don't
agree um that could be a relative that
could be a guest it could be a friend of
the families that's something that he
couldn't quite understand right
conforming is is something that it is a
very sort of double-edged Sword right so
you have to kind of strike a balance I
think uh the pressure to perform or
conform on your generation is much less
than it was on
us my which I think is U you know huge
but I think my generation being voke is
also conforming to being
voke I don't think anybody has thought
deeply enough about the contrarian
viewpoints of the prior generation that
we are taking we are woke today because
it's cool to be woke so you're saying
that being woke is not really uh rooted
in you know actual belief about
something it's just about being cool and
being going with the tide yeah that you
will I think you'll always have a
majority of people who are like
that I mean you know that that something
that's not going to change not in your
generation not in the generation after
that
but I think that U not being able to
conform MH in some ways gives you more
choices right I mean it gives you uh
more latitude in the choices you make
about say career yeah about so many
things life is much easier when uh the
need to conform
is you know much lower yeah it's like
wine every year of wine a certain
vintage of wine has certain
characteristic I feel like the mask of
wokeness is my generation's
characteristic and the default setting
is the mask and it's the easier setting
so nobody really has to question why we
are book yeah but I think that people
with people you uh interact with you
know fairly closely The Mask will always
fall if someone's advocating something
just beoke and not because they believe
in it you know that mask always
falls and you know a lot of people most
people want to confirm mhm uh they want
to be part of the crowd and swim with
the tide so that's that's not uh I I
don't find that
unusual is there something what are you
work about you you ask what is the mask
I've put on not the mask what are you
actually work about deeply if I I really
care
about I feel like
a lot of successful people like
yourself would have taught a certain
thing at a certain point of time in life
and voiced it it might be your family
Legacy it might be the tenets of the
Bera family
and
um with time we buy into this philosophy
so deeply that we lose all ability to
tweak nudge change it
uh if people were
allowed to change their minds more often
without judgment is something I think
will help humans evolve faster if I
believed in something 5 years ago and I
change my mind about it drastically
today the term society would give it is
hypocrisy the real term that should be
attached to it I think is
evolution and uh we should be all more
welcoming of people changing their
viewpoints and where they stand in
society about different things I think
it just speeds up the rate of evolution
of
society yeah you know I think that's a
feeling that every generation feels so
if that makes you feel any better
uh I I've never been someone who's
overly concerned about uh what people
say in fact that's uh you know I grew up
being told that you know must be careful
like like I said I was quite open about
quite strong strong about my opinions on
things and
people uh and my friends my cousins
would tell me that you don't seem to
care about what other people are saying
U look at what he is saying what she
it's just something that doesn't affect
meh it never has uh you know I mean of
course one understands one's
responsibilities and duties and all of
that that and as long as you're doing
good with that uh other people's
opinions have never mattered to me yeah
other than you know my own Inner
Circle not good or bad or right or wrong
it's just we have been and I think that
has been very liberating for me uh that
takes a huge pressure off
you um and that comes from you know an
inner conviction it's not because I want
to project that or uh want to be like
that
is just the way you know I've always
been um and I think that's worked to my
advantage why the conscious decision to
not speak publicly about what you're
thinking I I think you barely have like
I was saying the last real interview I
watched was 26 years ago why is
that you know I have pretty much
consciously stayed away from the media I
don't that my job uh requires me to
be uh in people's faces all the time and
personally I'm I'm a private person I
don't I I'm not very sort of keen on
sharing uh things about my personal life
or uh you know I'd rather keep all of
that my personal thoughts to
myself
um that's pretty much it there's no no
other reason for that I mean you have
platforms to uh express your opinions if
you want to right whether it's at work
or whether it's with the government
whether it's your family MH and rather
than speak about it to people at
large through the media you'd rather I'd
rather speak about it at an appropriate
Forum or an appropriate platform it
could be a dinner table conversation so
I've never really shied away from like I
said from speaking my mind if uh uh it's
something that really matters to me or
bothers me uh never worried about
becoming unpopular on account of that or
you know kind of rubbing someone the
wrong way if if it comes from a place of
conviction but it doesn't have to be
something that's known to the whole
world uh it's something that I think
needs to be spoken of to the appropriate
audience if you had zero fear like I'm
scared of so many things right like
I'm scared of uh judgment online I'm
Shar I'm scared of perception government
regulator this that the other like a 100
different things if you were scared of
nothing M and you had to say one thing
that Society needs to hear but nobody is
saying it what would it
be what would what would it be for you
give me an example I feel like men's
Mental Health is as
important uh to society as anything else
and we should give it the place and
weightage that it
deserves yeah your
turn yeah no I I think that um you know
equality in terms
of uh let's say there's a marriage MH uh
you know I've seen this so often girl
side boy side and the whole society
construct around that
what is expected of the boy side what is
uh so much more expectation on the girl
side that kind of equality is something
that I think we need to uh you know
strive to make uh a change uh with its
mindset mindsets it's
about uh it's tradition sometimes
sometimes it's just the way people are
but I think that that's such an
important role
uh in our
society uh you know it has so many good
and bad
consequences it would be good for people
to speak about that create awareness
around
that you know for example for a lot of
parents uh boys parents asking for
daughters's parents boys parents asking
for doy is something that's quite
normal they say you know as
I mean what's wrong with it some of
these I think require radical change and
someone has to start to talk about them
and create
awareness uh that's something that I I
feel quite strongly about because I just
think that you know there are so many
people who uh are indebted for their
whole life because they spent so much on
getting their daughter married not in
our society but in a lot of societies
that we would't even imagine uh you know
things like uh this happening
in that kind of thing uh makes me
feel uh like it needs to be talked about
by opinion maker mindsets changed long
process but that's something that would
uh bother me interesting it it
shapes that's
how uh you know Society at that level
gets shaped that's how family
units get shap I remember just just a
few days ago uh we run this scholarship
in my father's name
mhm and uh it was at 25th year and some
of the scholars uh who've been Scholars
over the years were talking about it one
girl said I come from a very uh
conservative family we didn't have
finances to educate both me and my
brother mhm my my uh parents obviously
chose to educate my brother mhm
and were it not for the scholarship I
don't think I would have had uh
reasonable quality of Education that's
that's you see the inequality there um
that is something that bothers
me
uh it's it's uh very deep rooted and um
but you know one must create awareness
about it what is legacy to
you that's a big one Legacy to me is
more about impact
not so much about uh aqualads it's about
the impact you had on people on society
in in a case like say in the case of our
family it's more about impact through
business um I think that's what
creates uh Legacy the way you connect
with people the way you give back to
society whether it impacts lives
families in a direct way that is uh
Legacy to
me uh that's how we think of Legacy I
mean that's
what um any of us I think in the family
would think of when one talks of Legacy
do you think generosity is a magnet for
power you know in a are you saying in a
corporate in a corporate context giving
back is not generosity I think it's just
something that um look you're taking
from society and generating a profit
right so giving a part of that back to
society is something that for me and for
all of us is a given is not a big big
deal I mean it's something that you
ought to be doing in the first place in
any case mhm and why make such a big
deal out of it mhm uh it's almost a
responsibility you know as we as I look
ahead uh globally I think maybe after
the church in some parts of the world or
the government of course uh everywhere
in the world uh corporates are going to
be one of the most important
stakeholders mhm globally in every every
part of the world
practically so that comes with the
inherent uh responsibility would you say
that order is State Church
Corp church I'm adding like all yeah I I
think even if that would be the case I
mean that's always up for debate but the
the point remains that corporates still
are a very important and a
growing uh part of society and the
expectation or the desire to give back
is a responsibility and it's not really
something that uh unusual or something
that's altruistic I mean it's just
something that should be
done uh because you're just giving back
to society from which the business
forget about the individual part of it
of course also but when you're getting
so much uh for business to play a role
in impacting Society
positively is just part of a chatter of
business I don't think that it needs to
be uh called out as philanthropy
necessarily uh that that's how we would
view it which is why also we wouldn't
talk about it not for any other reason
but you know a lot of people uh have
asked
as to why there's no
documentation on the work the family has
done over the years over
Generations um and I did ask this to
some of the family Elders a few years
ago and obviously no one was interested
in doing
that um I don't think there's anyone in
the family today who knows about all the
Charities that have been done over the
years in terms of
contribution Community Asset
building uh and I I think it would be
great to document it just as an archival
thing for the family for our children
grandchildren obviously no one in the
family other than me believes there's
Merit to doing that MH uh which is quite
telling actually mhm uh but there is no
one who knows about everything that's
been done in terms of giving back uh
through the generations there are so
many things you hear about go on a plant
visit and there be people who will come
and say that
right and if I ask the family Elders
none of them would sort of mhm sometimes
even know about
it so I mean it's a different way of
giving it's it's what some people would
call gupt Dan Dan which
means it's really something that you
know doesn't need to be talked about a
revealed so to
speak it's just in the normal course of
business normal course of
Life your family had a very interesting
past with Mahatma Gandhi can you tell us
more about that he's such a enigmatic
figure in our own country's history but
uh not enough is spoken about
him today maybe and uh if you had if you
have any stories any any like
interesting things that happened he
lived in your house in the last part of
his life as well right I mean this was
well before I was born n yeah um but you
know
essentially uh there is this
socioeconomic concept of trusteeship
which my great-grandfather having spent
so much of time with him and being a uh
close associate came to embrace which is
that you know private companies in the
private sector so to speak are more U uh
it's more about Collective Prosperity as
opposed to emblems of
capitalism uh again it comes back to the
same topic that we were talking about
philanthropy it's not about philanthropy
just about giving back that concept of
trustee ship uh has just percolated down
uh the generations of course one has
heard about uh the times when he stayed
in our family home uh the day that he
was sh
yeah and you know what happened after
that where people were my grandmother
remembered clearly where she was when
this happened and how they all went
rushing down and you know uh all all the
events that kind of happened after
that uh but I think the gandhian way of
living there is still an element of
that uh that
exists um so for
example you you know we we would do a
10minute Puja for Diwali 10 minute Puja
for
Holy uh I used to ask my you know my
parents why is it that we don't
celebrate so you celebrate if you want
there's no harm but we don't believe in
this uh thing of
uh uh you know uh spending too much time
uh on uh rituals for example a small
thing uh so there are there are sort of
strong
pieces of that Legacy that also
remain uh which I find quite endearing
actually uh obviously much less than
before I
mean I remember my grandparents telling
me my grand aunts how they lit a bonfire
at the back of the house during the
Freedom Movement and they all sort of
you know uh burned their clothes that
they had that were imported started to
wear KH
obviously doesn't that passion doesn't
sort of obviously stay the way it was at
that point in
time but I think that there are elements
of that uh philosophy or that way of
life way of
thinking uh that still you know come up
every now and then uh within the family
and I think we're so fortunate for
that any like if you were to describe
him in three
words just the individual not the public
Persona of all that we know about him
from a story that has been foretold in
the family or has come down Generations
how would you describe the man Mahatma
Gandhi that's a tough one
um liberal I
think yeah I mean I think he the
influence in in that he had uh on my
great-grandfather that for my family
would indicate to me that he was one to
be overly sort of cowed down by societal
Norms mhm uh quite liberal in the way he
thought uh and and that influence was
something that rubb off anything else
about
him not really n i mean um when you go
to our family house which is now of
course uh owned by the government you'll
see that uh um it was uh you know if you
see uh his room
his chashma
book you know like a sort of a bed
obviously believed in uh Simplicity mhm
not uh accumulating for himself at all
obviously that's something that everyone
knows about
him um but uh yeah I think he was quite
liberal in his thought in many
ways if we were to go back to the innate
nature of human
beings and we say there is no such thing
as true
altruism everybody gets some kind of a
high for the ones who don't get it from
capitalism it might be from being a
contrarian it might be a moralistic high
it might be that philanthropy gives
somebody a high would you agree with
that concept that we are all chasing a
high which only we can Define for
ourselves give me an
example like if I were to find a person
who does not believe in accumulating
money uh somebody
who I I don't want to take the example
of somebody who's not alive anymore but
somebody who's alive who has dedicated
his life to philanthropy for
example do you think
that is appeasing his his morality in
such a way that it is giving a high
which might be bigger than the high of
capitalism even cuz it's rarer in
today's capitalist could well be I mean
it's I I guess it's a case toase
situation can't
generalize uh but if one has spent his
or her life uh you know being
philanthropic chances are that they
truly believe in that which is why they
lived a life uh that they chose to live
even if there is some element of making
you feel uh you know like a high if
you're supporting people you know in
whatever way that you are I think that's
fair I mean how does that matter that's
that's just the human mind fair we'll go
back to your high school we went up
until then in Bombay yeah uh so 10th
standard ICC exams did well very well
yeah and then College
was well I went to Junior College uh in
uh syam okay um uh later in HR I had
started to study for my CA uhhuh um even
during the icsc
break um so I was studying from my CA
alongside my
graduation uh I actually became a CA 6
months after graduating mhm
uh which is quite hard which is very
hard uh not something that I enjoyed at
all I mean that was a tough tough phase
of life because when your friends were
having a relatively good time mhm you
had to work pretty hard right um and
what was the driving factor to put in
that work so my you didn't have to I
didn't want to do a SE at all I thought
it was very dry very boring it's a very
tough it used to be I mean the past
percentage was I think 2 or 3% when I
gave it so you can imagine the kind of
stress mhm it
causes and I wasn't the kind of person
who would get into it and not get out of
it uh successfully on the kind of person
who would drop things Midway was that
the weight of expectations and lineage
or was that coming from inside it was
just something my my father was
convinced that I needed to do a CA and
an MBA MH uh he pretty much uh you know
set the agenda for my professional life
at that time which I think was fair
because he had a very good understanding
of me my strengths my weaknesses what my
you know likely uh work that I would do
in the future would entail in terms of
skill
sets uh so essentially uh he just said
to me that if you're not going to be a c
MBA you can't come and work in our
office there's no role that I can give
to you and you know I I just saw all my
ambitions fly out of the window right
because all the Ambitions or whatever I
had in terms of wanting to do things uh
create things were all related to
business that was my biggest
exposure I think that at our time they
used fear as a motivator every now and
then mhm which uh
I kind of understand now didn't
understand then but I figured quite
easily that uh quite quickly that this
was really something that I would have
to do mhm um I didn't have a choice so
it was a painful three or four four or
five years I just did it because I knew
that that was my ticket to some of the
things that I wanted to do in the future
mhm do you think fear is a significantly
larger more powerful motivator than love
for
example I think says this uh makali is
like I don't know like Italian chanaka
maybe if you were to like draw down an
Indian
analogy but when he was advising the
medich and the Roman and the Florentine
Emperors of the time he always said
that as a
leader depict
or influence fear among people is a far
will have a far longer tenure of rule
successful tenure of rule than if you
were to show love to people because fear
can be controlled and love
cannot what do you think about
that I I don't believe in that I think
fear is something that for example I
wouldn't want my children to be fearful
of anything unless they're doing
something that's incorrect or unethical
which is not going to happen just
knowing the way they are I don't think
they they need to be fearful why fear I
mean fear is something that can really
uh you know quash you as as a
personality why would
you it's also very different context
right I'm talking about uh I was 202
that's about 35 years ago parenting was
very different think that
clearly in today's context I don't think
that fear should have a role I don't
think it can have any kind of positive
role to play in one's life you have a
very kind way of explaining things I
read somewhere or someone said that you
never lose your cool you've lost it only
twice I've lost it 18 times in 30 29
years and the reason
I I'm I remember this number so
specifically is that it to me it's a
black mark if you're losing your cool
especially at work you know you you're
blessed to have so many colleagues who
MH uh who put in so much of uh their
emotional
intellectual Equity their
time then for me to have to lose my cool
is is really a not a very good
commentary on me as a
leader uh therefore I've kept account of
it having said that you know sometimes
uh it's important to be angry I mean
that's that's for the better you need to
be angry just to uh you know Express a
point of view that otherwise is sort of
not going through I'm not getting
registered as strongly as as
required but
um yeah I I think that uh uh I'm a much
easier person today than I was maybe
even 10 years ago
um even
personally uh I'm I'm much less likely
to lose my
cool uh or lose my shirt over something
the chances of me just walking away from
the situation are much
higher I I think that's
just uh learning from
life it's also a lot of spirituality
that you touched upon sometime
back um
I just think that getting angry
is unless it's something that you know
and it depends on what I'm saying in the
in the context of work uh having to get
angry
is it shouldn't happen very
often uh for me it's not happened very
often and it's worked there are tough
comp conversation that you that you need
to haveh and I've had several tough
conversations s on a one to one or with
small teams that's very different from
getting
angry
um getting angry in some way let's say
in a corporate context is also a little
bit about getting out of control almost
in my
mind uh and
therefore not a very good thing the way
I see
it are you somebody who you look like a
very soft person and not someone who's
going to get I never get angry angry
yeah I can't remember the last time how
do you do that uh I feel like my how I
arrived at not getting angry
is uh a lot weaker than it is for you I
grew up around
confrontation and I don't get angry
because I want to avoid confrontation
that comes with the angle but that's
fair I think that's mature way to look
at it yeah so I'm actually escaping
confrontation and you're likely very
right that sometimes one has to be angry
but because I'm incapable of being angry
I'm somebody who's more again a weakness
of mind but passive aggressive I
would much rather ignore a person than
confront the person which would have led
for me to need to have been angry I
don't cry much as well like I can count
on my fingers how many times I've have
cried in the last decade D How would how
would the two be
connected
uh I feel like extreme emotion on one
side
is succumbing to the
moment the other side anger is I think
trying to engulf the
moment uh so on those two extreme
extremes of that pendulum I rarely go
like I said five times I remember
brother stroke dad dog passing away
maybe one
breakup and I can't even remember the
fifth in the last
decade that's quite something that's
unusual yeah yeah it is so you're very
controlled then controll in your
emotions fairly controlled yeah to the
extent that people have called me
emotionally dead people who should not
be calling me emotionally dead if you
know what I mean is that worrying to you
or
it's not it's done in a way that it it's
done by Design no no it's not designed
it's
just uh
circumstance I use the excuse of work I
tell myself that I have been a investor
Trader for 21 years of my life I started
at 17 I'm 38
today and there I do well by virtue of
being Nono emotional and not reacting
not emoting to
Something in work or even personally
even personally so you've trained
yourself to be like that yeah I think so
also that's a very convenient excuse to
me for me yeah so I use it excuse for
what excuse for when somebody comes
asking why are you emotionally like
this you say that my work demand me to
be like this yeah say that maybe my work
has made me like
this I do get sad could well be right I
mean work we do does shape us to an
extent yeah so that's probably also a
genuine reason I'm sure the work you do
has shaped you I mean your work is 100
times bigger than my work I think the
nuances of it would have shaped your
personality in so many ways the stresses
of your life which led you to being the
way you are today only you will know
right and I'm guessing you must have so
many how many people work under the
umbrella
now so uh across the group we have
180,000
people that's like a
country yeah but it's it's one team
that's the way we look at it which it
truly is yeah uh common I mean with a
common purpose in some way everyone's
pulling in the same direction and that's
very you know
energizing kind of a environment to be
in okay so we went to college you became
you were a very precocious young man who
did chartered accountancy much faster
than should be humanly
possible say that
again 6 months faster than what was the
time frame you
said no I was saying that I completed my
CA within 6 months of graduating wow
which uh yeah
which was a tough one what was the
proficiency there mathematics was
it I think the proficiency was just to
be able to absorb a lot of things and
retain that and you know kind of
reproduce it memory in an exam of course
memory but it also is about just share
volume and how well you retain that and
understand
that uh that that of course was the
interesting part of it
is it like that even today are you able
to retain inordinate amount of
information yeah less than before but uh
that's also part of my job since we're
in so many different businesses so I've
trained myself a little bit little bit
to be like that
also so after CA next what happened I
mean I got married worked for my father
I was also working with my father father
was doing my CA mhm um which meant just
sitting next to him
mhm it was like a real-time MBA which
part of the business so he had by then
been detected with
cancer and in retrospect I think he kind
of
uh rep pivoted the training uh program
that he had for me after that made it
quite smooth for me me but U he just
wanted me to be with him through the day
you know sit through meetings be in
different
situations um all kinds of businesses
even then in a sense some that were
doing well some that weren't doing well
just to give me a sense of uhu uh you
know different businesses across the
group a more Pang group kind of uh exp
exposure which meant that uh I sat with
him for 8 n hours every day
uh quite tough but I could see very
quickly that there's lots to be learned
here um what era real time which
year so this would be uh you know as
part of your ca you can intern with a
company and I chose to obviously do that
with our
company so this was probably when I was
18 so
85 I
guess uh it was an interesting time I
mean very different time from now again
and I remember that I remember my mother
he used to complain to my
mother quite often that I don't think
Kumar pays
attention I used to tell her you know
I'm sitting right under his nose
literally I mean I I I could almost be
on his
lap uh and why on on Earth would not pay
attention I
mean so this went on for for a while
three or four times then eventually I
told her you know you must ask him to
stop and ask me about what's happening
my views or something about what's being
discussed because that's the only way
that he will know whether I'm paying
attention or not so he started to do
that and fortunately I obviously was
paying attention and absorbing every bit
of it I kind of gave the impression that
I was uh not being focused for some
reason but strangely that changed my
equation with him at work you know he
suddenly started said to me how is it
that I thought you don't sort of pay
attention but you simply not seem to
know pretty much what's happening you
absorb very fast and so I said you know
I'm almost a
CA going to be a CA in one year
obviously there has to be some advantage
to
that uh that kind of was very reassuring
to him you know he just said that I just
feel that I had no idea that you um
learn so quickly and which was a huge
thing for me at that point in my career
where my father was this huge almost
like a monster the first year that I
worked with
him
um so that that was a huge shot in the
arm I think compl in my CA was a big
thing for me I the last 6 months uhu I
got a job offer at every company that I
went to for for an audit mhm they just
knew me as Kumar and
uh you know uh that was reassuring my
father got started to get a little
worried I thought mhm uh you know sort
of a lier way but all of those things
were positive uh you know positive
signals to me I grew in my confidence
because of that college uh I couldn't
really get to because I was either for
two years I was auditing the whole day
MH part of the ca so every every CA
Charter and every end of every term I'd
be outside the staff room and
blacklisted and call your parents and
all of that I said I'm doing my CA i'
said that to you when I took admission
I'm not there's no way I'm calling my
parents if you really really want want
me to do that you give me my TC and I'm
out of your TC's transfer certificate MH
uh so this drama went on almost for
three years unfortunately MH uh they
also kept saying but we want to have you
because you know it's such a matter of
Pride that one of our students is going
to complete his CA along with graduation
but they also gave me this sort of uh
tough deal after every uh uh kind of
term my father wanted me to attend work
and be with him so it was quite a you
know at the same time I was auditing
outside films you know every now and
then I remember three three months four
months of going my train uh to gandhali
for an audit so life there was lots of
things
happening um quite
overwhelming but you know um I had a
deep sense that this is all going to
work well for me mhm so I'd kind of
given up uh with with my dad on the
professional front I figured that you
know he has it sorted out and thought
out much better than I could have ever
done so let me just follow what he says
however tough it might be and it was
very tough but I'm so grateful for that
in retrospect because as things turned
out he passed away very early and I had
a lot of responsibilities to take care
of uh but yeah interesting time um but
very tough lot of hard
work and I don't think I've looked back
in the sense that I think I worked hard
pretty much every day since
then other than when I'm on a holiday I
think that's pretty much
of sort of bulwark of the the kind of
person I am I've seen that growing up I
had three generations before me going to
work every day intensely involved father
and grandfather and great-grandfather
and after that first initial years and
just after I graduated and my CA I think
something that uh has stayed with me
is uh the work the fact that there
really is no substitute for hard work
for smart hard
work and I think that's a work ethic
that I picked up from uh my family and
feel very grateful to that for
that um yeah so it was a defining period
of time for me
how was it back then um I'm picturing 85
886 pre liberal
India you a 18-year-old man going to
work with his
father like paint a picture of your day
back then where was office what was the
scale of
office what did it mean when you when
you go to work how did the employees of
the office look at you can you throw
some some light I'm just trying to put a
picture to
it so um I was like an intern other than
the fact that I was the owner
son uh so I had the opportunity and
privilege to sit right next to him uh
and uh like I said it was like a
realtime MBA because you know I I saw
him handling tough situations I saw him
conduct an AGM I saw him fighting
someone I saw him hiring some good
people uh you know attend to government
issues that kind of exposure is
something that you'd get over a period
of time in your career so this was
actually quite encapsulated because I
think he knew somewhere that he he was
running out of time mhm and therefore he
created this kind of uh encapsulated
module for me to learn the different
aspects of running a
business uh so I was growing uh
personally professionally
it was a time of stress uh you know I I
I think very few would be able to take
that kind of pressure but you know like
I said uh I knew deep down that despite
all the pain it was well worth it MH uh
I was learning I was in a very
steep uh learning curve uh I couldn't
have learned all of that sitting in
college um I also worked for a year on
the shop floor in a textile mill which
was quite fascinating I wanted to
understand about controls Financial
controls how manufacturing Works how uh
you know how uh you run a manufacturing
business right this was it grass this
was at Century textiles that my
grandfather owned and and ran right at
the time now we've come
to Nickel when I'm last year of college
from 22 23 20 20 mhm years of age mhm uh
so that's a lot of stuff happening mhm
for a 20-year-old a lot of my friends
had uh you know I mean they
didn't uh they weren't pushed um the the
way I was being pushed so they had a lot
of free time they
were having a good time generally and
that did pinch you at times but they
were very accommodating and
you know adjusted things to so that I
could be a part of
it um yeah so it was quite painful but
huge uh uh learning opportunity in some
ways do you have friends from back in
the day who are still friends oh of
course I have three friends from back in
the day who I'm in touch with on a
regular
basis uh and thank God for that because
they such a huge support each in their
own way mhm um you can be pretty much
yourself I mean there are people who are
know their friends from school and
college um we can give them a shout
out they know exactly who they are that
I'm talking about
them um so yeah and that that's a very
important part of uh you know just
having casual friendships from your
school and college days no strings
attached uh
complete
honesty you know fight sometime disagree
vly with each other we don't discuss
work uh not their work not my work it's
all about everything other than work but
we've been through a lot of ups and
downs in life together mhm which
obviously makes uh bonds much closer I
think it's very important having friends
uh where it's a friendship that's not
really seeking anything mhm uh makes
life uh that much richer
please what about you I'm going to have
[Music]
to what do we start with I have my
favorite sub here which is Bindy yeah
and I can I can go for days on end with
having just Bindy and paneer really what
is like a typical day of food for
you I have uh small meals spread out
through the day I'm uh not someone who
loves food it's more eat to live kind of
a
thing uh chocolate is something
that you know have sweet tools
especially with favorite chocolate keeps
changing I mean it's there's nothing
right now something anything pretty
practically anything these Cravings
happen after dinner
uh so you almost start to feel like the
workout I did didn't wasn't worth it
because everything's burnt up in
calories yeah but I'm I'm a pretty
Frugal eater uh yeah yeah not not too
fasty about what about you
uh so I like more
protein fiber less carb kind of
food today I burnt the top part of my
mouth cuz my cook was getting engaged
this morning and he was on a holiday so
I make this particular dish which I make
whenever I have to cook South Indian
dish no it's like boiled rice with
vegetables and chicken and no Masala
very simple it's one pot you put some
chicken you put some vegetables you put
some rice you maybe add like some pepper
and a couple of spices and you just eat
it it's really clean food h
makes you feel like great after eating
it so it's got proteins and carbs
both in no
Masala or oil or anything like
that so you
burnt you had it while it was too hot
yeah I ate it off the Stull trying to
taste if it's
good and I burned not my tongue but the
upper part of my mouth
[Music]
so Bindy and paneer for dinner and
breakfast is breakfast is a toag
omelette
um followed by soup sometime around
12:00 lunch um it's pretty simple I
think it's best to keep food
simple meals by yourself
I I reach home pretty late
after work and a workout
mhm so everyone else has eaten by then
mhm but you know all of us are around so
I'm eating by myself but the family is
around are you it's unlike the way it
was at our time when everyone ate
together can't be like that are you late
to bed wake up late kind of
BU I don't sleep too much in just five 5
to 6 hours so
I sleep quite late 1 1:30 wake up about
7:30 um
yeah typical weekend what
happens Saturdays I work till 5:00
mhm weekends typically is for the kids
and sometime
[Music]
M uh as the kids have grown older the
last few years in in particular this
they start they have their own program
right they have their own
plans
um so interesting in a way it gives you
more time to
yourself yeah there's nothing there's no
nothing that's um f in stone at all what
age is that when kids don't want to hang
out with their parents and they want to
hang out with their friends 15
16 does it begin then I think
so I mean each child is different
but I think it's also important for them
to you know have their own group
of friends and you know sort of not hang
out with parents all the time his son
did very well at Cricket didn't
he something he will pursue even in the
the Future No so
he he played professional Cricket for
seven
years uh after he played ranji he
decided to give it up
because all his decision to get into it
to get out of it mhm because he felt
that staying on would mean a lot more
commitment in terms of time MH and
eventually he wanted to get into work
mhm so he worked with me for four years
mhm uh he's now doing is MBA at Howard
mhm finishes in main
mhm yeah but he
had I can see that um there's a lot of
learnings that he's carried from his
days uh playing Cricket yeah attention
span ability to deal with all kinds of
people on time always running meetings
on time the day very
disciplined
um yeah so I think it's shaped him well
as an
individual do you think sport helps
business Sports help business in the
sense that if you're good at a sport
it'll give you an added Edge when you
come to the corporate
world again I think it's very person
specific n i mean you can't generalize
in his case it really did uh I'm sure
sure he would have picked up some of
these qualities even otherwise but I
think playing professionally for 6 seven
years traveling all over the country MH
second class non AC train I mean he
wouldn't need to do that right if he
wasn't playing some I mean wasn't in a
spot like
it um staying in sort of back of the
Beyond places mhm
uh you know sort of being with people
are very different m in terms of the
backgrounds from him most wouldn't even
speak
Hindi but he you know made some good
friends I think that that was a huge
learning for for him started off when he
did serving drinks you know uh to the
players and then went on to play ranji
so it was quite an experience for him
very enriching I could
see did you never consider buying a IPL
team no no
because do you like sport do you like
watching Cricket yeah I mean not Cricket
in particular I'm not particularly a
good Sportsman MH I couldn't understand
the model of the for the
longest um it's about Capital allocation
as well right I
mean when you have a lot of interesting
opportunities before you you got to make
choices mhm I'm not the sort of person
nor is my family or my son kind of
person who would say because I've been a
cricketer let's buy an IPL
team mhm doesn't work like that any
sport you like outside of
cricket so I've been a I've played
different sports at different points in
time but never really pursued anything
unfortunately the last I spent the most
time on shooting
mhm um and I thought i' play at least
some kind of competitive level didn't
get to that not been shooting for the
last two years because of a shoulder
injury mhm but that's something that I
find very
interesting so my
uh track so to speak is 10 m um pistol
mhm and it just is so exciting I mean it
just takes your mind away it's
gives you feedback MH as to how good a
man you are which I think is quite
important to me that's the reason why I
like the sport but I think it's
just just something you really
enjoy so tomorrow if the world
were finding a more dystopian version of
itself you'd be good with a
gun my God if need be
H it's not like
uh I'm spending a lot of Mind space or
time on it MH it's something that I
enjoy doing and I'm go to the range
every now and then again there's there's
no regularity to it mhm so no it's not
it's not that kind of passion MH but I
really enjoy it when I'm out there are
you on social media no no you are a lot
on social media H what made you get on
to it not very active I would post
something maybe once in 10 days or
something like that
MH not much about my personal life
really so the objective is
what the objective is getting more
distribution more distribution in what
way the more number of people who follow
you or who are looking at what you're
saying is more I'm not giving you the
like superficial answer but the real
answer is it gives you more
influence over a wider SE of
society and what do you want to do with
that
influence I mean that's a very positive
thing but yeah how do you look get it I
don't know exactly what yet
but if I feel like something has to
change in society it gives me a good
mouthpiece to say these contrarian
things
that maybe I think need to be said and
other people are not saying
it yeah I do get into trouble for saying
it and I constantly change my mind about
everything I go to the extent of
thinking that authenticity itself is
transient my authentic self today is
going to be different from my authentic
self
tomorrow so I do get called out for
changing as often as I do but I feel
like I was saying earlier I think that
change is necessary for evolution if I
were to this change changing all the
time just
being irrational or it's changing
because you have evolved grown and
therefore you have a different point of
view changing because you have more
evidence at hand and
now the pluses and minuses Stack Up on
the other
side but that's true for most people
right with new experiences your
perspectives change
is there something that you believed in
and committed
to very strongly that you no longer
believe in something from when you were
younger no I don't think um I there's
nothing I can call
out is there something on that for you
what sort of thing would would you be
referring
to even something like
a economic po policy there might have
been
times back in the day when I spoke
for benevolent capitalism maybe being
stretched as far as being known to be
socialist now it doesn't make sense to
me at some point it felt like
the right thing for society to what what
made you change your point of view I
think just
research your own experiences maybe yeah
I feel like in
a in a family you can be communist
almost if it's your
family with a group of friends you can
be
socialist but as the group becomes wider
I don't think socialism works because
trust Factor Falls very quickly we don't
trust people inherently that we do not
know that we do not know yeah or have
never
seen so socialism can work for 10 people
but I don't know if it can work for
10,000 what makes you think about
this I'm really intrigued as to what why
would you think about this there is
something obviously there's something
underlying that makes you want to know
more about this I feel like the most
interesting question in
life is to figure out why we are how how
we are like individuals individuals
extrapolated down to society I feel like
I have no clue why I want what I want
why I do what I
do a large part is it to conform but
outside of
that why did I become the
person who thinks say he wants to do a
or C I have no
idea it comes from some interest in
Psychology and philosophy one of the two
when you go back to your childhood for
example MH you don't see any strains of
connect with what you've done
professional
mhm nothing if I was 14 years old and
you asked me what do I want to become
when I grow up I said the most
conformist thing of the time which in my
vintage was I want to be a astronaut or
a pilot or something like
that but I I
can't I can't paint a bridge from then
to now why would that bother you though
but it doesn't really bother
me if I were to leave my profession and
all of that aside and think
of very innately what I want as a person
like if you would ask me
nikil you're 38 today what do you want
from
Life why why are you the way you are
today it feels like a interesting thing
to ponder about spend some time dwelling
on what made me the way I am and I think
that's all psychology
essentially every School of Psychology
you think about more from the point of
view of shaping your future or no why do
you think about it just understanding
the
present I don't think I can ever shape
my future or
change something about me that already
exists
um if I'm Petty I'm going to remain
Petty if I'm jealous I'm going to remain
jealous if I'm insecure I'm going to
remain insecure why do you feel that I
mean people do change right
circumstances change people new
exposures change people I feel like if
it's a mask you can change it inherently
if that's a trait in you I think it's
hard to change I don't want to change
anything I I don't want the
contradiction of having to make an
effort and
saying I was petty I must not be Petty I
don't want to make that effort and I
don't think I
can but I just want awareness of why I
am Petty and how I got to be
Petty yeah what would you do with that
nothing just
know yeah
just the
awareness I don't think there's anything
I can do with is there is there a
learning for the future
or what Would You Do Do by just what
Would You Do by just knowing I think I
would just
understand life a little bit better if
I'm able to figure out why I am the way
I am will just give me a little bit more
understanding about life and I think
that's all I'm hoping for um it's a
really big question for me actually
which is why I am the way I am these are
interesting questions that I don't know
if I'll ever have the answer to but I
can ponder
about yeah you're a very introspective
person nikol I mean it's I'm quite
amazed at how many things you think so
deeply
about is that something that's that
you've always
done or is it something that it's a
trait that you picked up from no I've
always so is that
just you enjoy being doing that enjoy
doing it I think yeah uh not like I
found any answers I probably have more
questions than I began with
but it keeps me
occupied you have uh lots of things on
the work front right to keep you
occupied yeah where do you get the time
to think so deeply about so many
different things I have enough time I've
realized that
most of what I
do is pretend to work I had this
conversation with
somebody at some point of time it's
likely different for a lot of people but
one day I was sitting in my office and
having this conversation with some C EXO
of our company and my brother and a
couple other guys and we all started
saying this one after the other one is
like okay I pretend to work work X hours
a
day out of the insecurity of knowing
you're sitting in front of me and
pretending to
work I don't think I do productive work
for more than quite complex maybe like
90 minutes a day and that would be
pushing it the rest of the time is very
repetitive work and if I were to ask
myself the question that I'm
excusing my Persona from that situation
how much would change the answer most
often that comes back to me is not much
not much would change if if I was not
there for very many things is that
because the business has got to groove
and no doesn't require so much of your
attention and no no it's not it's not
that I feel like I feel like there are
smarter people out there who
are better positioned to make many of
the decisions I make that than me and it
is my ego which has gotten swollen up by
virtue of the accidents in life and has
gotten me to this point where you know
everybody like we're not like you guys I
mean you guys are 100 times bigger but
even at my
scale invariably you get surrounded by
so many yes men that sounds like U
you're ready to start a new business you
think yeah
is that true
no
no it just sounds like I think
um I don't know what I want but I know a
little bit more about what I don't want
in terms of
work I don't want to waste any more of
my life pretending to work the
productive work that I do I will
do and the rest of the time I can
utilize in learning and reading and
exploring and doing things I actually
cherish
doing so thing you see you're pretending
to work for whose benefit nobody's
benefit
but for the insecurity of when you're in
an ecosystem say there's four of you
sitting together
because the other three are pretending
I'm also
pretending and I feel like a lot of the
world is going to go there with all the
evolution that's happening in
Tech I think most people will be
pretending to work a lot more than they
were pretending to work
yesterday because of social media
because of also Tech making their
jobs far more efficient if they so
choose to utilize it that's quite U
unfortunate don't you think so much of
pretend and pretend about working when
you can do so many better things in that
same time but I think that's been
Society from the beginning of time I
feel like in that
hierarchy every manager does le lesser
than the people he manages and every
manager's manager does lesser it's
actually like inversely proportional to
the reward they get for the
work could be because they've grown up
up the ladder right so they've
been uh in a situation
where their subordinates were or
are and they've gone through that
riger that's quite possible I think so
have you is your work pretty close to
where you live or your office yeah it's
not
far I guess that's a way to walk around
the situation right yeah yeah
we can have that I think you like dark
chocolate
yeah okay so we were
at you started
interning
uh we go back there and then what
happened
next uh we're in the year 86 887
something like that yeah I
think yeah so I'm working with my father
uh
uh complete my graduation and my
CA
um uh you know it's it's it's a lot of
work um but good work I mean it's good
you get wrapped on the knuckles once in
a way but
you learn to sort of accept that as a
way of life also you know the
intent uh is
right I also start looking at some of
the units
independently and I feel a great sense
of almost like gratitude because uh all
my friends I mean their fathers treated
them like they were nothing on
Earth um and if I got uh the opportunity
to have independent charge of fertilizer
unit and a cement
unit uh that really meant a lot that was
huge learning
MH um different time I mean my father
and I would
sit at the end of every month and he
would analyze or want me to analyze all
the breakdowns that happened in the
three four cement plants that we had was
quite painful but it was relevant
because at that time you sold what you
made
right there wasn't anything any other
variable that was
important but uh it us be very boring
and I used to think to myself you know I
want to have so many kills
that Papa can't asked me to be doing
this every month was just such
uh boring thing to
do
uh but yeah it was like I said steep
learning
curve um
I got married in
'89
um went off to my MBA after that at at
London Business School which was uh
again huge uh learning and very
transformational in some ways there was
post marriage that was post
marriage it says that you only met your
wife three or four times pre-
marriage yeah I mean that's what
uh that's how it happened
then twice not even three or four times
yeah so it quite tough on both of us
sorry isn't that really awkward to it
really
is but uh you know at that time in our
community for sure that's how things
that's how uh you know marriages
happen that was just a norm
and you just uh
kind of flowed with the
tide okay and then you went off to
college in London went to college um
studied business no l London Business
School
mhm good two years great learning met a
lot of different kinds of people from
across the world come
back uh in another couple of years my
father got detected with cancer and then
passed away soon after that so life
changed quite Dr alone or like with
family back then to
college me with family like with wife
with wife uh we were together when I was
studying so came back dad was
Ill immediately joined the business I
was in any case working completely with
him right even when were in college not
in college you know but you know it was
just the natural thing to do uh
come back and join him mhm and pick up
you know sort of start off from where I
left and is
there a part of the business that you
joined first well cut my teeth in
textile like I said spent in uh spent a
year on the top on the shop floor mhm
uh I just felt that it's the most
complex business that you could be in at
that point in time and therefore it
would be the best Lear around for me mhm
most other businesses were easier to
understand and run as compared to
textiles then mhm um cement was the
other business that uh you know uh I was
exposed to ran a
unit uh chemicals business costic soda
put up a plant and I say plant it was a
small plant but uh you know leadership
experiences so
invaluable uh dealing with people people
with
uh all very new for me right mhm bit
like being Alison Wonderland
almost was that the only game in town
back then cuz even when I read say your
peer group stories like a Reliance and
all of them everybody did textiles in
that era that was the biggest business
in India that was one of the biggest
businesses yeah in the'80s
'
80s maybe up part of the early 90s as
well until India opened up correct and
how did it feel living in that India
like I've read about it I was too young
to be cognizant to it uh I must have
been like five six years old in 91 how
did it feel what changed on the
ground I was quite absorbed with I was
doing with what I was doing actually Nik
so you didn't know any
better uh it's when India started to
open up to the world and when you say
open up can you elaborate what happened
when you say open
upz so tariffs started to come down you
had uh foreign investors coming into the
market in India and investing in your
company therefore for investor
expectations were different because
their profile was very different you
know it was much more competitive
tariffs came down in India you had
competition literally MH uh at the back
door mhm uh therefore the
whole dynamic of running a business
changed you had to think about strategy
about people needed new kind of talent
so it was quite a met metam offices at
that point in time
mhm and did you get an investor into
your
business um no when I say investor I
mean they they were also investing
through the market right so the profile
of investors mhm who were invested in
your company mhm you didn't have private
Equity really back then the way you have
it
now um but when you have a different
investor pool investing in the company
then you know investor
expectations start to change become more
accountable investors become more vocal
what do you think of private equity and
Venture Capital today it's very
prevalent in my world the startup world
of today I I I think it's a very
credible way of U building assets or
building um businesses a different world
quite different
from
uh the world of business that I'm in so
to speak it requires a different kind of
uh skill set almost mhm um but yeah I
think it's a huge source of equity today
and capital and it's a very incedible
way to grow a
business do you think private equity and
Venture funds today are a bit like
the money lenders and zamindars of
yesterday I don't think so no um crazy
why would you connect the two when I
think about it I feel like that I mean I
do a little bit of both of those things
but whenever a private Equity Vena
invests into your company they have
terms which means that in case of
liquidation they get their money
first uh different Clauses
that make you share your upside uh you
know there's Venture debt and a whole
bunch of like nuances there
but in many ways it feels like somebody
who made money
somewhere in case of p and Venture it
might be like I don't know LP sitting
out of America it might be some
endowment fund it might be some pension
fund
money coming from somewhere finding a
higher rate of return there's a lot
of commonalities between that and how a
money lender of yester Year's worked
right but you sign up to it right with
your eyes and ears open so it's fair as
you did with the money
lender I think that's bit of a harsh
view on private you've had a b bad
experience no no I
have I have we've never raised any
capital in anything
no I think it's uh a lot of it is about
chemistry also eventually I
think no I think you're taking a pretty
harsh view on
them yeah yeah no no I'm not being harsh
I feel like that they've serve a very
useful purpose of marketing the India
story outside of
India in order to bring foreign Capital
into India and it it has subsidized
consumption for a lot of people in India
we paid lesser for our taxis paid lesser
for food delivery paid lesser for so
many things and industries grew in India
but on their backs so I'm I'm not saying
it's a bad
thing I'm just
wondering if in a certain way even money
lenders yesterday did similar things I
mean there were atrocities happening
back then these guys are what they're
they're demanding
investors and like I said you pretty
much sign up to what they're expecting
right want to you you need to you need
to align uh
expectations um I mean but you know they
have their own you have the laws of the
land that govern them as well so if
you're signing up to an agreement
that's uh you know one-sided then that's
something that you're uh knowing me
siging up
to if you had one chance to redo life
today starting a fresh you're not Kumar
mangalam Bera but you're just Kumar
starting off and you have X amount of
capital let's say a million dollars what
business would you put the money in
today today I mean there are many of
them that that that's always a problem
that there's uh problem of Plenty one
difficult to uh pil down to one you're
making bets on pains and
jewelry jewelry retail
why so different reasons are pains
because you know the industry is moving
from being unorganized to more organized
real estate is looking up after covid
people want their own homes the nuclear
family setup in India is kind of giving
way to uh The Joint family setup is
giving way to nuclear
families uh aspirational Indian want
wants own home home is a sense of
achievement a sense of
Pride we also have an overlap with the
existing cement business in terms of uh
the dealership Network MH which is one
of the
key uh success factors required uh in
something like pains so all of that
gives us a right to win so to speak
jewelry retail because we've been in the
retail space for almost 25 years now so
we understand it fairly well but that's
apparel retail mhm uh so doing another
form of
retail uh is you know
logical you then go by empirical
evidence of which sector is doing well
and for what reason jewelry because
again it it it goes back to an
aspirational India people want to feel
good look good there's really only one
National level player you have a couple
emerging but uh um since one of the
objectives that we have very clearly
marked out for ourselves when we get
into a new business is that we want to
be uh in a leadership position which
means number one number
two at first number three the forcible
future uh it takes the sort of uh box on
that one as well still 95%
unorganized jewelry mhm I don't know the
percentage but it is something you it is
a sector that's only now becoming more
organized in the last few years I think
so that's an
opportunity anything it's also uh the
trust associated with the
brand um I'm quite surprised in the
first month we had a th000 people who
came with you know their gold jewelry
and exchanged it for stuff from our
stores which I thought was an
interesting
Insight uh so trust obviously plays a
very important role in this uh in this
business do you have an opinion on lab
grown diamonds and what's happening in
the diamond
Market not really I mean uh I know that
U uh the value of diamonds has gone gone
down by about 20% in the last one year
mhm uh which is you know quite quite a
quite
stock
um in India too jewelri doesn't seem to
be only uh investment class of asset
it's also just for aspirational and
for the Optics of it um which makes it
you know it's a different business than
what it would have been say even 10
years
ago but obviously there's a different
market for lapone diamonds and and it is
growing very fast from what I understand
it's not our space but it is something
that's going to uh you know take up some
demand
from you know retailers
of precious jewelry
it's something that you won't explore
not sure we just I think we first need
to uh consolidate here and it's always
an option what if a young entrepreneur
had lesser money like say one CR rupees
or two CR rupees and wanted to start a
business is there a industry you think
that has so much Tailwind that they
should really focus on so one CR is just
it's just not enough to start any
business today's conf
I'd rather just keep it in the bank what
if it was 10 and not
one I mean hypothetical but again not so
much that you can do I mean we're
talking about in India where you know
scale is important how much can you do
with 10
R you say what would you do with 10 R
me I can start a jewelry store with 10
jewelry store would be more than that I
think about 30 CR yeah like a large one
like a smaller one I
could depends on me depends on what's
the plan maybe a lab grown jewelry lab
grown gold low Value Jewelry yeah sure
that could be interesting right like try
to build a brand of
it then scale on the back of the brand
is that what you're suggesting yeah like
the novelty will be a brand in the
beginning right like if I can only make
jewelry which costs 50,000 Rupees and
lower and use lab grown and
gold maybe the affordability the one
thing I feel is broken in jewelry
stores
is whenever people go shopping it could
be a married couple it could be say a
father
daughter uh the experience of walking
into a jewelry store is very
overwhelming and D in cuzz often whoever
you're taking there to buy them
something can pick something that you
can't
afford so if there were a jewelry store
with a ceiling let's say for
example nothing costs more than one lakh
rupees almost like a dollar store but
like in a different way I feel the
experience of going in there and
shopping might
be less overwhelming but it can't be
sold like a budget thing so that's
almost like a zudio in the context of a
parel
yeah I would have to try it out quite
interesting right I think but it's a
different um business case Al together
yeah yeah
yeah anything else you think like advice
to young entrepreneurs what should they
do
now advise to young entrepreneurs uh do
what you love
doing uh keep the passion going get
together of a great team that's most
important I mean it's a team that
achieves you can be a good leader but
without a good team there's not much
that you can do you know uh being just
one single
person um I'd say
consistency learning agility is very
important there's so much of change in
the world today that to stay current and
TW TW twak your business model on the
basis of what's happening in the world
today how do you change like you did
like you went from textiles to cement to
like trying jewelry and pains today
these all like completely different
things uh even someone like us like you
know if we've been doing broking and
asset management for a bit or
lending we don't find it in ourself to
be able to change but people like you
intergenerational families who pivot so
easily what are you doing that we are
unable to do no I'm not sure you are
unable to do it it's just that you
haven't maybe reached uh that situation
it it is uh you know it does cause you
to stress need you to stress more
stretch more mhm but I think there's
also a sense of excitement around that
mhm so as India is growing up or grew up
mhm new spaces opened up for private
Enterprise right for example Financial
Services is a case in point mhm uh there
was a point in time I think around 95
97 when the
AMC mutual funds started to open up yeah
for private sector then
insurance that so you don't want to miss
that opportunity mhm
uh so on and so forth even with retail
at the end of the day there is is uh a
national a trend at at least National
level if not
International that you are hooking up
to um it's also a call on whether you
want to be a conglomerate or uh you know
one or two businesses and we took a call
very early on I did MH that we've grown
up being a conglomerate and we have
strengths in running different
businesses uh and doing that
successfully and that's what we'd like
the future parts to be like if I can ask
you a very personal question how do you
know it is the time to
Pivot what do you feel in a certain
business in a certain business I think
um uh you you have you get a sense that
now this m this business is mature
enough uh it's because you've been you
know you're sort of growing with the
business your own understanding uh of
the business you know gets deeper and
deeper it's it's a field it's an
instinct um I think an entrepreneurial
entrepreneurs instinct is is a huge
factor in this so when you feel a
business is mature enough you pivot and
you put your energy behind the new thing
and how does The Old Ship keep sailing
it's not always like that I mean that
makes it sound very mechanical but I
think that's that's uh you know that's
something
that uh even if it isn't in a
conglomerate
situation if you have mature businesses
that have sort of reached a cycle where
growth rates are tapering mhm you need
to invest in new engines of growth and
essentially that's model that we have
followed if you look back and
study there's no Brilliance you know
attached to it it's just just um common
business sense how do you step back back
and let somebody else Run The Old Ship
well not the old ship every ship because
like I was saying uh 180,000
people uh my daughter is involved in
some businesses my son as well but you
know for for the longest it's just been
me now with my kids so obviously it's
not a family run business it's basically
a people run business it's a people's
organization uh I think if you I mean
trust is a very important fact Factor uh
that there's something in your DNA which
must allow you to trust
people uh you also then U obviously need
to need to choose the right people and
there's some method there I think I
think if you have ambition like when I
in 95 when I started out I had ambition
and U I had limited limited experience
my father had just passed away and
logically the only way I could build
bandwidth and that stays true even today
was by getting people with more
experience on board and with different
talents that Talent skill sets that we
had in the
organization so I think it's also to do
with ambition and
passion uh if you want to
grow the only way to grow is to have
energized teams I mean there's
no uh you know there is no other way
out uh and that's the fundamental
principle on which we working I I feel
like I have a lot to learn from you in
this is there something you look for in
people when you're doing this pivot from
the people you're hiring is there
something in particular there's two two
kinds of people those who've grown up in
the organization so I have
about uh 4,000 people who've been with
me for 20 plus
years with people like that you know
them pretty much I I mean I don't I may
not know all of them but HR would all
the people in the system would so that's
that's you know being a meritocracy you
have a track record within the company
and meritocracy means that you're pretty
much getting ahead bases the Merit that
you've earned for yourself for people
from outside it's it's a gut feel you
look at their track record you speak to
them you you do sound referencing it's a
gut feel I mean do you think
I I look at people uh and I ask myself
can they handle
complexity uh are they agile
Learners uh and would they be able to
lead large and diverse teams of people
and that that sense you can only get
with uh talking to them right there's no
other way uh so I think more than just
uh referencing it's it's about your own
Instinct right your own own own uh uh
experience with uh different kinds of
profiles people mhm um so it is a leap
leap of faith at the end of the day
right they say that when people are on
their deathbed the things that they
often
regret are things like why did I work so
hard why did I worry about how I'm being
perceived uh why didn't I spend time
with my friends stuff like that what do
you think it will be for
you what would be the regret I mean and
I don't know uh to be honest N I don't
know if there are going to be regrets I
mean uh but I think that um especially
in the last 15 years I'd say I've lived
life quite thoughtfully U and I mean
life's been kind uh I've had more
challenges life has thrown me more uh
curve balls on the left side than
I can even sort of talk about it one can
anyone can could even
imagine but um you know there have been
so many things on the positive side as
well so one feels a sense of gratitude I
don't think at this point of time if I
was to die be on my death's P bed today
I don't think there's anything I'd
hugely regret I mean I've never had for
example a work life balance but that's
been by choice for for various reasons
right or wrong
it's not happened by default there have
been reasons behind it which to
me uh are logical well thought
through
um I I don't think that there is any
such regret I would have of course if I
have another 30 years to live at least
the situation might
change uh but yeah I mean God's been
kind I don't I don't have
any I mean regret would be for for
example I wish my father was there for
longer that's not something you regret
at the end of life I mean that's your
regret is about to do with life choices
that you have
made so I think so far it's gone
well nice I think that's it we've
covered all that we wanted to today
thank you for uh doing this oh it's been
interesting n you're doing uh a great uh
job of uh this and I know a lot of
people watch watch your podcasts
and you know I'm I'm sure draw
inspiration from them any fleeting words
to the many young entrepreneurs who will
be so inspired by watching this anything
that you want to tell them which is
nonobvious someone looking to I think
the power of uh
consistency the soft power of
consistency something that we don't
always uh value mhm uh and that's in my
experience very important as you grow in
your careers you start to realize that
it's good to know that early
on nice thank you so much for doing this
taking the time with us been a pleasure
thank you thanks guys thanks
