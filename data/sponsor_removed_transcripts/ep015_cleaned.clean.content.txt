I am thrilled to have on the show with
us Shrimati Smiti Irani.
>> 25 years ago I was called a part-time
politician and a full-time actor. My
father I said I'm going to live the rest
of my life as somebody's wife 17 years
as your daughter. I said when do I get
to live for myself? First job was on the
streets of Delhi in a place called
Janpat for 200 bucks a day. Taken a loan
from my dad. He said I'll give you one
year and if you can't pay me back marry
whoever I tell you to marry I would have
loved to be a fly on the wall in your
home. What is it like to be back as
Everywhere I would go, they would
say you're a crappy actor. Male actor
was getting paid more than me.
>> Tulsi today could say something to Tulsi
25 years ago.
>> Get a better paycheck.
>> In 2004, fought my first election. I was
27. There's no education, no academic
adventure. You understand hardcore
politics.
>> Have you ever felt that you had to to
choose between being liked or respected?
>> Very angry editor shouting on my phone,
Arus Swami, what is wrong with you? Come
out. out and you know
>> are politicians supposed to be good
diplomats
>> in this modern world you have to be your
own CEO CFO and intern
>> the portion tracker app
>> and that was me
>> exactly
>> 8 million children who are severely
acutely malnourished built it in one
month I was there in the opposition when
the Nirva case happened as somebody from
the BJP two men at the helm made sure
that the reservation happens for them
nobody knows this let me break the
biggest myth that's never happened in
the history of our
Indian women were among the first in the
world to exercise the right to vote well
before many western democracies actually
granted full suffrage to women. And in
India, we have had women um hold some of
the highest constitutional offices,
prime minister, president, governors,
chief ministers. Something even the
large democracies in the west have not
seen as yet. And yet at the same time,
when we look at true representation, the
numbers remain very limited. In our
parliament, take both Rajya Sabha and
Lok Sabha, women's representation hovers
around 14%. And when you look at the
state assemblies, it's even less, under
10%. And I personally think that we have
very few positive role models. And
today, we're very fortunate to have one
of those role models with us. Hello and
welcome to All About Her, a space where
we have honest and meaningful
conversations about women's health,
wellness, happiness, and self-care. And
today we will be discussing women in
public service. We are very, very
fortunate to have one of those role
models with us. And normally as you know
on the show we have the format of a
phenomenal woman and an expert who gives
us valuable insights. Today I'm excited
to tell you that we have our phenomenal
woman and expert rolled into one and I
am thrilled to have on the show with us
Shrimati Smiti Irani. Thank you so much.
>> Pleasure.
>> I'm so happy that you're here and I'm so
excited to have this conversation with
you and I have a bunch of questions
which I'm sure you've been asking. I
will fire away in the interest of time.
My first one is of course that you are
now back to acting and you've called
yourself a full-time politician
part-time actor. So what's it like in
your part-time job?
>> It's it's fascinating how life comes
full circle because 25 years ago I was
called a part-time politician and a
full-time actor.
>> And I think that when my political and
media journey began, I began my media
journey in the year 199596.
Now at that time I was what barely out
of high school and um it was not a very
very nice place for women to be in.
>> My father specifically asked me are you
a dud head and I said why? He said only
people who do not have enough capacity
to be academically inclined or to do
something better in a professional or
private sector would want to opt for
media. So if I have all the people would
you who's been surrounded with books
want to do anything in media
>> and within media it was journalism
>> I actually started uh from Delhi with
just the intention of wanting to live my
own space and my own life I was very uh
uh I think blunt with my family when I
told them I said particularly my father
I said I'm going to live the rest of my
life as somebody's wife I have lived a
good part of my 17 years as your
daughter I said when do I get to live
for myself it sounds very yash chopra
uh as though you know there's a DDL
scene and you know
but this was one of the um I think hard
facts about life. I decided that instead
of just beating around the bush the idea
was to have a straightup conversation.
Uh I think the tone with which I had
that conversation uh indicated to my
parents that this is the respect I show
them to hear their point of view but
this is something that I've already
decided for myself. In Delhi uh the
atmosphere was such that everybody knew
everybody and if you wanted to become
somebody you had your parents give you a
leg up.
>> Yes.
>> Um I come from a very very modest in
fact financially challenged background
and I knew that for me to become
something or somebody it was essential
that I do it on my own. Um there were
people around me who thought it was
quite foolish because it is not easy to
begin from scratch.
>> Were those family members or
>> I'm the first girl in the family
actually to go out and work and my
father in fact was flabbergasted. He
said you were absolutely all right till
now.
>> Um he I have two other sisters. He says,
"What am I to make of them?" Because
suddenly you're this rebel who wants to,
you know, uh, lead a professional life.
Because before that, I was this
introvert who would just read books all
day and never speak to anybody. I was
not the regular girl who would hang out
with other girls or have go to birthday
parties or even paint my nails for that
matter.
>> The first time I put my lipstick on was
when I was a MissIndia finalist.
>> So my father said, "Why on earth would
suddenly this change happen in this
girl?" But this is something that I had
contemplated over a period of time. Um,
and I think my grandfather, my nana's
death had a huge contribution to that
thought process. I had seen him uh live
through a phase where he was adamant
that will make something of herself
>> and everybody else in the family thought
that you know um he's being diffident
for no reason. He said he was very very
clear that this is not a girl who you
marry off to somebody.
>> Uh allow her to study, allow her to you
know carve out her place for herself.
There was talk about me sitting for UPSC
and my father said he said you don't
have the temperament to take orders from
anybody. And he said that it's not going
to be fruitful because my mother's side
of the family did have certain serving
officers in various vertical. My
grandfather had served in the navy. My
dad who died before I was born had
served in the Indian army
>> and he says you do not have the
temperament to take orders and uh that's
why I didn't set um set foot into any
academy to study for the UPSC exam. I
had a fire in my belly when I saw
journalists on television. I said I need
to do this. I landed up at a television
uh network's office uh 17 or 18 and and
they actually shooted me away. HR said
what's wrong with you? I mean you're a
kid. And I said, "No, no, I'm I need to
do something." The idea that drove me
>> was to do something where my parents had
the least bit of interference, had
absolutely no knowledge of nobody
>> and media was that space where they knew
nobody. So it became a very natural
choice for me.
>> And was there somebody that you took as
an influence? You said, "Okay, this is
my role model." No, I never had one of
those fancies.
>> I uh wanted to first work. So I my first
job was on the streets of Delhi in a
place called Janpat where I was selling
cosmetics for 200 bucks a day. That's
again around the age of 16 and a half
17. And uh from that I wanted to
basically
test my capacity. How hungry am I uh for
either a job or what is my ambition? And
I was in that space at that time. And I
think I predominantly grew up with my
grandfather. So there was this whole
patch of him dying and me left widdling
my thumbs wondering who
>> how old were you when he passed away?
>> I was like 13.
>> So those three years were very difficult
for me because suddenly you that whole
center of uh support goes
>> and as every teenager goes through that
whole churn. you feel that you know
there has to be somebody who validates
this crazy idea you have that I can be
independent
>> and the one person who could validate
that had passed away and um I think
after that selling cosmetics there was
this whole aha moment because there's a
lady who bought something from me and
she walked away and she came back she
said do you know why I bought this from
you I like no idea but thank you so much
she said no no no you know how to speak
you speak Well, so for me it was like oh
maybe I can get into marketing and
sales.
So I went I spoke to my father who's
running a career company and I said can
I work with you? So just to toughen me
up and just I think he basically wanted
to be wean me off the ambition.
>> He said fine you have to go to Naidali
railway station and go to Nidali Basada
and go to Gul Dakana and go to Palam
airport and with you know other men on
the job. I was one of the first three
women in the entire industry what 33 32
years ago and he says you need to do
this and I think he kept waiting for me
to say I give up I just didn't and I
would do those rounds um I would write
manifests I would take calls from you
know people who were hunting down where
the packages till one day I said which
is the toughest station now 32 years ago
Mumbai Bombay then was a tough nut to
crack because you had a union here
>> and New Bombay was an area which nobody
went to. I said I want to go there
without you know any parental support.
Uh I worked here. I set up offices here.
I set up my father's uh logistic system
here. And then I was I think um
audacious enough to tell him I need to
buy a part of your business in Bombay
out.
>> Wow.
>> And he just looked at me fine cough up
the money and I had none. So I thought
that if I am to work and at that
instance I realized that everybody said
I was successful because of my father's
daughter
and I felt that that would then be a
dead end for me
>> and nobody considered the fact that this
is a girl who has set foot in logistics
32 years ago
>> and I realized it would be you know
futile to just kind of keep going at it.
So I came back to Delhi and I think he
was relieved till I just quietly filled
uh you know the Miss India form.
>> I think I would have loved to be a fly
on the wall in your home.
>> No and I think I still remember that
phone call at the dining table. He was
seated. We had this place in Basan Kunch
the it was rented flat and the call came
and somebody else picked it up. They
said why is times of India calling? I
like it's for me and they're like why
would they call you and they just
wouldn't give me the phone because you
know there's a hierarchy in such
families which are conservative that why
should the girl take the phone and who
are you
>> and there was a lady on the other end
she said can I please speak to this girl
Satimalotra and they said but why they
know she's been selected they said but
for war god
>> uh we calling from feminis India and
there was a bombshell
and my father just lost it he was like
What? Why are you doing in a beauty
pageant? Have you looked at I think my
sisters started laughing because they
said
>> your sisters are younger than you.
>> Yeah, they're younger. But they just
started laughing. Everybody started
laughing. They said but you don't even
you know wear color coordinated clothes
>> and where's this just bunch up come from
>> and I said because you can't fix the
race. I said you can't fix the
competition. So he had an office
assistant and that office assistant was
told okay fine go and go with smiti she
will lose and get her back home
>> right
>> and I would do one round and she would
dutifully chal and I would pack my bag I
would go and times of India would run
after me no no no you've gone to the
next phase
>> and I like oh have I
>> right
>> and that happened quite often and the
assistant got fed up she just called my
father she's like I think so something
you know this kid is not feeling.
I still remember Praep Buha was alive
then. He was the person he said come
here kid and can you just stand and like
yeah and then he started talking to me
about current affairs.
>> Yeah.
>> I was like oh you have to answer
questions on news. So then I went
>> but that was my first kind of
introduction to media media.
>> Yeah. Because for me it was like oh all
you have to do is compete and your
talent will make you stand out
>> and then you should know things about
current affairs. That was my
>> mind space then till I landed in Mumbai
and I saw the pageant. I was like oh
okay current affairs. No.
>> Yeah.
>> But I think what it gave me was an
exposure that I never had before.
>> To be alone uh in a competitive uh world
where beauty mattered.
>> I also realized that that was not my cup
of tea. M
>> um the exhibitionism as a model was not
my cup of tea.
>> So
>> you wanted to do something that had more
>> I wanted to do something which had which
fueled me
>> and you need a certain discipline to
look good you know to present yourself I
had none of it and I think that
mercifully then I I had taken a loan
from my dad because he's like I mean
who's going to pay for this? I'm like
you are. He says fine but you have to
give the money back. Pay me back. So we
reached an understanding. I still
remember the night I lost. I called him
to say video washing machine. Now think
back. This is 1998.
>> A washing machine video con used to be
this glitzy ad. It was a big thing. I
said I've got this this this gift in the
pageant. And I said this is the total
value of it. So can we just I I actually
made him deduct it. And he humored me.
He said fine but you still have a huge
load of money to pay back. So I said no
I'll work. He said, "I'll give you one
year work and if you can't pay me back,
marry whoever I tell you to marry."
>> Wow. I have It's I would ask you so many
questions about whether you think this
was like the right motivation for you.
Was it like you know because that
relationship between father and daughter
is
>> I think you have to understand this is a
person my father was berieved when he
was a young what sevenyear-old kid
>> you know he himself uh saw
>> he lost his parents
>> and he was the youngest in his family so
he had nobody to kind of guide him or
show him the way
>> fell in love as a youngster with my
mother he was from the congress party my
mother's from the RSS so I was like this
had divorce written all over it and that
to in the emergency. You know, that's
the worst time. I like who falls in love
in the emergency people are getting, you
know, hassled. But I think he spoke from
his own insecurities. He didn't want to
be on the streets.
>> And you need to understand that about
parents. I think you also understand it
when you age yourself.
>> Of course, it takes a while to get
there.
>> Yeah, it it takes a while. But there was
some kind of an understanding because
I'd seen my parents go through that
whole phase and financially I'd seen
their struggle. So I and also there were
a lot of shadikarishtas from very very
um financially refined families
>> suitable.
>> So everybody in the family said why why
you making your life so difficult just
marry the right guy who has you know uh
the money to give you a comfortable
life. Now they are speaking from their
experience of having gone through
hardships
>> right
>> and uh to pay off that loan Bandra
linking road had the first McDonald's
ever that's where I worked
>> and even that job was so weird because
in churchgate in Mumbai um I finally got
fed up of doing the rounds of you know
Natra studio and all the studios of the
world where I wanted to get some acting
because I was told during the MissIndia
finals that you know you know how to
act. I'm like, "Acha."
He said, "No, you're comfortable with
the camera, so these two are like,
>> yeah." So I said, "Acha, so what do you
do when you act?" I said, "No, you can
do ads, right?"
>> Because I'm not going to do ram shows.
It just made me very uncomfortable.
>> So they said, "You act." And everywhere
I would go, they would say, "You're a
crappy actor."
>> So in auditions and all that.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's brutal, you
know. It's horrible.
>> And uh and I was just counting the days.
I didn't give a damn when people say oh
you bad I was like oh god I have one
year
>> and the clock is ticking away and I
realized I mean I had my last what
little money left I went to church I
said let's get a job because in between
jobs I'll go and audition and I still
remember there was a jet air the airline
company uh an ad out for flight
stewardous and I was like okay I'll do
this and it's got a good salary package
>> and there were many people in the acting
world who were doing post.
>> M
>> I went there, the guy just looked at me
and said, "You don't have the
personality." I said, "Okay." But
because I was waiting the whole day to
just have my turn at the interview, I
realized that the next door interview
was McDonald's. So, I went there and I
asked him, I said, "Do you have a job
left? I'd like to, you know, kind of
interview for it." And the person there
said that um I mean just the last rung
is left. I said, "What is that?" They
said, "Well, the person you know who
kind of mops the floor a little." I
said, "Do I get to say welcome to
McDonald's?" They said, "No." They said,
"That's the next rung." I said, "Ch,
what do you do in this rung?" So, they
said, "You clean the dishes and you swap
the floor
>> and maybe you know, you have that paper
um thing sheet that they put on the
tray. I did my job."
>> So, they say, "You get to do this." I
said, "How much is the money?" That was
like what? 1,600 1,500 bucks. But you
get a burger and you get the break. You
get the food. And I was like done.
>> Yeah.
>> Done. In between I will do that.
>> But this is all part of the bigger plan
which is to then presumably act.
>> No just a paycheck. Just pay my father
back.
>> Pay your father back.
>> Yeah. I had no such ambitions that I'll
be some Mina Kumari or
>> but financial independence. And you
understood financial independence means
the ability to make choices.
>> Financial independence. I think I just
wanted to succeed.
>> I was very clear. I'll be a success. Now
I had said this since I was 7 years old
and my mom was like what makes you think
that you know you're being so and I was
very acclusive or I'll be you know one
day watch me and she said how
>> I mean look at your circumstances I have
no idea.
>> Yeah
>> but they will talk about me. I still
remember when I first came to Mumbai, my
mom was with me and you know there's a
Kamlaneru park in town.
>> Yes.
>> And I went there's a shoe shaped thing
and the park and I thought that this is
I mean now if you look at it
retrospectively it's like this whole
Kate Wit moment in Thailand looking at
the whole queen's necklace and I said
one day this city will know me and my
mother would whacked me saying you know
you need to come back to reality why do
you think this will happen? I said I
have no idea
>> but it's so amazing that this can happen
you know that these these people a lot
of people think that these are dreams
that are have no legs
>> I was not ify about it I was very clear
>> yeah and then so much has happened since
then and that's what I started with to
say is that you have achieved so much um
and then of course
>> it doesn't feel like I've achieved much
it's like
now
question number 16
but this was just the beginning of what
is it like to be back as Tulusi. And is
the character does it does it have any
kind of I don't know if you're allowed
to say does it encapsulate some of your
evolution as a woman?
>> I always kept the character as close to
the real me as possible. Uh in terms of
the emotions or the stance or uh the
only difference is I told Mr. Irani that
you don't get as lucky as Mr. Virani
where if you cheat on me don't think
I'll sit there and you know do puja of
yours. That's not going to happen. Not
going to happen.
>> Yeah. But I think that in terms of
certain positions that the character
took uh tonality and all that I kept it
as close to reality as possible that in
a drama setup and soap opera
>> but 25 years old we did do stuff on
marital rape on domestic violence on
euthanasia adult literacy so it's not as
if we were regressive I was too busy
didn't have the time to defend it and it
was incumbent upon the production house
aa and that's who got you know kind of
um loaded with the that kind of a push
back. I think people don't realize that
what you see on screen if not for a
documentary is actually make believe
and I don't know why people think that
make believe has to be real
>> right
>> because if it was real people would not
watch it
>> right
>> um so there has been a segment in the
industry which has sold uh some scripts
in the guise of oh this is not make
believe this is very real which is
>> uh what has led to this kind of
division. I think for actors it was
always about whether a story or a
character makes sense in terms of the
reprise. I think what is important now
is the understanding that your audience
has changed
>> and the understanding that now the
medium has changed as well. 25 years ago
there was no OTT.
>> 25 years ago there was no 10:30 slot.
People went to sleep. So we kept them
awake. We created the slot. We made that
time prime time. That in itself was an
achievement. But do remember 25 years
ago to have a female producer was also
>> tough. Today movies talk about pay
parity. But 25 years ago we set that bar
there.
>> And when I came in as an actor, the male
actor was getting paid more than me.
>> But I was very conscious that okay, you
have to prove yourself. You're a new
kid. prove yourself and then make sure
that then your talent gathers that worth
financially from your production house
or the channel pays uh vice versa. So I
also left at the peak when I said it's
okay to very ambitiously and loudly say
I'm the highest paid because women were
always told don't talk about
>> don't flex that muscle.
>> Yeah.
>> And I was like hell with it.
>> Yeah. And uh today uh I'm still proud of
the fact that in terms of pay parity in
terms of female um production head or
producer uh on also how she's going to
create the character and the
circumstances around her. She will make
sure that it has a contemporary
reflection.
>> Do you get involved with like if you
feel like this character is seen talk
>> into the dialogues and writing?
>> Yeah. Yeah. I think that the best part
is that there's an understanding that
it's a partnership.
>> Um, and actors deliver best when there
is a sense of contributing to whatever
comes to you as a scene or as a story.
>> If you have somebody who is uh very
closed, then you don't give a brilliant
product.
>> Any product or any project where people
can work together including technicians.
There are times when I would ask uh an
assistant or a technician to say do you
think this sounds right? There are times
when you're using colloquial language. I
would actually go hunt for those people
in my in my technical team to say I one
of you are you from that background? can
we sit and you know kind of they would
get involved right
>> and I think that's what determined our
success that we didn't get siloed into
our roles um marketing programminguling
makeup technician camera everybody would
talk to each other
>> and you bring your real experiences to
the
>> you do and that's how you we stayed
consistently number one for 8 years
>> we touched a TRP of 31 which is unheard
of
>> but we did that because none of us
>> were very um I think entrenched in the
fame part of it.
>> Yeah,
>> we were very proud of the product that
we were giving. We were proud of the
legacy that we were creating. Very
focused from that perspective.
>> So now how will you manage your time
between your part-time and your
full-time job?
>> I was always I mean at that time I was
doing not only politics I was raising a
family a young one. Now the nest is
empty. So it's not as if you know I have
crying babies to feed. Um politics is
something which is a service. M
>> it's not a post it's a way of life
>> you can't say I'm off duty right now I
mean I'm in Mumbai right now so if I
find somebody who says t I want xyz done
can you help I can't say no sorry I'll
go back and go to my station and see
whether I can help there I can't help
you so I will get calls to say
yeah I I would get a call from and
Yeah. So as a politician I've seen the
whole expanse. You would sit with
colleagues to say even if they're from
the opposing party that fine we want to
do some research. Do you think this is
you know something that you have some
research on. So it's a 24/7 thing. uh
but they are politicians who are
academicians who are journalists uh who
are in the private sector and we get to
our jobs the only difference is that I
have a camera on me that's it
>> the transition
was that also something that you planned
to I mean of course you must have
planned it when you decided to join
politics
>> I joined politics in 2003 formally
>> like you said okay now I with this bang
I can say that I the highest paid actor
and this this is a comfortable
no to something else. No, no, no. I was
the US aid who WHO ambassador to India
uh between the year 2000
to 2002 which meant that when you're
working with the WH I was working on
child and women's health. You cannot
take a political office and make it all
political because you have to work
across all verticals and irrespective of
ideologies with everybody. you speak for
the woman, for the child, you speak on
health, you speak on behalf of WH, so
you cannot get your political ideologies
involved because I thought it was not a
kosher thing to do.
>> And when I finished my stint with the
WHO, um I had the privilege of
introducing OS with zinc in our country.
At that time, what every year five lakh
children were dying
>> because of just bad water, because of
diarrhea. So my focus was very clear
that can I contribute to stemming this?
Can I create more awareness about it? In
fact, WH and the government posted which
is a Congress government. They actually
did a study on it
>> and it was found that yes beneficial
impact was seen because you have to
inform people that the solution is very
readily and easily available.
>> So after that in 2003 is when I formally
joined politics. I was also in this
Maharashtra belt in Talasuri uh Dhanu uh
working on village water projects. So
whatever I would make as an actor part
of it would go to do water projects in
certain villages
>> and those are knackel affected belt
>> right
>> and I had the late goat Mundai he told
me he said you can keep doing any amount
of social work but what is the
penultimate goal I said the penultimate
goal is to make a difference possibly
through policy he said then you have to
be a part of electoral politics
>> and that's when I became a part of
politics politics uh the BJP And do you
think you being a recognizable face was
an asset or was it in any way?
>> A horrible disadvantage.
>> A disadvantage
>> because everybody presume actors have
presented themselves as though politics
is the last thing that they do. It's not
something that they progressively do
well at the peak of their career.
>> Uh it's not something where they go to
the grassroots and work through the
grassroots all the way up. Most actors
are parachuted because of their
popularity
>> and then they'll just become a Raja
Sabha.
>> Yeah. I was not one of those. So when I
came to active politics in 2003, I was a
youthwing member of the BJP in
Maharashtra. My bachmate today is the CM
of Maharashtra and my other colleague
the president is the minister of
education now Dhindrahan. But even that
time I remember my colleague actor
there's a serious political position. I
wanted to be in the trenches with my
colleague and gained their respect
because I knew that I was in it for the
long haul and I worked my way uh through
grassroot uh work then became the state
secretary in Maharashtra when Nathan
Gutkari became president. I have worked
with five BJP presidents um Rajnat Singh
G Nit Gadkari Amit Sha JP Nandanda and
at that time Benuji was the uh president
of BJP. I in 2004 fought my first
election. I was 27.
>> So I can very safely say been there,
done that. Yeah.
>> There's so many um you know questions.
For example, if somebody wanted to
become a leader in politics, a young
girl um I wanted to ask if they are like
you said you um were drawn to this. You
were introduced to uh developmental work
as an actor and then you
>> I was not introduced
>> like nothing that I picked
>> really. Okay.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I picked
>> it's not how because you know
>> because then you get to see the expanse
of your country. You get to see the
health systems very up you know up close
>> right
>> I don't I think people think politics
will happen to them
>> right
>> you have to happen to politics
>> right
>> it has to be the other way around. And
is are there things that you would
advise people um to do as stepping
stones in terms of
>> there is no framework which says do cut
cut
>> like if you do this course if you do
this kind of education if you meet the
right
>> there's no education
>> work at the level
>> there's no education no academic
adventure you can undertake
>> to understand hardcore politics
>> for that you have to first understand
what is the ideology that you'd like to
uphold what is your framework
>> of contribution. You have to have that
conversation with yourself first. For
that you need to understand that you
will never know everything.
>> You have to be a constant learner.
>> The other aspect is people think that oh
I'll meet XYZ person who's a current
leader and then become a politician.
Doesn't happen.
>> It's a very tough job.
you are available on phone uh or
available in person 24/7 because people
don't come to you for entertainment.
>> Yeah,
>> they're genuinely stuck on some issue.
Nobody has the time for another human
being,
>> let alone a politician. The only time
they'll approach a politician is if
they're genuinely desperately in need of
support,
>> right? Do you turn away people at that
time saying you can't
>> some might
>> then they don't last that long because
politics and especially politics in this
country is a matter of service we have
to be extremely grateful to get the
opportunity to serve I've had the
opportunity to serve three times
>> that's a privilege in a country of 1.4 4
billion people. It's a privilege and you
should know it's a privilege and then
respond to your parliamentary or
constitutional duties accordingly. I I
knew what a great privilege it is.
>> When you joined in 2003, do you think um
of course you said for example it wasn't
certainly wasn't an asset uh being who
you were
>> because many actors before me had not
conducted themselves as though they were
worthy right
>> of the privilege that they got. Very
rare. as a woman. Um I want you to
understand
>> bad enough that you're an actor.
>> The woman is a double whammy, then
you're young also. So
>> yeah. So I was going to say the
challenges of being young, inexperienced
um a woman, an actress, you know, um did
those were there any instances um that
you found challenging because of that?
Any instances of sexism or people
saying, "Oh, not being taken seriously?"
There is this huge conversation around
media and politics as though they are
the falcrum of sexist
>> behavior. Neither in media nor in
politics have I faced that
>> right
>> I don't know there's something about
maybe my disposition
but even when I was a nobody in the
media business and I think not many
people know that I even had a stint as a
stringer as a as a journalist
>> I never faced it
>> so I don't know whether it's something
of a vibe that I give off
>> it's interesting to know because you
know um it is something as you said
people generally assume that in this
male-dominated world, this young person
will come and will be
>> perhaps attacked in all these different
ways.
>> I think the attack against me where an
attack is sexualized happened when I
became ministered. It happened before
that. The opposition and especially
people who want to curry favors with
let's say an opposition leader would
have very vile attacks on me. But by
then you're so experienced. So I mean
I'd spent 20 years I like it's being
done to distract it has been done to
reduce your work. So you need to be
smart enough to respond to it.
>> Yeah. Have you ever felt that you had to
choose a time where for example you had
to choose between being liked or
respected? Did something like that?
>> I've never made that choice.
>> I don't think that I have ever given
validation from another human being that
much of importance.
I know how futile that is.
>> Yeah.
>> Be it politics or my personal life, I
have never sought validation.
>> Who in your family are you like?
>> Nobody.
>> Like who else? But where does where does
where does it come from?
>> Everybody's asking me that. Nobody. I'm
like nobody in my family.
>> Do you think it came from just
>> being exposed to you think when you're
alone as a kid? No. No. I think when
you're alone as a kid and like I said to
lose my grandfather must have been one
of those moments where I realized that
if I'm so dependent on just his presence
>> just that pat on the back and he's gone
so I have the rest of my life so I I'm
attuned to thinking like this that oh
okay there's nobody
>> so do you wait for that somebody to come
along because then your life is about
that weight
>> right
>> somebody very and an economist in fact
dare I say has said this that in this
modern world you have to be your own CEO
CF1 one intern,
>> right?
>> I think I realized that when I was a
kid.
>> Yeah, there were some people who said
that your style, your way of talking
came across as arrogant. Now I feel like
I wanted to say do of course we are all
used to people saying anything. There's
freedom of speech. You read your
comments on Twitter, on Instagram. Uh I
don't know whether negative comments get
to you or not.
>> No, I see everything. Every word, every
word. But I don't uh in any way deny
them that space. I'm very blunt.
>> Yeah. which is not
something which is celebrated when
you're a politician.
>> Yeah.
>> Even in the media business, you're
supposed to be nice enough to never
speak the truth.
>> Are politicians supposed to be good
diplomats? Like if it's are you supposed
to be diplomatic?
>> The question should be is being
diplomatic helping the constituency and
the country.
>> If it does, by all means be that. when
we go internationally to present
ourselves, can we be abrasive
>> in the face of vicious attacks
>> uh diplomatically so on our country? No,
you have to be smart on your feet and
kind of weave your way around it.
>> So it depends on what job has been
assigned to you. So if I am representing
my country and somebody who meets me is
not very kind, I have to think what is
the cost my country will bear if I do
not behave appropriately and
diplomatically. So
>> 2019 was a big deal.
>> My whole life has been a big deal.
>> Your life is a big deal. But I'm saying
having joined politics for the world it
was a big deal. No, I was very clear. If
anybody picks up any of my interviews
between 2014 and 19, there was this
choices with which I said, "Oh, I'll win
19." And if you pick any interview of
mine between 2019 and 24, you will only
hear me say, "Well, whoever is getting
the seat from the BJP in Amatei, they
will do the best and try and beat
Congress." I never spoke about I will do
this between 19 and 24. But I was very
vehement about what I said between 14
and 19.
>> What do you think happened between 14
and 19 to help you secure that?
>> I think that we all presume that it's
all us.
It's not sometimes also destiny.
>> And what are the chances of somebody
coming from out of nowhere
>> from the streets of Delhi and landing up
and then working for 5 years and then
defeating the national president of the
Indian National Congress. That's never
happened in the history of our country.
I think they didn't see me coming.
>> They took you lightly,
>> which is good.
>> Yeah.
>> Now they saw me coming.
>> Yeah. How did you spend that day when
they were counting votes and
>> on in 19
>> listening to music
>> by yourself?
>> Yeah. In my room
>> and see and she asking people like what
is the count?
>> Everybody was on the table from what
5:30 everybody ran 6:00 every on the
table and they said to come. I'm like
>> no
>> no because I knew what I'd done. So I
just put on some music. I think I heard
the music till what 2 3:00 in the
afternoon around 4:00 I think Rahul
Gandhi gave a statement and then I had
very angry editor shouting on my phone
Arab Guswami what is wrong with you come
out and you know and Arab is somebody
who was a part of my TV journey because
we used to fight the establishment that
did TRPs we were very um I think
agitated about we said it's being fakes
and blah blah blah. So as young TV
personas, we were, you know, fighting
the good fight for the larger industry.
So I think he he's the only one who
would have the audacity to call and
literally shout, "Come out." I'm like,
"No, but I think that I mean I'm very
eclectic in my taste." But uh I think he
shouted then other people started
banging on the door and said, "Come out,
come out, speak." I'm like, "Why? Let it
get counted." And they were like, "Why
are you so stoic?" I think that that
side of me really irritates a lot of
people.
>> They're like, you know, you're so
centered. Why aren't you excited? I'm
like, no,
>> I think it's important for me to just
reach a particular goal that I set for
myself and then just walk on it.
>> Yeah.
>> You should not get so trapped with the
jubilation
>> that you don't see the next step.
>> I very early in my life readard
Kipling's if
>> yes,
>> I think I'd ingrained it. So I was like
ah take care. So I came out I went out
and there's a photograph of me peeping
and I'm asking the DM. I said
counting madam.
So the opposition kept taking objection
out of objection and people like we have
to fight this. I said no no say gint. I
said nobody interfere.
Let everything get
>> no no no let everything get recounted
two three times. I don't care. count.
Then at 12:00 in the night, they said,
"Count is over and you're one." I said,
"Thank you. I'm going." I told the team
that was also working Karaka. I said,
"Go and take the certificate." They were
like, "You know what a big thing it is."
I like, "Yeah, take the certificate. I'm
catching a flight, going home, seeing my
kids, and going to sleep."
>> Sweet.
>> So, I went home.
>> And you slept?
>> I didn't even see the headlines the next
morning.
>> Wow.
>> I believe I was on the front page, but I
didn't see I didn't see anything. And
then after I'm saying that you know
again because I you've had so many
interviews I don't take up too much of
your time so many important portfolios
becoming like the youngest union cabinet
minister working so closely with the
prime minister so many things that
people will not be able to do in their
lives. I mean it's a unique it's a
unique and very special life. I know
things in in your time that I thought
were remarkable that things that you may
not have uh initiated but that you
fought for that you fought for
amendments for but touching on just a
couple of them uh for example you know
because you talked about malnutrition
earlier as well the portion tracker app
>> that was me
>> that was you exactly that was you so how
when that came in the difference that it
made to children in
>> oh when I became the minister I was told
that there are 8 million children who
are severely acutely malnourished and
given my training by the prime minister
I said show me the numbers and show me
the evidenced position on the numbers
>> somebody from UNICEF said oh but this is
a supposition I said you are shaming my
country on a supposition
>> say can we start collecting data how
will you collect data I said well the
prime minister said every young body has
to be digitally connected and everybody
has a mobile phone so this heard what
will we do? I said okay I'll create an
app.
>> Yeah.
>> Um Bill Gates was kind enough. He said
fine. Um the Gates Foundation said you
want to create an app. I said I want to
create it and then dedicate it to the
country give it to the government and
they coughed up um some support built it
in one month
>> sat with Yeah. So I said you pick your
engineering team uh you pick your uh
platform people and we'll sit together
and let's see what we can get done. We
did we built it in 1 month. Uh it had it
deployed in 2 months. Today it has 100
million beneficiaries, 2.2 million
workers, 1.4 million Hendaris
and in April this year the prime
minister gave it the best innovation in
governance award.
>> That's amazing.
>> Yeah. Three months. You know people talk
about the digital divide in India.
>> It was a great it still is a great
governance tool because I would call a
particular state and say listen
for
so we could track how many hours
somebody spends servicing the needs of
women and children in that particular
ang. we could track the uh height and
weight of every child and if one child
did not conform to the WHO standard we
would alert the medical community the
CMO would go look into that child they'd
be rushed to the n uh nutrition resource
center so we set up a very seamless uh
system
>> even when it came to the LPG schemes I
wanted to ask if there was perhaps any
instances because you work so closely on
the grassroot level
>> I actually saw most of it flourish even
in my own constituency see before I came
to Amiti
around 60 to 70% people didn't have
electricity
>> right
>> before I came to Amatei uh I didn't have
a CT scan machine or an X-ray machine in
any of the hospital the district
hospital didn't have that I helped build
the collector's office there
>> the chief medical officer's office there
so I had to begin from scratch by the
time it was done my service in a matei
we had one lakh homes built three and a
half lakh farmers connected to the
treasury uh we had 1 and a half lakh
women who got the LPG connection close
to what 80,000 families that got
electricity connection for the first
time. I built the first 200 bedded women
and women and child hospital there
brought in the first CT scan. Uh Boeing
was kind enough to donate it. Uh what
else? Oh, I built the helped build the
first medical college there, the first
jail there, uh police line. Um then what
four five labs for farmers and yes I
managed to get an airport under udan
scheme along with cleaning up of nali.
So everybody everybody would you know
kind of if I passed through a village I
said di wait I have this problem with
anali can you call somebody get it
fixed. So you while you're building all
that infrastructure I mean he was never
connected to the national highway. So my
good colleague Nathan Gkari I'm like sir
I need you know highway passage okay
fine I need a ring road okay fine I
think it's the the just the joy of
building something for somebody else not
for you
>> but imagine one lakh homes means at
least four people live in one home
>> to give four lakh people a roof over
their head
>> that is joy
>> and that idea again I'm saying even when
it comes to banks and you know doing the
judgment
>> so we had the largest Coca-Cola factory
in South Asia open up in a matey
>> and the Russians helped open up in
collaboration with the government of
India an AK203 rifle factory
>> so that's what gets um it's the supply
for the Indian army the rifles of the
Indian army come from mami now
>> and you know because we're talking again
about money and how important it is have
to have financial independence the
jandan scheme also 55% of them women you
500 million no 500 million Indians
opened an account
>> of which 240 million were women
>> uh then I saw Mudra open up Mudra had
300 million loans given out 70% of the
beneficiaries were women
>> and you were encouraging women and
telling them the need to have
>> right now which is all the um u how do I
say this hawkers street hawkers out of
which six lakh women have gotten loans.
>> Yeah.
>> So we used to collect small small small
you know these uh cohorts of women
self-help groups were 9 cr women
received like 8 lakh cr rupees from the
government straight into their account.
So in your constituency you would give
out that money in your constituency you
will get that hawker to sit together.
you see lives being built around you.
>> I think there's no greater satisfaction
that there is nothing no adulation that
you can get as an actor
>> which is comparable to the satisfaction
you get out of building homes and lives.
>> I wanted to touch on one of the other
ones which was the um prevention of
child abuse.
>> Yeah. Um I think again you know even
when I was a student we would learn
about international relations and there
was a subject on gender and
international relations and this um
concept or this conception that perhaps
women in positions of power would be
against the death penalty and that we
might be
>> it was a stated position of my party.
>> So I was there in opposition when the
prevention of sexual harassment at
workplace bill was passed and I spoke on
behalf of the opposition and the then
government. I was there in the
opposition when the Nirva case happened
and again midnight we were um
legislating on it. I was in Raja Subha
again I had the privilege of speaking
for all political parties
>> that night.
>> I think that it is a process which I saw
unfold before me um in 2014 when Prime
Minister Modi took office and not a
penny had been spent. So when I became
gender minister uh the officiating
capacity that my ministry had we said
what all does you know the prime
minister envisage out of the nurba fund
we had 700 plus one-stop crisis centers
set up across all districts of our
country we had 1,68 fasttrack codes set
up across the country of which around
440 codes were only for children
>> and what close to two and a half lakh
cases got solved in
Forensic science labs opened up, rape
evidence kits distributed at every
police tana. We had a women's help desk
which came through. What all have we
done? 35 helplines for women.
>> Um what over 20 cr calls answered,
tracked even if they would repeatedly
somebody would call it would get
tracked. We set up the first ever sambad
program to help caregivers of children
who were in conflict with law and they
were living in those children's homes
>> 7,000 such uh we actually ensured that
all of them we set this um I set this
legislation in place where we made
pornography uh digitally um punishable
under law. There is a lot one could do
and that's why I'm saying that the
adulation you get as an actor is
nothing. The fact that you're of value
to your country to your people
>> that some kid will get the protection of
that law. For instance, I was on set
today and somebody inuling was running
around. I'm like yeah no no no we have
to take uh a child actor so we have to
go through this process and they have to
get a psyche well done. And I was
smiling. They said, "Didn't you write
the I said, "Yeah, I did.
>> I wrote the book on this."
>> Yeah, I wrote the book on this.
to tell men at work that if you want to
intervene and tell something to a female
about let's say I mean um somebody's
wearing a dress
>> and a male colleague on set wants to
correct something you have to actually
stop them to say listen don't make any
verbal such indications where you in any
way bismerch the lady or cause her any
grievance suddenly Everybody around you
is mindful that oh a we can't do this.
>> Uh so your experience as a politician
comes handy even in this place of work.
>> Mhm.
>> Where as a technician you can tell
people fine if you're in trouble these
are your rights and this is the benefit
or this is the support one can garner
for you. Be it from an insurance
perspective some technician falls sick
or if a technician is hurt at work.
>> So that is a body of work that gets now
reflected within the industry. How can I
protect the rights of those who don't
have a fancy paycheck?
>> Right?
>> But now with me around um people in
production who otherwise would be a bit
stern like
she may just unionize them. So
>> no I think it'll be incredibly valuable
to have you on any set including this
one. Um we have had women at the top
positions of power in this country but
still representation is there's a gap.
>> How do you how do you evaluate that gap?
The global gender gap index report
speaks about this whole value that they
bring to what is political empowerment
of women. I have contested it at the
world economic forum and I have a letter
from them. I had it as a minister
because they would show India in bad
light
>> and I said give me the matrix of
computation which is they say oh no we
look at women in parliament
>> hogwash. They look at the women who are
cabinet ministers. They don't count the
women who are in the council of
ministers under the prime minister's
leadership. They don't count women who
are ministers in state governments.
They don't count women who are elected
to state legislative assemblies.
>> I thought these were the ones it's 10%
in state assemblies.
>> No,
>> we have 1.4 million women as we speak
today who are elected to punch.
>> Mhm.
>> Because the minute you start counting
the 1.4 4 million women. Forget the only
women in parliament, only women in
legislative assembly. Just the volume of
1.4 million women from India puts India
at the top.
>> So just because others don't have this
decentralized constitutional hierarchy
to serve in our 1.4 million women get
counted out.
>> Right
>> now it is extremely difficult to fight
an election in a panchiat because the
voter base is smaller.
You are indigenous to your you know your
constituency. It is much tougher there
because you're coming from the rural
ramp parts. Imagine that tough election
winning here and still not getting
counted.
>> Today you have close to 1
9 cr women who are in administrative
services in our country.
>> Mhm.
>> 60 lakh are only those who are Asha and
Angari workers.
They don't get counted as harboringers
of power
>> as administrative and obviously as
ordained by law effective partners in
the growth of our country. So the issue
that we need to ask and I've asked this
of the world economic forum is uh if you
don't count us
if we are not spoken of does that mean
we are not resilient enough or powerful
enough? If you look at the finance
commission, the treasury had tied money
that goes from the treasury to the
punchayat on the basis of gender spend.
That is something nobody talks about.
>> Mhm.
>> Not many countries. I feel that maybe
India is the only country which has tied
the funds from the treasury to the
panchayat on gender.
>> Mhm.
>> But never gets spoken up.
>> So what did the letter say? What they
sent you?
>> They said they'll fix it. They haven't
yet
>> because to fix it you have to find other
parallels to our democracy. There are
none.
>> But it's still important to have that
33% legislation.
>> No, but it got passed.
>> I've seen the struggle of two decades,
two and a half decades by women across
political lines who wanted to make sure
that the 33% legislation passes.
>> I was witnessed when Rajnat Singh gi
made it 33% reservation for women within
the BJP possible. I think what for me as
somebody from the BJP is of great
importance and a matter of great joy is
that two men at the helm made sure that
the reservation happens for women.
>> We've had political organizations where
women have led them
>> but they haven't done this for other
women.
>> But I want you to spell out for some
people why it's important to have that
>> because it gives you an even playing
field to compete. That is what you need
right now. a legislative compulsion
to give that opportunity just to
compete. We don't have that right now.
>> And you think that increased
representation of women will change the
national discourse in some way.
>> It is being evidenced through research.
Wherever women have constitutional or
administrative authority and control
over spend, their spend on education,
health is far greater.
Their spend on public infrastructure is
far greater. Their savings are far
greater. Let's say just Mudra,
>> right?
>> Okay. Before Mudra came, everybody spoke
about the lack of money. Especially for
those who are from very very financially
challenged backgrounds
>> that even if they wanted to be
entrepreneurial, they wouldn't have
access to credit
>> because for credit you need collateral.
Right.
>> So Mudra took away that burden of
collateral and the minute women landed
up, it was not a gendered financial
intervention. Mudra had know that you
have to give the loan to women. No,
>> it's women from the smaller towns,
villages who created a business plan.
Now the numbers look great but just
imagine that singular woman from a
village or a town or a slum made a
business plan went to the bank explain
to the bank manager or any official what
her business is all about gets that loan
services it and pays it back. Okay, if
you look at the NPA today for womenowned
businesses the NPA is less than 2%. The
NPA for male loan businesses in that
segment is 2 and a half%.
>> Right?
>> So women have not only proved that they
are financially prudent, they've proved
that they are financially responsible,
but women in our country have made a
financially evidenced case for women
around the world.
>> Right?
So I believe that these are things which
are not spoken of because for too long
we were the country where people would
just pat us on the head and say take
care you know even
>> you came from a fragile economy now
suddenly you're the fourth largest
>> what do you think the top three are
going to do to you hug you? No,
>> they're going to elbow you out,
>> right?
>> So, they are going to kind of undo try
and undo a lot that you've done to
create a national confidence in what you
are as a country and they will hit a lot
of such verticals to say how do I
minimize the impact.
>> Let's again reflect on another truth
which cannot be denied. Remember co we
did not have a vaccine.
>> There were countries that were running
out of toilet paper.
Yeah,
>> we made sure that our vaccine program
was on an app called Goen.
>> But we not only administered that
vaccine to 1.4 billion people and two
doses. That's not a easy feat in 644,000
villages in a country which is as
diverse as us, geographically as you
know diverse as us. We managed to do
that and then we sent that vaccine to
160 countries. Yeah.
It's not an easy task.
>> From all the various projects,
initiatives, is there one that was
closest to your heart?
>> Every one of them.
>> And is there one story?
>> Oh, every one of them. I see so many
families walk up to me. I used to be
minister education. I had the privilege
of writing the base document for the
national education policy.
>> So I have kids and I used to write
letters to kids who did well in you know
the 10th and the 12th board exams.
teachers who were very supportive
children who are divy young
>> uh who had who are differently aabled I
meet many such people I meet I mean
randomly I was standing someday just
trying to get into my car somebody ran
from
and said I'm from
I walked into your studio today
>> yes
>> I don't know anybody from Adams Yeah, I
know.
>> How was the Guju started speaking to me
in Gujarati?
>> Yeah.
>> And
>> they always speak Gujarati to anybody.
>> Yeah. But I'm not a born Gujarati.
>> My dad is a Maharashtra. My dada is a
Punjabi. Post partition came to Uttar
Pradesh. My nani is from Asam. My nana
is Bengali and I have a pari husband.
But the minute they all saw me, there
was Bonhamed. They all knew me.
>> Yeah.
>> And I think that's the greatest joy
about being me.
>> And how do you Nobody can pick up any.
You and I first met.
>> Yeah.
>> On an airplane.
>> Yes, I know. I remember when I messaged
you, I said, I remember.
>> Nobody knows this.
>> No.
>> But one of the first people that I
interviewed
>> 30 years ago was your brother.
>> Yeah,
>> I know.
>> So, my life is pretty strange. There is
genuinely evidence of six degrees of
separation.
>> Really?
>> But I do meet a lot of people who have.
>> And even today, you keep that grassroot
connection in life. How? Like
>> I have no idea. Isn't life beautiful
just when you're approachable?
>> I I like to be approachable, but I
>> I mean, not everybody.
>> I mean, I didn't know you from Adams.
>> You saw me on a street in London and we
could just wave to each other. My you
know, my family looked at me, you know,
Sally Khan. I'm like, nope.
>> No, I don't. And why did she?
>> So, is there something about you
>> that makes people comfortable?
>> Yeah. And I think if you have that
trait, that's a valuable trait. You
should keep that.
>> How many hours at night do you sleep?
>> No idea.
>> But it seems my cameraman says when I
sleep for only 2 hours, I look better.
>> That's not true.
>> It is.
>> That won't last.
>> I have Oh, I don't know. But it has till
now.
>> And do you have some kind of like uh
self care?
>> No.
>> You're like what? What is that? What do
you mean? Selfcare.
>> No, I think as you
>> look amazing, I would say.
>> Oh, thank you. That's all makeup. But
>> as you
>> I think as you grow older,
>> you enjoy your silences more.
>> I love my silence. I love my alone time.
I love all of that. I don't know how
much me, but I just like the silences at
times. It's lovely to watch. I love to
see people thrive. I love to see people
happy.
>> I want to ask um again because your life
is there's so much to talk about. your
proximity to the prime minister to work
with somebody that people will not most
people will not have a chance to meet.
Um as a
>> and let me break the biggest myth.
>> Okay,
there is nobody close to the prime
minister
but the ability to have
>> everybody who any anybody that you ever
meet who says how great a close
relationship they share with the prime
minister, they either don't know the
prime minister or they're outright
lying.
He's somebody who left home and earth
for a larger purpose.
He has never picked up people who then
don't become effective enough to serve
that larger cause.
>> For him, it's very clear. I have one
life. I want to give back to my country.
That's it.
>> Mhm.
>> So, he doesn't entertain or he doesn't
indulge people just for the sake of
indulgence. Mhm. What I've learned, I've
worked with him since 2002, 23 years
now.
He teaches you how to work at the
details. You better know your job and
more so if you're working with him
because he has an elephantine
memory. He will remember what you said
on that topic in 2007, what you did in
2016, and he would just look at you
like, "No, I don't think so." So, you
don't want to be in that space ever.
in my 10 years of working with him as
minister and I'd worked if you look back
my two opportunities of serving in Rajya
Sabha were courtesy him he's very clear
I mean I still remember the first time I
filled my form for Rajya Sabha there was
just him me Mrani and we were sitting
and every other candidate had tasha and
this whole entourage and he just looked
at the two of us said
let's go gets up and he says, "I'm
nominating you." So there's this hush in
the corridor. He goes, "SI signed the
papers. You signed. Okay,
congratulations. Okay. All the best.
Go." I go, he leaves for his office. By
the time I get to Ahmedabad, this is and
Gandhiagar is his office. I get to
Ahmedabad. There's a knock on my door to
say, "Listen, lady, these are books here
to study. These are the issues you have
to take up on behalf." So he's very very
>> focused. Ah, he's very focused.
and one learning one
>> how to work
>> how to work and through example also
>> dispassionately he doesn't get very
infused with emotions he's very very
clear no favorites
doesn't forget foras at all so that's a
tough taskmaster and if you're with that
taskmaster for 10 years
>> you become good at your job
>> yes you become sharp as hell
Tell me about the this era of politics.
There's a lot of for example direct
access now. People are on Twitter.
People write directly to their
constituency. I mean it's good. Um uh I
mean for too long people in this country
were told right
what to do, how to do.
Now I think social media has
democratized access to power which is
good.
>> No politician should ever forget that
this is a service. It's not a privilege
for you to enjoy.
>> Mhm.
>> It's not a safety net. It's not comfort.
If you don't want to serve people,
please don't take that seat and don't
waste the people's time. This is a
country we are serving.
>> I want to ask you
about this.
>> Yeah.
>> I haven't finished it, but I'm reading
it because then
>> isn't it well written?
>> It is.
>> Sorry, I sound pompous, but it is well
written.
>> No, it is so well written down to the
acknowledgements at the end also, which
I really enjoyed reading. I
many questions again but the
>> it's a thriller people expected you to
write something either political or
poetic but this is this is edgy this
pace like who's done it and you you're
reading it it's it's a page turner
>> but uh do you feel like sometimes
>> you know you said it was also driven by
you went to a press conference you got
very angry um by some of the uh
incentive
>> debate
>> that people make pushed you to write
this story and then you felt that
fiction was necessary.
>> Yep.
>> Um, so can you tell us a little bit
about that?
>> I think that I have this great affinity
to those who wear the uniform.
>> Yeah.
>> And I feel that in a country where
people pursue power and politics, where
people pursue money, where people pursue
fame, those in uniform
only pursue service. They know that
their valor may be celebrated or go
unnoticed. they sacrifice their lives.
We may think of them on the 15th of
August or on the 26th of January or
maybe when somebody's bestowed a medal
otherwise can you imagine knowing that
you may be forgotten but still going to
serve.
>> So I wanted to tell the story of such
people who serve absolutely unnoticed
>> in some of the toughest terrains in our
country who die become a small headline.
This was my way of saying thank you.
>> And in the acknowledgements you said
that you felt the need to write it write
a fictional story.
>> I can't in a constitutional position uh
given my responsibilities write fact.
>> You know too much.
>> So you but it then liberates you and
you're able to say things. Um
>> no the story was waiting to be told for
10 years. I just had to say it. That's
it. So it brings me back to I think it
was my first or second question is so it
brings me back to the beginning where so
much has been done and you said you feel
like you haven't done anything. So what
do you feel you would like to do next?
>> I have no idea.
>> I just know that whatever it'll be will
be to the best of my ability. That is
the only thing I can assure you of. I
think ambitions transitioned from
wanting a roof over my head and two
meals a day with the security of a
paycheck the next month to now having
that security and wondering should I be
asking for more. So what I seek is an
opportunity to serve. Today I serve at
the crossroads of both politics and
media.
the only person doing it.
>> Forget the only woman, only person doing
it. I'm mindful of the fact that I'm the
first one from the industry who has
served as education minister and written
the education policy. That's never
happened in the history of our country.
When co struck, I'm the textile minister
who India never had a PPE kit industry.
I had create the industry when the
country's back was to the wall and there
was this huge global challenge and in 3
months we became the second largest
exporters to the world. Now um that has
been my contribution.
Um what I've done in television is
obviously marked in history
but like I said if you ask me 2003 did I
know I'd do all these things? I didn't.
I think the one thing co taught us was
like no matter what you plan, you need
to respond to God's plan.
>> That's true. And you need to be able to
just adapt.
>> Just be grateful when you wake up the
next day and say, "Okay, can I make this
better for somebody?" That's it. That's
the ambition.
>> Can I be better than me? And can I make
this day a bit better for somebody else?
>> And just lastly, because now you find
yourself acting again, you do have a
voice as an actor also. So do you feel
>> which may not align with other actors
voices at times
>> but I feel like you'll be heard
>> yes but I think that what are the voices
that are not heard the sound technician
is not heard the camera person is not
heard hair and makeup is not heard
junior artists are not heard mainstream
actors do get a voice
>> but will you amplify their voices
>> y
>> like you did today
>> but they are very much I mean we get
seen right
>> yes
>> but they are doing the hard work And
lastly, if you Tulsi today could say
something to Tulsi 25 years ago,
>> get a better paycheck.
>> Yeah, get a better paycheck is a good
one. And I think you have
>> I did.
>> Thank you so much for giving us so much
of your valuable time.
>> Thank you.
>> And really sharing some amazing
insights. I'm so honored to be in this
conversation with you. And I really do
feel that we have very few role models
when it comes to women
>> in position. Don't say role models.
>> Men and women have feet of clay.
>> So it's your responsibility and mine to
say if you're looking for role models,
look around in your own families. Look
at your mother. Look at your father who
may do much for you and never get seen.
>> See them. Be grateful there in your
life. Some people have complicated
family lives. Doesn't matter. Be
grateful. Glad that you're alive. That's
it. Stop looking at other people as
idols. You may find some right there in
your family.
>> Thank you so much, Priti. I was really
excited to have this conversation with
you and I feel that everyone at home um
would have really benefited from
learning about real experiences working
on the ground. Um some valuable
takeaways I think of anybody who has
aspirations to join public service and
to perhaps give back to their country.
Leadership is actually built over years
of hard work. It takes continuous
learning and it's very important to as
you said stay connected to your purpose
and to have that sort of clarity. I hope
um today's episode leaves you at home as
inspired as I am. I do want to thank you

About Her. Please don't forget to like,
