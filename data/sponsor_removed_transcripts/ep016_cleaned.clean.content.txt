When I'm 49 I Realize the Potential of

But Networks Also Get With You Too Three
Burdens and Disadvantages.
Ok?
So you should be analytical in everything.
And analysis cannot happen when you
Become emotionally involved in something

It has no commercial value for me

Never felt. It didn't work even when it was sprayed.
Not total. That's what I'm saying. power is a
State of mind. If You Presume Somebody

The Context That You Set Up in a Different
Fashion. Why you in the room?
Hmm.
That person with money, that person with power.
Why Do They Want You in the Same Room?

hmm
Foundationally You and I May Have Suddenly You Known
The foundational pieces of our life which
B. Similar, both are from North India
Are from normal families. How are we toot
How to deal with life we are never too
If we have someone to convert
If there is a style, what is it? two people
We talked quickly, we spoke quickly, we picked up
Up the Threads Later We Call the People
Friends. we
ok? When we have these discussions
Do it with an open mind. Don't hide anything.
Do it transparently. now you just
Position yourself at work place
And suddenly you are in a work place.
where you feel oh my
Has transparency become my burden or my
Is being used against. Why? because you
This has never been taught.
Satyam told you
Dharmam char means speak the truth on the path of religion.
Come on. And because you weren't taught it
Is. you meet them again too
To whom this craft has been taught. we
Who have been told. wear clothes like these
Meet people. Get out of the car like this.
If you meet someone superior then this is how
Must behave. because they are watching
That example from their own parents,
Their Own Family Ecosystem.
What have we seen our parents doing?
hard work
I haven't learned the trick, I don't know it.
that's not a trick
Didn't even learn strategy
That's their way of life
That's why when you confront such a person
Yes, they say that sir means charbaaz.
What are you saying because they
life is our own
yes he has life
Like there's a big controversy going on here
The Dynasty Napobi
That's a way of life.
Or what do you think should be learned? from all this
It makes a difference to get off like this, wear these ways
Live from.
Would you be in this room today if you were that
Everyone learns?
No.
Then
I don't even hit my hands and legs.
so then
And hitting hands and legs. see what the mistake was
is when people like us reach the top and
Stop hitting your hands and legs. because
The class that never accepts you
Nah. Even then it will not accept. whether you
How much you earn, how famous you become. it happens
like this in your life
yes yes 100%
And you think so, friend?
I sat in front of Bill Gates so much
gone but even today I am for this
I am like this only.
yes
And those people psychologically
Let's leverage the feeling. And if you
Caught in the illusion that you are their validation
Keep waiting for. them on them
Develop new strategies by creating a focal point
Yes, you do new things. You are defeated.
It is not theirs.
True.
Just now a journalist asked me why
Have you been there, Sadhvi?
My wish.
Like excuse me. hey hey used to say earlier
Why are you not doing the job? you are saying
Why are you working? Earlier we used to say hey
Why was the actor made a minister? you are saying
Yes, why is Shruti Irani not a minister?
made? I said toss the coin and tell me
Give.
What do you want to ask? yes i said it
Even my heads and tails will not work for me and many
People, you are very arrogant even with this matter, yes sir.
What should I say to such people then?
Do you think that age is not a woman if you
Are a Powerful Woman Criticism More
it happens doesn't it
It happens if you are free then it happens
problem
It's a problem with women in power.
Hey, what does Imvar mean? She's a little like that.
If you apply the tag you will suddenly get power.
i remember de
Something called the IPO is international
Parliamentary Union in Luganda

from before
Early.
Yes. Whatever happens, even from the neighborhood
Why not? meaning where father lived
There in New Colony in Gurgaon
Someone sent a message asking for dry cleaning.
There was a shop. I didn't know the room we were in
He lives in a dry cleaner's store.
There was room. we

Death of a relative abroad
So he called me at 11:00 pm
messaged in the office
That we are looking for Shruti Rani. we
Lived in his neighborhood when he was 5 6
Was one year old. So I thought 11:00

Three Weeks Ago. good
Well, those around here are saying yes.
Will not do anything. I said yesterday morning MC
we will open we will call we will
So the next morning I asked whether the call came or not.
When he came, my staff said, ma'am, he did not come.
I called back I didn't call
no one picking up the phone track trace
Finally that uncle told my staff this
Ambassy woke up in the morning and helped himself but
Smriti followed
So if you're someone's last hope
You Can't Afford to Turn Up

How can you not
If God Gives You That Opportunity
How can you not
Raj, no one might have helped you.
But whoever did it, do you remember it today?
all the people
And if God forbid you have
Someone from your area will help you.
Won't you ask for it?
100%
Then what is the difference with me?
Because you are in a position where perhaps
You can't help that many people
As many people might be asking you.
This has not happened to me till date.
10 lakhs in the constitution I was in

How can this be possible?
Is possible.
Someone must have been left behind. someone's voice
It may not have reached you.

So he has got help.
So it will be very difficult to reach you.
No.
Those who reach always reach.
You are accessible to
Everywhere to Everybody. One was that of the house
Two actors were talking to me outside.
Didi, suddenly someone ran away from the cart in front.

I had never even met him. he here
Working in the city. but he knows
that
Sister, will you do it? yes
Didi did it.
Did it. How many means how many in BJP
Workers are like this for 25 years, so many people
Worked together.
It is known that X and G have access to Shruti.
Go or I'll reach out.
Friend, you will help him.
Ok.
This is a matter of your strength. tell me
A weakness.
I listen to music very loud in my ears
It is Mr. Dal K.
Shouldn't listen.
come on
Seriously, that should be discipline.
The Discipline of Not Working Out.
I am very lazy. even after doing all this
With the Workout You Want
Do.
You Do, You Don't Like. I That's the One Thing
I Didn't Look After My Health You Never
Have This Not a Good Excuse
But you don't have time
I Didn't Have Time Now I Realize I
Should Make Time But Way Difficult
I tell myself not to eat sugar again.
I think there is mawa jalebi in Jabalpur.
Very bad weakness very very bad weakness
What's what's one insecurity what's
I have heard your biggest insecurity.

Think about it. Insecurity. okay let's do this
Let's dissect. insecurity kis-kis
What is it made of?

Are not completely informed.
we
Okay I'll ask this in another way. butt
What's Your Biggest Night Mayor Tell Me

People Won't Even Think About It
I new him.
I Saw the Photographs of the Kids Who Were

Because what do you do to Bhabhi when you see
Every.
I mean I've seen people have seen him s
Chief Minister Politician ble ble ble

And it's an oxymoron because nobody is
Going to inform and then go.
So the contingency of it gives us everything
Everyone teaches.
What are you afraid of?
Don't feel afraid. I don't know, maybe I'm afraid
That I'll Walk In And What If Mother Doesn't
Wake up.
I'm Calling What If Dad Doesn't Pick Up.

God.
That's Almost Everybody Fears.
That's it.
I know it's going to happen.

In the middle of the bed so it's a very human hum
You call up my father one day on a Sunday you

Okay I'm asked to ask you a very simple
question ok
ay hi
What is it like to be the inner circle of
there is
Top leadership in the country
There is no inner circle
PM Modi and you were inner circle like they are
like 10 20 people
PM Modi is the circle that's it
What it's like to be in that circle
PM Modi is the circle
There's Nobody Else
but you're in
The Other Myth That People Propagate About Have
hey i recommend them hey i
Hoover Has Told You This Is Just Blatantly
Lung
there is nothing
There Is He Who Will Disseminate Work Thats
It You Work You Report That It There Is
no underash
There is no inner circle
i think i am
I'm the way I'm a lot also because of
How I Watched Him
What have you watched it? very precise
Very professional very direct no nonsense
Doesn't Create Small Talk Nothing
Work Hard to Get Out You Would Assume
That's what you know will have an honor which
feeds him stuff
You Would Be Amazed By How Much He Is Himself
Driven How Much He Has Experienced
And bring forth on his own what he does is
He Will Take the Best of Every Field and He
Will Se X Y G With Me So It's Mine
Have experience.
He'll Tell Me This Is The Issue This Is The
Outcome I Don't Let Me Be
And That's the Best Way to Learn That's One
Of the Best Bosses to Have Nobody Looking
Over Your Shoulder Like This Didn't Wall That
true
I work with him 22 years
I Worked With Him When He Was Chief
Minister S Well
bean pattern
This work has been given to Smriti and this result will come.
leaver alone
How will that memory come?
She will do that with Smriti and there is
Nothing More Empowering for the Lack of a Better
Word then that when the Prime Minister of
The Country Knows and Your Leadership Knows Smriti
It is given, it will happen
You worked with Atal Bihari S well and you
Work vs PM Modi What are the differences
We call him Baapji at home. That's what happened
Philosophical poet politician.
My interface with him was way different from
Prime Minister Modi because I was a
Worker Who Found a Blessed Place
Among his family.
hmm
So Hindon I Never Interacted As You Know
Prime Minister and
An individual who is supposed to deliver on a
Particular project of acid. So, I have
Seen a different side of him.
But what are the differences between both of them?
In personality?
Prime Minister Modi is 247 driven.
You've met anyone else. Who's like that?
No. That Man Is All Work Every Minute Of The
Day.
I've Never Seen I'm Like With You
Chill from the guys. No.
Nothing.
He is so clear. It's a Huge Country 1.4
Billion People We Don't Have Time to Waste
Very clear on that
Baapji Was Somebody I Had Seen 25 Years Old
He Would Give You That Space to Culturally
Evolved So I've Seen a Different Facet
off snow
we
you joined in 2003
or
and then
You Got Your Major Responsibility in 2014
i mean cabinet cabinet major can speak
Organizationally I was in you're from
Indore. So Tai ji is from Indore, right?
I know.
So me and tae again go back 20 years. So
I have worked in Indore. I work in yours
City. So Ahalya Bhai Holkar ji's
The palanquin moves, I am one of two people who
Done the sedan also.
You were everywhere. I know you've done so
Much work, star campaigner.
Apart from that, I've been this way
President of the Youth Wing here in
Maharashtra.
Twice I have been the National Secretary. I
Work with five presidents JP Nadda
Who is the current President Amit Bhai before him?
I work with Rajnath Singh I have worked with
Nitin Gadkari and Venkaya Naidu S
Presidents
How Do the Taste Before Giving You Any
Major Responsibility Is There a Process
I Think 2003 Is When My First Taste
Was given by a politician in Maharashtra
Whose No Longer Amongst Gopinath Munde So
Munde ji
Vaz
Off-the-opinion brothers do all the social work.
Are.
If you want to bring change, then be a policy maker.
Be.
we
Because This Is a Conversation Here and I
Had and I was working in Talasari
Here in the outskirt of Maharashtra and he
Was like ok everyone does it. society for all
Have to change. But tectonic shift policy
Electoral politics for him if he comes from
Is part of. So what's yours what's the
One thing that you want to do? Now 2003 There
There are not many young girls in Yuva Morcha.
It was mostly a male Asian. so i
Said brother, why shouldn't girls come?
Youth wing means youth is as much age as girls are
Men and you know women have political
Ambitions. Even if they are 18 years old and
20 years old. So why should they be?
we
It's fine as is. From an organizational point of view we had
55 districts. so there is one
Administrative Districts as Ah
Articulated by Govt. One is BJP
From your organization's point of view. So that's it 55
Can you find one female leader in the districts?
Is in that age group we so i said or so he
Like ok ok find me he says we been
Trying to Find This Is Your Sixth Month
Target Fine Went From Village To Village To
Villages Across All Districts We Found
And 50 Devendra Fadnavis The Current Chief
The minister was vice president with me at
that time
Ah so three of us got together and
Across 55 Spots We Found 55 Young Ladies
Who could take the issue of women leadership in youth
Weighing Forward in 2003
And I Remember Month Five I Requested
Munde ji to meet all 55 and he likes it
Gone That Set Like the Template That Whatever
will do it twice
Hmm so then keep tasting you again
like that
They Don't Taste You Than Everybody Else
Assign a Project Teams Are Assigned Than You
Fulfill the standards benchmarks and
Outcomes that are Expected of Dose
Projects. 2003 was also when
Vasundhara Raje for the first time was
Presented as Rajasthan Chief Ministerial
Candidate from the BJP. So, Pramod
Mahajan at that time was alive. so, hee head
Been Departed to Make Her Fight Rajasthan End
There's a group of 100 boys who've gone
To Kind of Assist You Know We Do the Runners
ah The Once Who Would Set Up Offices The Once Who
Would be a part of the philosophical and
Statistical Team Who Will Do Local Publicity
Who will do coordination in the office?
Where will such a leader go?
Who Will Meet Communities and All That Just So
One of the group of 100 boys
I was the only exception
1001 99 plus one
or
So It's Like You're Dispatched Many A
Times As A Part Of Group
And Obviously If You're Politically Very
atune and sharp you will learn
And it dip you're watched on everyone
Assignment So You're Given the Next
Assignment on the Basis of How Well You Have
Done in the current one
If You're Lethargic If You're Not a Team
player
If You Because That's Life and Death Right It's
A Small Kind of Time Window Where You Have
To do the best
So at that time they are enough people here
There is a thing called review
we
So After Let's Say An Assignment to the Elders
Do Sit and Do Review Who Did What
BJP is not one of two run of the mill
ok you have come ok you become a leader no review
Your attitude is reflected in the review.
work with people
A people outside a citizen's people within
Organization even from a microscopic point of view
is seen
Do you get trend as well
Is There Like Alert Trend On The Job On The
job
trend trend on the job
But there is no external like this
There is nothing
Few Leaders Will Make Sure That We Want The
Next Leadership to Come Up and We Will
Train them specifically.
This is training
On the job.
This is training on the job. like when
Narendra Modi a had this whole program ah
goodwill
S Chief Minister of
This is the dedicated press interface Sriti
Will do.
So Every Leader So Let's Say When I Became
Gujarat MP from the first time in half
An Hour of Me Coming Back to My You Know
Guest House After I Filled My Nomination
That means the result has not even been declared.
Filled my nomination from then chief
Minister Modi's office this whole bunch of
Papers and Books Came That You Study
Have to do this session of Parliament will come
There are issues of Gujarat then UPA
The government was at the centre. and please
Represent the State Well. These Are The Ah
What can you do additionally? so, you wood
Study All Dose Points. you would speak in
Parliament, You Would Learn Everything and
Then You Would Say, Sir, What If I Go To
XYG Minister and XYG
specialist and push this agenda for the
The State and the People. Say yes to you.
So, you'd come back and you'd report that
Sir, I have done access. parliamentary
Obviously There Is Enough The Landscape Is True
That's what you did parliamentaryly
Records are also made in writing and
Evie too
so you can't lie this is the place
No where you have punched or
No there is a record of your engagement
So you're tested of everything you think
I sent you somewhere
press conference or campaign
Hmm.
so you
How is your disposition as soon as you get off the plane?
With local workers? our feedback
Is the system. we take feedback from each other
Are. Do reviews even today. it's good
what? See you assume a leader's name
Ego will come saying hey how did I do this
Did it work well or not? It's not like that.
If you joined BJP then you would have won even today.
I worked with workers
All the workers are still in touch.
That and They Have to Have the Freedom in There
Engagement with you and after say yaar didi
It wasn't supposed to be like this
Like the head of our media cell today
Anil Baloni is also from Uttarakhand
He is an MP
we
Even today if I have to talk something I'll call
Anil Anil do you have any point of view?
It's Not Always Your Point of View
party's point of view
true
And at times it's also individual
Experiences That You Want Are Leveraged. now
Anil is from Uttarakhand. Ok? his who
The co-convenor is Sanjay Mehu, he is from Bihar.
So if I am going to speak in Bihar or
Sanjay, what do you think about saying something on the same topic?
Hey sister, if it happens like this, it will happen like that. so you
It's a conversation every time. It's a team
Work. It is not something that the leader has come
Said and left.
It doesn't happen like.
For Some It May Happen. I have not evolved
As a Politician Because of Anything Else But
This method of working because when you
Present Yourself to Anybody and You Are
Presenting Yourself as a BJP Person
You're Not Affecting Only Your Chances Of
How You're Perceived You're Also Affecting
The Chances of How Your Party Takes Your Leadership
Will Be Perceived
true
So to be mindful of that
true
Like which program did you go to?
It was the government's no to the creators
My training is true that I will watch every
Creator. So that has nothing to do with me?
So Do You Also Watch Things Which Have
Nothing to do with you?
But you'd see my introduction which is
Nothing to do with you and anything
Or because I will then study how you pursue the
Prime Minister.
But that's not me, that's not party training.
Hmm interesting. Every Email That Will Come
To Me and Everything That's Written About Me
Facebook Twitter
Instagram I Will Know
Personally. So Even I Don't Have an Inner
circle
That's incredible. How do you keep up with
These things.
Because they have enough time in the day to keep up?
Typical peak performer person saying this.
All That's What You All Say
Because Everybody Will Only Appreciate You If
They personally resonate with you
Ahead People Hate to Go Through Hierarchies to
Reach You and You Have to Give People the
Respect
Off picking up the phone when they call and not
How Some Assistant Get It to You
People Sometimes Flex It as a Power Play
That's Stupidity As Far As I'm Concerned
It Is Much More Warm When the Person
You're Calling Even If Dev Becomes Minister
Can pick up the phone. Say yes.
Right? Because Whatever Goes Up Will Come Down.
true true
And the Only Thing People Remember Is How You
Make them feel.
Nothing else.
Nothing else.
When you did all this, like you how operated.
At that level, now the fun of acting will come back.
In doing. You're coming back.
Can Your Life Be Only About One Thing? no
But Now Will You Be Able to Accept That?
It will be fun.
What's the fun?
you tell you
That's what I am saying is your definition
What is it? You are younger than me, right? Yes. so
What is the definition of fun?
Got to learn new things.
Yes. So what will I learn? Tell.
with acting
I don't know. Now. ok now you said that
I have an intimidating personality
we
Well now imagine that when I am in the form of Tulsi
I will see Mir shouting at me
Identity of people will be at stake many times
in the eyes
It won't be yours, I was doing a scene.
There is a discussion about my weight in Tulsi's book.
we
Look how thick his hands are
we
What Means Your Teaching People Comfort Around
u
hmm
To Say This One But What Do You Convince To The
larger audience
Body Shaming It's So Natural For Us To Do
It's for people especially women
So Am I Conveying a Very Hard Truth In
a very very
Dramatically Acceptable Way
This Is What I've Found for All My Life
From a policy perspective they don't
This You Know We Know Better How to Judge Women
And Not by How Their Bodies Look
But can I relay this announcement to a larger
Audience I Can't Have to Take a Beating
For it myself to relay that information
May Be But What Is The Penultimate Goal Relay
that information
But Do You Think People Will Accept This Now
They've seen you like something comes
That's where the acting and the writing
Comes. So what you see now is just me
What You Will See Because That's What Ekta
Thoughts of the character
we difference
will accept
Had I not done so, I would have been sitting at your place.
No but it hasn't come yet
But now like the way I'd see your mine
Parents Would See You Is Very Different. or
And now if they see the same Tulsi again then let them
Will Be Like Little
head is the craft
You're Coming Back Because of the Craft You Are
Coming Back Because You Just Can't Be an Idol and
it's okay
Like Business Private Sector
good
