this there was no such thing as a
trailer now suddenly you have to change
to hairdresser or
a and then you would do your business
and she would
say and that's it definitely there is
this feeling that uh you know stars are
demanding too much and it's Way Beyond
what the film can actually afford to
have Beyond its budget a lot of young
women who say I'm not a
feminist what is your reaction when you
hear
that but how do you mentally keep track
of
you don't six characters that you're
playing at the same time you don't who
is asking for them who is asking for
anything see for men there were only two
hairstyles okay if you put your hair
band your urb if you put it
down absolutely
Ral but I'm telling you I went through
different stages But ultimately now
after 50 years I still say that I don't
want much I just want
more Shaban as me thank you so much for
making time to speak with me uh 50 years
in
cinema and five national awards multiple
film Fair awards and achievements that
honestly if I were to sit here and call
out you we'd run out of time uh it is an
absolute honor to sit down with you my
team was doing the research and we
actually sat and counted year by year
and if I'm not mistaken it's over 160
films that's right yeah over 50 years
which should average U more than a
release a year but there are I think two
years when there was there was no
released but at least one release every
year for 50 years it's really something
it is really something it is really
something um when you look have you ever
stopped to think about it or when you
sit now and you look back at it does it
seem that vast a body of work to
you not consciously but uh because this
year I'm being felicitated a lot and all
that so I'm sort of looking back at it
but really fa I I I think and this is
without false modesty that I have been
very fortunate to be at the right place
at the right time and I really uh mean
it because look at the wondrous things
that happened okay so I got the gold
medal for best acting in student and 4
days later I was actually shooting on a
film set when does that happened then
sham benal happened and then after it
was so successful
anur I mean Way Beyond anything that I
had imagined and Then followed by a
crazy film like fak
crazy film I say because it was so
mainstream and that became a success in
in spite of me not because of me I tell
you so it was just a sort of roller
coaster thing and every time it seemed
as though when Cinema was changing I was
there you were right there yeah every
time yeah so I mean that has to be
really good you know I would I would
think if um if if is a and we are all to
some level Cinema enthusiasts right and
if we all sat back and think of what is
the real the your favorite film or the
film that you think back on whether it's
a masum you were there if it's an amarar
Anthony for someone else you were there
as well so it's just such a wide range
of the kind of work you did um you know
everything from fire to Rocky
orik just the range is amazing and do
you remember now being conscious like
okay I'm going to pick this this film
because now actors talk about picking
films or did you just go with whatever
sounded exit exciting how did that
happen what you know you know when I
look back in retrospect I think that the
fact that I was doing both the art
Cinema and the mainstream Cinema
although I wasn't conscious of it at
that time but when I look back I think
it was because I felt that it was
important to become a star in the
commercials uh in the Comm special sense
because
uh what it would do I was hoping that it
would get audiences to come and see the
other films as well just because you
have a certain status now I didn't sit
down and it wasn't grand plan or
anything but that's how it happened and
um it was also strange because I was
from the film Institute and I was
exposed to um you know Swedish Cinema no
visian Cinema Japanese Cinema Italian
Cinema French none of which I would have
had to uh had the great chance to
witness had I not gone to the film
Institute because at that time you
didn't have that opportunity so I came
out of a certain idea of the kind of
film that I liked and I don't know what
it was that made me also go into a
mainstream Cinema I I don't know know
how it happened but uh I'm glad it did
it worked well but I mean it's called
paralin Cinema you are you happy with
that with that I really haven't been
able to find a term for it so I call it
parallel Cinema and I call it art Cinema
and all that and of course people have a
lot of problems with that and I read
somewhere that you did a lot of those
films for free yeah and you was
sustained by your commercial work but
you did a lot of the work for the art my
my my secretary used to be really he
couldn't understand me because he said
you know the the signing amount you get
for that film is more than the entire
amount you're getting for this film and
you're giving 40 days to this film but I
mean that yeah but it's also so crazy
that not only did we do films for free
not only did we bring our clothes we
brought the clo clothes of our co-stars
also everything came from home and uh
there was this crazy situation where I
was working in a film with BR isara and
suddenly we got to know that the
shooting schedule has been cancelled
because he doesn't have any money so
sanjie Kumar who is known as a kjus
sanjie Kumar uh chatran sin and me we
gave the money to and we had absolutely
no uh feeling that this is going to be a
great film or something but we like the
man very much and so we said
it was quite a matter of fact thing to
do
actually you've um one of my favorite
films that you worked on is city of God
which is beautiful and a lot of the
actors you worked with then are not with
us anymore like Patrick sing like om
Puri tell us what that was like what was
that set like what what did you what
were you doing between shots when you
all were hanging out together what was
that conversation like you see uh for
firstly uh what had happened is U Roland
jofi and I met and there was something
about him that I found very intense and
very nice and he spoke to me and then he
said all right you're doing the film it
was very comforting to have uh om Puri
with whom I'd done so many films and we
were for three months we were in uh
elata M the Grand Hotel and uh I know
I'm not exactly answering your question
but just to tell you that both of us are
Foodies oh put in and by that time we'
eaten everything the hotel had to offer
can you imagine that both of us bought
tiffen boxes okay home and myself
anybody on the street would say come to
my house for dinner yes please can I
also bring my Tiff box and bring one for
oh also I mean we were just wanting to
eat food but apart from that I had uh
Patrick was wonderful he was absolutely
wonderful and so was Pauline uh Collins
uh but the trouble is that Patrick was
so taken up by om Puri that you know he
had almost this
reverential and he would keep saying the
director would say no but that's not the
expression we want you
to just and all that and then it was
wonderful because we were trying to do
this scene which was quite crazy to do
on the streets
you bring 24 trailers obviously people
are going to notice it's the kind of
thing you to DOA you know you have to do
like how par we were just thrown on the
um Road uh Nasir and I and the camera
was gone you did all this
Jam they would then crowd everything
they would do absolutely
nothing so I was traveling with
rajinikant and we were surrounded with
go to and just surrounded with people
and I said my God I don't know what
we're going to do he said don't worry
and he went and in Tamil he spoke to
them and he said see we've got a guest
from um from Mumbai and from Bombay and
so we have to allow the car to park and
the water is just noted and this thing
went I was so amazed so I said
in please you
know and I and all
that said 1 2 three they would pull in
their
stomachs it was as far as they were
going that's it so three days we had
keep cancelling that shooting I mean it
was just
absolutely crazy what was happening over
there then there's one very favorite
incident of mine you know they brought
all this rain machines and everything
yes from uh Los Angeles
and turned out it was the last day that
Patrick szy was going to shoot and the
rain machine stopped so there was much
tension
there were these two little
boys sitting what is the problem so they
said you know you we'll do it give us
two horse pipes with those two hor pipes
they created that rain which is there in
the F even today so the whole thing was
you know we used to be in okay my God
we're getting a chance to work with
Hollywood as a they are learning from us
as much as we are learning from them so
because they are putting up systems
they've got um everything worked out so
we were sort of not used to that but the
thing is that because we are jugar
people if things go wrong in the system
we are always able to do something or
the other that they cannot do and then I
remember there was one particular uh
scene three times we tried it and all
kinds of things would happen and they we
were not allowed to do it and all that
so then I told the director I said uh
would you like me to speak to the Chief
Minister he said this never happens in
Hollywood but you will go out of your
way to meet the chief minister I said
yeah it's very simple so I went and met
uh bashua and then he told me several
things and all that and then we were
allowed to shoot it so all the time it
was something that we were learning from
each other but what troubled me
constantly is that I'm a woman from the
slum why am I speaking
English it takes some time to get used
to that mentally yes so he said uh
Roland said
Shabana the film is in English the
language of the film is in English so
you have to think that this is all
happening in
Translation which for me was such a big
relief because this is something that
I've always always always struggled with
but the fact is in
authenticity you cannot uh sacrifice
comprehension because suddenly if I
don't do that and if I suddenly start
speaking this language slum language to
hold then one thing that I was very very
taken up uh by them were these two
Mickeys who were absolutely
wonderful and they came to me and they
said uh you know you're shown cooking
rice and all that what kind of rice
would you cook so I said this I said but
do they show so no they don't show but
supposing the director wants a shot from
the top and you have to do that so you
said okay then he said what vegetable
will you eat so I said meaning so he
said you see the same vegetable that
you're
eating must do for tomorrow afternoon
also and you don't have a fridge H you
know this they had put that much thought
they had put this much kind of thought
and then
one thing which was absolutely amazing
the makeup guy had done a fabulous job
of a pregnant uh woman with the stomach
and the navl and everything like just
fabulous and he came very proudly and
now Roland was not even on the set and
he came to the ad first ad and said see
this is what I've done so the ad said
yeah it's very nice but you know somehow
it's looking very dead and I I know the
kind of filmmaker Roland is he'll want
in that pregnancy in that giving child
birth scene he'll want to go very close
can we do something about it and there a
makeup man
saying okay just hold
on and he went to an electrician he made
some Contraption he removed the stomach
he put that electrical device inside and
he had a switch in his hand so he would
do and it would look like as if the
cooking
kicking I mean it's just absolutely
aazing
fantastic that's
amazing at a time also I mean to be fair
in a lot of our mainstream commercial
cinema at that time like you know people
were donating blood into bottles that
were going there you know to sort of
keep it accurate was not really uh not
at all important you see what was
happening in mainstream Cinema it was a
alternative reality that they were
creating so no House of a policeman
looked like a policeman's house yeah
that was not even required it was not
required because I think there was this
subconscious desire that we we must not
locate it in a
particular place because if we say this
is Gujarat then maharash will not uh
ident identify with it or South Indians
will not do it FM alternative
reality so she's Miss Miss no no no Miss
no no no no
Miss and Mr Ash and Mr VI I tease ja to
this this
thing you have to exist in this
alternative reality it was left for the
OT Cinema to focus on the details and
create uh create a world that you could
actually identify that with so that's
how it happened now it's changing now
it's changing a lot more even in
mainstream Cinema they're really really
taking pains to see that they create uh
what is closer to reality than it was
except once in a way in a
for inst so you've had such a wide range
of
co-stars when you think back now who was
the
funniest lots of them are very funny
sanjie Kumar was also very funny and he
was very unkind he used to say horrible
things to me all the time I remember
once I was uh clipping my nails so he
came and he
said I'm a very dedicated and sincere
actress and in this role I shouldn't be
needing uh long nails so I'm cutting
it I put
on marking at him because he is so fat
and dedicated sinc
actress the
very and laughed away to glory and was
so
pleased with himself so pleased with
himself but I tell you a lovely story
about Rajesh K okay so Rajesh K and I
were working in lots of films and for
some reason he used to like me um very
much now one day he came U limping on
the sets and he'd hurt himself and so a
curious journalist came and said oh my
God how have you hurt yourself sir and
this that and the other so he said that
um you know was doing a horse riding
scene yesterday and I fell off the horse
so I said no but we were shooting uh
together when did you do the horse and
said give me one kick under the table so
I just looked at him so the journalist
went I don't understand he's saying
so so sweet they just lovely lovely
people
really that's
gorgeous you was also I remember in in
one interview you mentioned the fact
that you know you back then when you all
went on location or you traveled you
sort of all just shared your stuff and
said oh I have a red duata here it is we
way the way things are done now because
everybody even forget about when you're
Outdoors even when you here nobody
communicates outside the shot because
everybody goes to their uh trailers so
on one hand it's very comfortable to
have a trailer
because I hate
this there was no such thing as a
trailer okay so we would just sit under
whichever tree we could find now
suddenly you have to change and of
course there was no
question to
hairdresser and then you would do your
business and she would
say and that's it I mean it was so basic
and so crazy and so mad and uh but
somehow what used to happen is that we
were all together what after the shot
there was no place to go so all the fun
and games and all that would happen be
hanging out and sharing meals that time
yeah
yeah but I'm not just mourning because I
really think it's very comfortable to
have this uh trailer but I which you
were recently on Rocky and runny and
that's the that's a fullblown dhma
production right that's the that's
the things like
thata whatever you think of kar joher
it's all there very comfortable it's
very very comfortable let me tell you I
ain't
moaning you did say I I I heard the
recent interview we like you said you
know now obviously I'm making money and
it's a good thing I like the fact that
I'm making money so that's a big
Financial difference between being an
actor today and being an actor you know
when you started off yeah but you see
everybody's making money now because
what has happened is so much uh money is
coming in systematically so when you
have a budget the film is budgeted for
it 70s or
80s you were only budgeting for a
schedule okay
so so because money was coming in from
very strange people also people who just
wanted to give some money so that they
could say that we are making uh movies
get themselves photographed with a uh
Leading Lady and the leading actor and
interest that's
gone they would take three months to do
pre-production and the film would take 2
years yeah uh to make now they take two
years for reproduction and finish it in
3 months which is the way that it should
be and that's because the money is
coming in you know it's guaranteed it
will come through all the black money
has disappeared so it's all of that that
is making the ecosphere much more
healthy but I do want to ask you this
though the one stream that through your
entire career was to pick films that had
social messaging and films at that time
were also pushing Society forward by
having that social messaging if you were
to stand for where we standing now is it
is there a moral responsibility for
filmmakers for social messaging or is it
a business where you have to do box
office you have to pay your
people really but I Come From a Certain
background I come from parents who
believed art should be used as an
instrument of uh social change it was
just in my blood stream you know and not
to say that I was conscious right from
the word go I I was doing my own thing I
remember I
saw I
did and I was very
pleased
importantes and then I think I went for
a women's seminar Aruna they had taken
me and they said how could you do this
film so I said what do you mean I have a
lengthy enough role yeah which is
and they said have you paid attention to
what the film is saying so I said like
what so he said rajes K because they
split okay and then when she goes back
then rajes Kanna when they're separating
rajes the husband
says and they said you didn't Pro I said
my god I didn't even think think about
it of it and it's that then it started
uh turning on me because in the bu big
thing I was so busy we were working two
shifts a day we were doing so many films
you know there was a ban on the actors
saying that you can't do more than 12
films what had a time so when I was
doing uh uh with uh John
slesinger I was doing this uh film with
Shel mlan called Madam suzka I told him
this is what we do it has to be pure
greed there be no other reason for
talking such nonsense I said yeah but
that's the kind of work that people
doing so nothing was expected of us
except that you should see your dialogue
but but how do you mentally keep track
of you don't six characters that you're
playing at the same time you don't who
is asking for depth who is asking for
any
anything see for men there were only two
hairstyles okay if you put your hair
Bank you're Urban if you put it
down absolutely
rural so that's why people like Kumar
and amab ban and his early days and all
that are just so amazing because they
were doing all this work and yet I was
just thinking
then I
feel but it's just it's mechanical but
now I think the Advent of the casting
director has been a huge thing because
what the casting director is doing is
getting real faces getting people from
theater getting people from back of
Beyond and they being brought to the set
and you are people with real looking
people so there is some kind of uh
obligation that you put on yourself that
you can't look like you belong to a
different world and they belong so no
stock characters are there
otherwise the same in all the films
nothing you just put Murad there you put
people you you you put
entire ideas Notions of who there is
nothing else that is required so this is
my favorite example Rishi kapor was such
a fine
actor he's playing a rockar in CS
and guitar he's not playing any CS at
all he's just strumming strumming and
everybody's accepting that today Rishi
Kapoor want to do that yeah you see
because he knows that he'll be caught he
better play the cords so you are also
now demanding things of yourself and
because actors are only doing one film
at a time so they can afford to put on
weight lose weight grow their hair grow
their beard things all that that because
you have all the focus to do only one
film I mean working with ranvir Singh is
such a pleasure he is such a dedicated
young man I cannot tell you as
mainstream as you can imagine in Rocky
or Rani but he gives it his all he does
everything he if he wants to get the
accent the DI diction right he'll get
somebody who's constantly with him then
if there's a bre in the shooting then
he'll watch all the work that has
already been done so that there's a
continuity so all that is
happening everywhere everywhere and
that's a very happy uh time to be
working in cinema so you also come from
and I'm going to go back a little bit to
your childhood here I um to from a
family of artists and at that point um
your dad was a member of uh the
Communist party that's right art social
messaging politics activism was all
ruled into one I mean um your parents
lived their political philosophy yeah um
my understanding I understand they you
lived in a commune I also Liv in a was
and it sounds amazing but it sounds
other worldly from where we are today uh
what was that like to live in that
commune and do you think
um it's coined almost today in the
capitalist world we live
in yes of course of course because it
was uh you know it was a large flat in
Gan and uh there were eight rooms and
every family had a room each okay so we
had a room which must be anywhere
between 180 to 220 Square ft okay and
there was just a little strip of a
balcony that my mother had changed into
a kitchen eight families used to live
with one toilet and one bathroom I never
heard anybody complain or or saying
that nothing nothing of that kind and
only the hall used to be used for
Communist Party meetings and it was
called red flag Hall there was a big red
uh flag that was there p
mommy used to take me for her uh on her
tours when she used to go for theater
tours Abba used to take me and my
brother Baba for the mushas and he would
take me to all the places that he worked
with the laborers and stuff like that
and
so when I would go there they would all
take me on their shoulders and there'd
be this red flags and all I thought rent
is the color of party time but nothing
obviously there was no most social
Consciousness as a child but I was a
fiber if ever there was
a now stay in that commune I'm uh in
Queen Mary school okay and I'm telling
my friend that Enid bighton is my aunt
okay I'm George but I don't want to be
caught out so I'm telling
her but please call me George you don't
call me Shabana because otherwise all my
what's the length of your hair to pull
off that
F no but imagine so when I meet and then
excuse me I didn't even know that en
bighton is not in New York but I go New
York May by plane in this I'm living in
this little thing I go by plane to New
York on the weekend I do this little
adventure and then I come back and then
when I met this friend of mine Baka who
was the girl that I would tell this to I
said how can you be so D how can you
possibly she said with such Sparkle you
used to see and you used to create that
world for me that I used to envy you and
say except for the little um fantasies
that used to uh go on the rest of it was
discomfort with ABA because uh he didn't
go to office and he sat at home writing
something I didn't call him daddy I call
called him AB which was so strange uh
sounding
or uh P so I tried to hide him then when
he started writing in films and when his
uh photograph appeared and all my
friends said ah your dad's photograph
and all that then I opened him up then
everything that he said was
fine it
the ideals of India composite culture
secularism um gender equality all that
was a given it was a given I must have
been about 19 when I first realized that
what I took for granted uh as gender
equality is an exception rather than the
rule now look at my father's 70 years
ago he writes a poem called in which he
says and he
says So that obviously something that
is given for us you know it's a given
and then you have to negotiate the world
and realize oh my God things aren't the
way so you have your journey through
that some good some bad we have a lot of
um there there's a movement now on the
internet which I I find personally a
little lot of young women who say I'm
not a
feminist what is your reaction when you
hear
that you they still associating with the
bra Burning uh uh woman they don't know
anything I'll tell you very interesting
incidents
once I was in
uh in U America and I was ironing jav's
CA so this moment she said you call
yourself a feminist and you're ironing
your husband's CA she what has that got
to do with feminism and she said meaning
will he IR your S I said I'll never let
him it I'll do no such thing is
understanding he weak or or
um I'm not a feminist what does it mean
have you even thought about
it
Clarity what according to you is
feminism everything the Gaze you see the
whole gaze in the way you view the world
is different you know men and women are
different not better not worse different
different and that difference needs to
be celebrated equal but different equal
but different is the most important
thing because for far too long the world
has solutions to all problems from the
male yes point of view half the world we
are holding up half the sky so we have
to say we need to be included in that
dialogue and we must Force our way over
you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg the judge
who passed to me in the US she had said
that women deserve to be in every room
where decisions are being made of course
absolutely you have to have a place on
the table yes yes absolutely because far
too many things get decided about us
without us exactly and that's the
problem so in my mind uh feminism is
very simply equal rights equal
opportunity equal pay so it's not about
opening card doors closing card doors
paying the bill it's not of any of these
whoever reaches first I think should
open the
the door really what is it about male
and female and all these things both
confusion F
confusion and I think that you know even
this whole idea so this is now the idea
of the Trad wife which is women who are
pushing back saying no I want to stay
home and I want to cook and I want to
clean and I want to look after my
children not knowing that that is
feminism your ability to choose for
yourself
that's what it is absolutely if you
choose that life and that is giving you
you are making that choice your
mother-in-law is not making it for you
your husband is not making it for you
you are are Cho making it you're
choosing that's decision making agency
is everything
absolutely
absolutely is there equal pay though now
in the film industry in through this
journey
no and I know a lot of girls are very
unhappy about it but there's a
reason the
day a woman Centric
film starts earning the same kind of
money that male Centric films do it will
happen is just a matter of Commerce for
that it is very important that we ask of
audiences also that why should women
Centric films be only seen by women yeah
huh why shouldn't you encourage that and
in fact I have been telling the male
coars
important why why is it in your head
that of course it has to be male
oriented film but till that happens
there isn't going to be equal
because who bring the thing is changing
now certainly because there is no
guarantee that ABC actor will bring the
people in everybody is going damad all
you know Heroes film uh
not now have they got very good opening
so finally I think it is Dawning on the
film industry that it is content which
is King it cannot be the star the star
should be the director definitely
because a film is a director's
medium and for an actor to take total
credit I find very strange because see
it's such a collaborative medium there
is no way I can get give a good
performance if my character is not good
if my director doesn't have Clarity if
this script is not good it's the script
that is everything and then my cooster
because you see
when I'm looking into your eyes and
you're telling the truth because acting
is also reacting then I don't have to do
anything to just look at you so your
co-star is also extremely important so
actors get all the credit because they
are the people with the face in front of
the camera but if the actors know that
it's a whole host of technicians and
other people who are working to you know
hide your weaknesses and enhance your
your uh good
qualities content and director yes
should become up the St films and now
with um otd platforms and the kind of
stories that are being told of different
budgets different sizes different
characters for various age groups you
think that mainstream is also going to
have to sit back and say okay we need to
tell stories of more depth or it's not
not just about the formula of how do I
hit day one on the box office anymore I
don't see that happening although I
would very much want to see it because
what I find disappointing is that the OT
is now falling into the same triap the
Ott had an opportunity to create Stars
yes make their own stars because see
we've got three four uh people that we
can call stars or OT
platform instead now you want all stars
and you're willing to pay these enormous
uh amounts of money why so you are doing
a disservice to the Mandate you had for
making
this definitely there is this feeling
that uh you know stars are demanding too
much and it's Way Beyond what the film
can actually afford to have Beyond its
budget it throws the the entire business
propert opposition out of the window
Yeah but whether it will actually happen
or not I don't know I can hear some
disgruntled uh
voices there was the Hima committee
report that came out in Kerala I read it
at length it partly shook me up some
portions of it I was not surprised by
have you looked at it did it surprise
you I haven't read the whole report no
is that something that you found out of
ordinary or you felt that this is high
time that somebody looked at the
industry with this lens see I think it
is very important to see it because to
me a working woman's safety is very very
important if she's not safe in her place
of work then what is the message you're
giving go back to the kitchen and be
there so in every way safety is
something that we absolutely have to
focus
on I feel very concerned when my uh when
my staff if they're going late in the
night I make it a point to see that they
have uh transport to go
as so on a personal level you can keep
taking these things but I remember
having an experience many years ago in
uh Singapore it was 1:00 in the night
and I was walking back from from the
theater to my um to my hotel and I felt
completely safe and I said my God this
is what feminists mean when they say
take back the night yeah you know
because see getting wose fleshes I'm
telling you about it because there are
so many factors that we as a
society must take charge of and we
predators are there in every single
field wherever they will get a chance
they will do it but safety is something
that we have to ensure in our case the
film industry because that's where we
work
and you know on one hand I do think
that Evil societ film
industry because we are there to be
targeted but that's not saying it
doesn't happen yes and when it happens
what are we doing about it this is
something we absolutely have to take a
responsibility you've had uh a lot of
cor stars that you've seen through this
um you know through this journey of your
career Jane Fonda talks about how as
women our female friends are our power
because it's that Network and The
Sisterhood Network that takes us through
life is that your opinion and your
experience as well you know not to say
that uh
the idea made me get women friends but I
love women and uh I have very good girl
friends in the industry you know girls
whom I've worked with and then they
become my friends for life then I have a
whole circle of uh friends who are from
school Etc now we call ourselves L lagam
this is the name that jav has given us
because budy
and and so when we go to these uh uh
fabulous holidays together uh the one
one friends husband says no no you're
perfectly all right because uh all you
need to do is instead of walking forward
every five minutes or
so and then when we we had got to the
travel agent and he saw that everybody
was above 60 and nearly 70 mid 70 he
said but I mean I have just such a
fabulous time with my girlfriends I
can't tell you I I think it's just
absolutely lovely I mean this is at this
level but also people who are working um
in spaces when they're trying to work
with women getting empowered
that I think is very important because
alone how much can you struggle but if
you get into a group that gives you so
much so much strength I do want to ask
you about art though um again you're so
close to poetry and writing at home
uh do you feel that we still write the
way we used to in our industry I know
that there was a movement uh by Mr Raj
Kapur Sab to make the make the lyrics
and make the dialogue more accessible to
the average Indian write more Hindi than
Udu so people can learn it repeat it
make it part of themselves but have we
come very far from that course
abely inacessible Hindi
accessible U is hindustani just as much
as Hindi is
H if there's a word you can't understand
that's u h you
know Le in this
I I feel firstly very sad that the lip
sying song is
disappearing that's the way we tell
stories we tell stories through uh songs
if you look even at par theater
in this in this desire to be
International why should we give up
something which is so intrinsic to us
because if you look at what the songs of
the yester years did my God they were
little philosophies they gave you um way
to negotiate life uh if you had a
heartbreak you would have this song If
you were in love you'd have that kind of
song and you have a whole association
with it but
today we can't say that of any song I
mean there's a there's a beat to it I
don't think anybody pays attention to
the words anymore and then some words
are so
offensive that it leads
to horrible things you know but it leads
to sexualization of children and there
are these little children and they
singing These vulgar uh songs surely we
have to have some sense of that sense
what about the parents why are they
making their children you see so it's
society's uh responsibility not just the
film
indry what about them how are you
letting children dance these songs at
parties without having any idea what the
words are
do you feel that we're celebrating our
artists because you've also um you've t
with the prvi theater group when prv Raj
was there and your mother was there and
that was a different era of art are we
celebrating our artists like that
anymore are celebrating theater because
we now have the ability to do Bigger
Productions larger scale Productions but
is the art still
celebrated uh I would hate to say no but
it's in pockets it's not within the
mainstream in the mainstream I think we
lack original writing in theater and
because of that we're doing time and
tested things which we are getting in
Translation I don't have a problem with
translation because translation is the
only thing that makes these fabulous
things accessible but where is the
original writing some of it is emerging
there's some dalit writing which is
interesting there's some feminist
writing which is interesting but these
are little pockets but if you see
mainstream theater
it's it really leaves a lot to be
desired it's an expensive business to
watch theater because if you're paying
500 rupees for a ticket and it's a
family then
you so there's all that but but you know
I can't say that no you must think that
uh we should not watch Cinema we should
watch theater
but if our children have never watched
theater and they don't know what a live
performance is if they've never been to
a music concert they don't know so
they're missing out on a lot so then
they're only sitting in front of the
computer and then getting all their
stimulation from there it's inevitable
it will happen because that's what
happens with technology but if we can
also make a conscious effort to say that
we will expose our children to these
things also because I know that when
you're exposed to a certain things you
might rebel against it in your teenage
years I've seen that people who read are
people whose parents used to read people
who watch theater people who listen to
classical music all of them are people
who in their childhood was were exposed
to this I also say that
see Cinema
made if we have given no exposure to the
child towards what the better film The
Good film is for better the good film is
then at age 21 suddenly you want the
child to get up and say that yes I will
make a correct
Choice exposure to that's the least
that's the least that we need to do but
I can't
sayy don't show it to the child the
child will find ways but let the child
also learn that there are other things
of value not
just yeah I have to take him to the
T so right now I haven't taken him
because I don't believe he can sit still
for that much time and he'd be disrupted
but I'm sure in a couple of years we
should definitely try and there you know
living in exposure is all everything
yeah yeah it exposures everything and
living in um Bombay SL Mumbai there's
marati Theater which has such a large
footprint absolutely there's a lot of
folk theater that also happens if you
know where to find it so there is I mean
there's there are spaces we can take our
children yeah and and especially
classical music
especially music you
know keeps telling me that when he was a
child uh they couldn't afford great toys
or
anything all he used to do is roll
around in the compound and notice how
people talk and they would come back and
mimic all those people that's why he got
this
characters because he knows these people
he's observed them in childhood but so
you have to Javid keep saying that you
have to have children get bored because
that's where creativity will start not
just constantly give them stimulation of
the kind that their peer groups are
getting which is also inevitable you
can't do anything with school and all
that but I think parents need to make a
very special effort at 50 years of your
career right now what exciting you about
about your craft about your F you know
I've realized that what I like doing
most is being in front of the camera and
being on a film
set sort of journeyed from there and
everything but this is what I like the
most and for
me inhabiting another character's World
continues to be uh challeng ing thing so
there are various ways that I approach
apart you know sometimes I just glance
through the window and then close it
sometimes I open the door close it
sometimes I jump straight into the
drawing room I have different ways of
approaching uh a part and I think it's
the character that calls out to me and
says this is the way you should come
along with me now that a very exciting
in but a very um demanding it is very
very demanding so at this stage I think
what is important to guard against being
smug saying
that death nail for an actor death nail
and being smug saying that you
know will all that
my mother used to say
machine you have to feel it from within
otherwise it
doesn't work you know young aspirants
who want to start acting I tell them it
has to come from inside yeah you know it
can't be you admire shahu Khan so you'll
do the scene like Shah Khan you admire
Priyanka Chopra you're doing it like
Priyanka choa that's not what acting is
out it has to come from inside and
that's why for an actor it is very
important to keep drawing stimulus from
life itself because that is your
greatest resource base do you recommend
Young aspirants go to film school like
you did absolutely I think I I benefited
very very very greatly and firstly I say
don't do it when people come and say we
want to act don't do it yeah and then
they look very disappointed and I said
don't do it unless you will die if you
don't do it do it because you know it
is so
heartbreaking you know you go through
rejection on a daily
basis you've made a first film and
you've become a big star and all that is
that the guarantee that you're second
third and fourth film will also succeed
as you after Heart of Stone and
passion don't come because you think you
have a nice face or you can dance or you
have a
physique
extran all this body body body body yes
it's very important for a character but
not for all characters and that's not
where all the hard work is coming at
least that's how I I feel like when
I have uh done a part I did Monday I
went to three Brussels three of them you
know one in Bombay one in Delhi and one
in Hyderabad so wherever you can go and
find these real people it's not other
people's performance that should inspire
you it's real life the the body language
the language the just the it's an
automatic thing with an actor it's an
automatic uh thing I am talking to you
and I'm also absorbing how you're
looking at me what your uh finger
movements are everything it just comes
automatically but it is so frightening
way
because I remember
seeing the dead body of a friend and she
was in very small little cubicle like
that and I came from here and I
saw and I was full of grief and feeling
really really bad about it
but I noticed that her mouth had dropped
I said oh my god when I play a dead
person I do drop my mouth and so looking
at her fully with the grief I'm also
doing how mad is it so you can turn it
off how
schizophrenic is it my my God it
really you have to then actively make
yourself cut away from it just becomes
so part of what you're doing it can
almost sound cruel I remember that an
aunt of mine had lost her husband and I
went to meet her about 6 months later
and she was sitting across me and
speaking quite okay and then she started
doing this with her hand and she was
talking and she was just circling with
her hand and all that and all that at
one point she picked up her hand and she
started crying and I said wow how
wonderful would that be a g woman
actually tried to do it and you wonder
are you a human being or are you not so
you have to keep that part of you alive
and say that no this has to have second
place and you have to build uh balance
over there now in the new rules that are
offered whether you get a chance now to
imagine every single time you'll get
that challenge is not going to happen so
what from what you are offered you
decide that all right this is something
that I would like to give one year of my
life to and it has got nothing to do
with uh money or it's got nothing to do
younger filmmakers
excite me and
uh but I also like money so I like
getting money as well so there are many
many uh reasons but uh I would like to
keep acting uh till I die with my boots
on I can become uh an actor nobody in
the world wants to cast but I'm still an
actor and I will always remain one I
think that is my primary identity we
we've talked so much much about success
but in the in your career um has there
ever been moments of artistic burnout or
failure where you were just like I can't
do this anymore yeah there have been and
uh that's why I have sort of uh
said but I'll do theater because when I
went to the National Theater in London
which is a dream for every
actor I knew that I was like a newcomer
because people didn't know okay they
heard about me but they didn't know
anything and for me it was first it was
so strange because I was working in an
in uh in an English play and my English
sounded so quaint and so strange to me
now considering that I think English is
my first language and I think in English
suddenly I going into this atmosphere
and I'm saying my God how strange is my
English sounding so everything comes as
a fresh thing and you know a live
performance is an unbelievable
experience I don't think it can match
anything
else the the feeling at the pit of your
stomach and the fact that there's no
retake yes absolutely absolutely so
every time you felt disillusioned with
Cinema you've gone to theater not
necessarily I've done it
also along with it and all that but
there was only one period when I felt I
been B why what
happened I think I was just doing too
much work it was too much it was
becoming mechanical I was uh going doing
my lines coming back it wasn't exciting
me and then you know finally how much
work can an actor do
because though if for instance if I like
an actor very much and if I really keep
watching that actor a time comes when I
can predict every gesture I can say that
I know that she'll react like this and
so for myself only I was feeling this
right that okay now I know how I'm going
to do this
there's no fire in my belly that but I'm
telling you I went through different
stages But ultimately now after 50 years
I still say that I don't want much I
just and
more Shana ask me thank you so much it
was such a pleasure for speaking such a
pleasure thank you and you are so deeply
loved and so deeply celebrated all over
the country in many parts of the world
and um let me take this moment to speak
on behalf of everybody whose lives
you've changed with your work that your
art means so much to all of us thank you
thank Youk you thank you it means a lot
thank you
