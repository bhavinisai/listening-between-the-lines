i mean, my intention is that your future
husband, check out this podcast.
please see, it will be easy.
for the
since the world has learned the world pr
the world has not learned to shut up
there is so much negative pr. there are so
many attacks happened. book my show on twitter
rating, imdb's rating. people spend
a lot of money to pull people down.
telugu film industry is not very good from outside.
looks simple, clean and work oriented
is. am i right and saying that
what's the core reading of
like a lion like he can stand alone
rajinikanth
he is huge i mean people of tamil nadu will
go for this movie regardless of anything.
the film doesn't matter.
what is the code of prabhas?
pure. the nicest person i've met in
my life. not in the industry in life.
feeling very peaceful around you.
but i'll tell you something ranveer at a very
very very low face of my life. i bang
my head on the wall in kashi literally my
crown chakra and i don't know what
happened but my life changed after that.
oh wow. are you single now?
yes.
what is attractive personality trade?
is it?
stability and dependability. it's someone
you need to be able to make life decisions
with. from a decision of where to live to a
ventilator decision. that i feel is very
variant.
the best relationship you have ever had
my first one.
in school
i someone dumped you.
i've been dumped but i've been cheated on.
it was so difficult for me to understand
because who ever i have dated before. i never
ever felt like ok, i want marry this
person.
was partner famous?
one with the angels of the telugu world
the podcast is starting. so start
i would just like to say that this roju mana
special guest unnaru nidhi agarwal garu.
oh wow i thought i would like hindi
i have to speak and you spoke in telugu.
ok. great. by the way your telugu very
it is good.
thank you. thank you.
thank you ranbir for that introduction. no,
the pleasure having you here. so much to say
to you. very pumped, looks very good
has been. a i think very fun conversation
it will happen today.
i think it will be a little genuine because
you are very genuine. i think so my. so
i am meeting you for the first time in my life.
are you sure we are meeting for the first time. v
have never bummed into each other.
oh great. lovely to meet you.
same beans. and that's why i told you to me
not allowed to talk.
yes. so maybe ranveer has a process. or
he's a method podcaster.
or or because i felt that people were genuine
consume podcasts for vibes
or
because the world has become lonely.
absolutely
people are lonely.
a lot
are you lonely?
honestly yes i think we all feel a bit off
loneliness and definitely i really feel like
in the best and worst moments you are alone
you just happen. so you just have to learn to
deal with that. isn't it? because in the lowest of
lows end in the highest of highs, if you
notice you are always alone.
because no one can feel that low and that high
with you, they can feel a certain level of
emotions with you but no one can really feel
what you're feeling you know when you're
very low and very high edge well.
hmm when you are very high age well.
or what about us actors like i mean sea?
it happens ranvi and i notice this. so my
the film has just been released. i'm just
telling you the feeling that you feel very much
feels adrenaline. very one you know
every stage you go to people are screaming
for you they are cheering you know for you people
are like loving to give you attention at that
point of time because you have a release coming
up. so that point up until the release is a
very high in your mind. you know and then with
the release you thought came back to normal. and
and if it's good it means if it's bad the
result then you go lower. so it's the low end
why i feel like a public person but
especially as an actor because the world is
open na, everyone has one voice. one account for all
is.
inside everyone
everyone actually has 10 accounts each. isn't it?
so
and the era of pr is going on.
this is the era of pr.
the era of pr games is going on. about this
i shouldn't talk. i would love to
because or should talk.
since the world has learned the world pr
the world has not learned to shut up.
i completely agree with you and i really
what do people feel like?
opinions have always been there. it's just that
you don't know them.
now everyone has access to tell you
what they feel. and everyone has
conflicting opinions. so its
extremely confusing as to what to do
what to listen to and what not to listen to.
you know the opinions are great. but you know
you know i feel that i think three levels of pr
is we
level one is what we thought in the last 10
learned over the years
that pr is an associated skill
from media career
right right
after for whatever reason the world is no longer like this
pr skills have been understood
absolutely
so even when you go to reddit, everyone
discussing pr games
or reddit is a new world for me guys.
i recently discovered ready
bb worst than twitter
or because
may happen
identity remains completely hidden
so people can do anything
anything anything and i think there are certain
people who are on reddit also with other names
butt or people are people
by the way we have a genji with us rohan annie
quick genji opinions on reddit and pr
i would love to know
or so people are very
aware about if the pr is happening
aw not means anything if pr campaign comes
nowadays people of bollywood or any movie
guess it like it couldn't happen before 10
a year ago but now people are very easy
to guess that oh this is a pr campaign and this
is a natural campaign and recently also very
all the campuses have been set up and people have gathered there immediately.
let's gas
or ok
but in away i feel that's a good thing if
people are able to catch that
this is not genuine, this is pr, i actually
feel that's nice
or i i hope.
isn't it?
i hope people are able to catch it i think
people are able to catch positive pr very easily
that yes they have done pr.
but when someone's negative pr over the mass
it happens doesn't it
yes
i think our world understands that this
fabricated.
yes
because we are media professionals
absolutely
the audience feels this is a genuine
negative
no but you know something so negative pr
there are so many attacks that happen
even something like book my show rating
imdb rating on twitter with the
media you know there's a certain section of
there is a lot of negativity in paid reviews.
and people spend a lot of money to pull people
down. i feel sometimes we'll spend more
money to pull people down then lift
themselves up.
we
recently one or two happened to me too. even
the negative campaign that started.
just tell me the name.
that's it, isn't it? but we stopped it immediately
because i was just like dude. i'm gonna
push myself in a good way. but if you do
something negative than i'm gonna do it right
back.
i will not take names. a very famous and
powerful man said it's a billionaire from
our legacy billiard family. right? he
said he learned this 10 20 years ago
self defense in our world
learning from a pr perspective that's too
it is necessary.
very very very
don't attack anyone else.
i agree with you. do good to yourself.
great. but don't you know do something negative
for someone else. that's your intention again
that's your karma. do negative.
i really feel that. isn't it? but this is you and me
are saying. and you know i have generally seen
that there are no two types of people in the media
are. i like it a lot here
why did you do this?
money
i don't talk about money, i talk about hearts.
was doing. you
i mean or unfortunately i actually feel
like media is very powerful. a lot
it is more powerful. and people this
don't understand. but the industry is
the media is we're all in the same boat. if the same
if you make holes in the boat, you will accidentally destroy everyone.
there is loss.
not from outside telugu film industry
very simple, clean and work oriented
looks like.
am i right and saying that
or i think you're 70% right. i think when
it comes to actors, directors, film
feeling in making, production, all those things
there's a lot of sincerity, there's a
lots of passion, lots of love, lots of one
rootedness is you know in cinema and they
really love shooting. meaning there if you
just go on shoot, nobody really cares that
okay, this is my job. i'm just
gonna do this. no, everybody is involved in
the process and everyone wants to do there
best. so it's a very homely chilled out
yet very productive environment but i feel
like or there's just a certain section of
again this is paid media but there are genuine
people age well but very few
or like i was saying that i felt two types
are media professionals who
the inner child is alive who
i have done this and
i'm so surprised to speak about inner
child because i've been working on that
lot
hmm and the second one is the section which is over
is competitive and they have their own
there is a glimpse of insecurities.
absolutely.
they make this mass scale negative
pr.
yes.
shout out to kartik aryan. shout out to
varun dhawan.
or
shout out to rohan.
these two are people. i've seen a lot of
videos also many influencers
mails are going to. they should be given money
are you negative about them?
post it.
o really?
or this becomes a new.
it's really bad. or. so i am my mother's
was sitting together yesterday. and i asked him
have you heard anything about karthik
aryan late and he said i know
there was some controversy, this reached them
this thing is over, they don't know which one
kind of pr mechanism behind this
but people spend a lot of money on this
too much and it's so horrible i feel
because leave all this means leave the money leave the
leave what people think but that's particular
persons and actors are very very sensitive
very emotional, very childlike
they happen from within. so i felt like him
it's really not good for mental health.
you know you feel attacked.
the counter argument is that you
is fame oriented and has chosen now
endure bad mental health.
public personality is not public property
it happens, right? this is a slight difference
in this.
this is your humanity talking.
yes.
but not everyone has humanity.
and what happens now as we go home
we also have parents, everyone means you
know you are answerable to your parents you are
answerable to your family they have their circle
of friends it's or it's not nice
i feel or
honestly, i don't care about these two brothers.
feeling very bad for. guy's weed end
karthik r and varun dhawan
and and they are very genuine people so i
no both of them a little bit. i don't know
them too well. and varun is a very child
like person, very sweet, very encouraging.
meaning it encourages new comers a lot
varun. and even karthik i think has worked
very hard you know to get where he is.
so why?
or i have many things to tell you.
yes please.
and one of two things is kind of related
to varun dhawan also.
ok.
ok. i feel very good about you
sitting in front. not because of your energy.
it's great energy. you're so nice.
thank you. i've done my healing today. so
i think may be that's reflecting.
it means you are feeling very relaxed.
around.
but i will tell you something ranveer. avery
single person tells me this. so i'm into
a lot of reiki. i do a lot of meditation
and i feel i'm very spiritual
connected.
you know. i mean it's just one of those things.
but this is the most important and
strongest relationship i think in my
life. and every person tells me this.
work positive. work positive sweet. so sweet
i have to take myself out of it. i want
to become a bit more you know just they know yours
sheet.
yes, i'm tired of being sweet
now. butt or sex and positive. these two
things i get the most.
i actually tell you about your hair care routine.
and ask about skin care routine
was going to. but you answered it.
good. or you do reiki healing yourself.
i do. i do it every day.
people who have not met a reiki healer yet
and those who have not experienced reiki
kara you don't know what it's like being
around a
reiki practitioner lives in ora.
or i'm completely okay with you. infarct
i started reiki at a very
very very low face of my life personally not
professionally. professionally everything was very
high at that point of time.
no 206 no very recently.
ok. in 2018 i thought of going to kashi.
later spiritually
i bang my head on the wall by chuck literally
my crown chakra and i don't know what
happened but my life changed after that in
kashi so that was something that really opened up
the world of spirituality god self
connection and introspection all of that
magic you know all of these things so that
happened but ah reggie is a very recent thing
in my life and a very personal low face
i didn't have an option but to just work
on myself you know work on my inner child
and work on feeling positive and being positive
and i'm the kind of person i don't give up
i believe if i know that i am okay
feeling this way i'll solve it i'll do
whatever it takes to make myself feel
better to make myself feel happy too
bring my own vibration up i won't
accept defeat ever in life
yes, yes.
but really i mean that it takes a lot of
energy. i think to do that. but i do it
and i consciously do it.
we started with telugu.
yes and you spoke very good telugu.
thank you.
actually i had to tell you thanks
for reaching out. a just when i had got
back into my house.
last year.
or
whatever happened last year. i was frazzled
what do you say in hindi? just hill.
was shaken.
was shaken. yes
and i was just sitting at home and i
wasn't even coming out. for a couple of months
didn't leave the house. i worked out and
everything was kept at home. i just went to my apartment
was in and very few slabs reached out
was. over time lots reached out.
but you're may be the first and second person
who reached out when i came back home.
ah and you just said you know just believe in
the future. so thank you for the digital
healing.
thank you ranbir. and no about ranbir about
i have to say that i have been i am yours
i have been watching the podcast for many years because
i feel like you're so genuine and you talk
about topics that people don't dare to you
know you have in a way encouraged a whole generation
to kind of be spiritual to believe in
make these kinds of things cool again you know
and i feel like that's really real
all the things you are doing are one thing
cause you can't negate that i mean what you
have done sun is a million times more. you know
so everyone makes mistakes but it's yours
intention and your heart is where you are
beautiful heart.
so you should be loved for that.
thank you so much. takes one to no one.
thank you.
what i will definitely say is to me
i felt very emotional from that message. i
don't want to get into details of that
because that's private life. butt you a lot
amthi darhai and i am actually emotional
he read that ok there's another
i am a media celebrity professional.
understands the trials and is reaching
out with empathy thank you thank you that you
just understand my prediction
ya ya i can't even imagine what that
phases we've been like for you but you know
what i think i saw after that too
there are certain times in life
where you just have to learn a lot of lessons
you know you have to balance out certain karmas
in life and it was just one of dose
things and you come out bigger, better,
stronger. and i think people have seen that
something like that can't face you out. you know
because of all the good that you have done.
thank you.
so your plus bank is very big.
thank you, thank you. discuss a lot
is with you. genuinely. where does it begin?
do from? can i, can i recommend like one
possible starting point?
am where from hair care routine skin care?
no. i don't remind. what is your hair
care routine?
honestly my hair care routine is nothing.
i do coconut oiling sometimes because
my hair is normally very straight and
very flat. so the flat thing is mine
problem. but i think hair is one thing
genetically my mother has better hair than me?
o really?
so does my sister?
what is better than this?
yes, so does my sister? i mean this much
after styling it becomes a bit
different. but in school i remember seniors
used to come and touch my hair. and be like
oh my god your hair is so soft. i came to sleep
think hair is just minimal care. i don't
believe in hair spas, masks. i'm very
all school like that.
honestly, i am getting healing from your voice too.
to the listeners. so i felt that inside you
something is happening inside due to which the skin
care, hair care, voice care, routine is
taking care of itself.
ya ranveer, i just feel like kabhi mein life
only one thing is subsent. that is
intention. what is your intention? you know that
i am an actor. why am i an actor? i
why am i working? is it for the money?
is it for the fame and i've asked myself
these questions. i've journaled it out.
and it's not that. even if i got paid
nothing. even if i got no fame with this
profession. i'd still love to do it.
because that child there is this child
inside me. that was just obsessed with
becoming an actress. not knowing the perks
and the negative things that come with it. butt
intention,
hmm.
always go to intention.
what is going on inside?
just my film has just been released
raja saheb with prabhas sir and it's
doing very well our opening i'm gonna
talk numbers i hope that's okay
god go
but why not right so our opening was 112
croshers that's day one when premieres
and all were canceled but still you know he got
too he got two figures and the film is in the
theaters it's doing great weekend numbers will
b200 plus so i'm feeling really happy
i'm feeling grateful
but somewhere kya hai na a jab picture
is it released? that whole day is like a
roller coaster
because every review you see, every tweet you see
every instagram thing you see somewhere it
affects you and you get confused
what he is saying is very good, he is saying this.
he is saying ok, he is saying very useless.
what does it mean so i feel again you have to
just go back to your intention you have to go
back to yourself that i had to do this
i liked it, after that it's up to people.
what they think and a little disconnect too
have to do what i'm learning to do
butt delete me twitter for that
which i really thought of this eye
thought of tweeting you guys don't deer meter
i i feel at some times i feel like they
don't deer someone who is not genuine
faking it and i don't believe in the sing off
fake it til you make it they say
or or
i don't believe i feel you can't fake it till
you make it
you know and in saying i agree you can't
fake it to you make it
but a lot of the same back to paid pr so much
there is more fake projection.
very much very much
meaning even people in the world of youtube
subscribers buy views.
are.
absolutely views comments
everything na
or like we know something like internally woven
running this for 10 years. we have an internal
took the call that we will never buy followers.
don't need to say but then you see the whole
industry doing
and then you just question whether it is
true that good guys finish last
ranveer this is my biggest existential
crisis
in life that you know do good things happen to
good people tell me the answer today
i guess your intentions are not only seen by god.
can
i completely agree
and there is a very famous quote i can't remember.
said this but it goes like if you try saying
the truth. people will call you a muftar. but you
must say the truth anyway. if you feel like
you've made wrongs and apologized people will
blame you for the apology but you must
apologies anyway. because in the end its
not between you and people. it's between you
and god anyway.
and this is something i live by everything
i believe is between you and god. which is
why you don't need to explain anything
to anyone. yah. i think divine justice
there is a thing called name. attach to the pr
conversation. even little things like an eye
think that if a person does not read all the time reddit
or on twitter
will go mad.
yes. if someone is spreading acid, that too is karma.
it is only there. all that's also going to come back to there
life.
it is karma. so, watch out, yes, all of you,
who are doing this, it will hit you but it will
because you are literally and you know what ranbir
people don't understand this. ok? just one
is a producer. they don't understand
that many producers have lost all
there money. literally come on the streets because
they have invested their house and
everything. so they literally come on so you are
playing with people's careers. you are
playing with their livelihoods, you are
playing with their income, you're playing with
there's family, they're playing with there
mental health. so, and every person is
responsible for that.
tell me about any imperfection you have
took. oh, there are many.
i feel like a very sorted out person
i am.
i am sorted out from outside. i feel mine
the biggest imperfection is that i can't
i have become incapable
of a putting out my mood. meaning if it is assumed
i'm upset and i'm angry. and i am
irritated and something has disturbed
m. i became incapable of expressing that.
it just becomes in my head it becomes like
this thing of someone did this okay it's it's
gone to like lessons what lesson does this give me
got it's just gone to that so it's good
for others but it's not good for me you know
because it just keeps getting piled up and
i don't know that when it bursts i know
at some point it will which is why i
journal to just get it out but you know what
the trickiest part is even when i'm
journaling i'm still ending the statement
with a positive line and i'm like why
am i not able to write what i'm feeling
even to myself even when i know no one
gonna read it you know how i've become so
private
private or ultra positive or are not
able to accept that something is affecting
m
emotional loneliness
yes loneliness back to the loneliness where we
started or
we
but this happens because of the age of yours.
family loves you and mind really supports
me you know, please be in many of my decisions.
it wasn't normal decisions like going out of the house
go and try the world of acting.
no to get a first film let alone stay to
may be get married at a later age all of this
things are not normally accepted
things especially in a house like mind
but they always understood me but certain
things they can't understand and you don't
want to put that load on them here
it's going very deep, isn't it?
no its fantastic man. it's fantastic.
you have so much to say. honestly like
look at whatever tangent i can see in my mind.
let's go, i will tell you.
yes.
when your name is written on our schedule
gone.
my team always asks me that you
where to record. home recording
is this or this studio.
hmm.
nowadays, very few of us own these studios.
opening for.
and our internal role is that s for s
it is possible that this is only for powerful women.
let's open the studio.
that's amazing. powerful woman i.e.
in which there is more goddess element.
wow how lovely thank you.
so thank you.
i didn't even have to think. a when your
saw the name and immediately chose this studio.
thank you. how sweet. i mean how sweet and
from how a divine eye was. thank you. thank you
for that.
don't know why and i feel that you
you will bless the studio and go. thats
why only. 100% no but my good my
everything good is always there you know for you
and of course the studio i love it. here
the vibe is very positive. and it really
feels like means a little bit
feels pressure sometimes. there is zero
pressure that i feel, there's zero judgment
that's what i feel.
like you know honestly, collectively, i i
know my guys too very well. we all want
to give you something, but we don't know what to
give you.
just give me love.
good good vibes.
just give me love. ok
yes
that you have
just love or i'm always like or just love
or do gifts look good?
love feels better
what is your love language
very good question, i used to think that
oh my god, earlier i used to feel like my love.
language was
words of encouragement are spoken, right?
like positive things but now i think about me
looks like my love language is action
we
like in my head not just a man but
especially a man is someone who does what he
says he'll do that's a man
so just that
back up your words with action
yes that if you're saying you're gonna do it
do it otherwise don't say it
you know
so you don't want gifts
love
you need love
words are needed and actions are needed
i need actions, i don't need words right now
need words
well, i have lost my faith.
ok. things to impress a lot of people
say.
yes. and i feel like people mean. so i have
learn this one thing in reiki it is said that
emotion is energy in motion.
oh wow.
so even when you feel love for someone right?
it's moving energy. you feel it at a
certain moment and then it moves away. and
then you feel something else. so you can't take
that particular emotion and base your whole life
off of one emotion from someone else. because that
emotion is energy in motion, it always changes.
will happen. you know that's why the word pe se mera
not interested anymore.
i mean, my intention is that your future
husband, watch this podcast.
please see, it will be easy. for me too
it will be easy. i don't have to
indirectly say a lot of things. you know
it will just be clear.
you want this?
wedding
nice husband.
i want a very good husband. i
think there are many good people in the world
great man in this world and my father
being one of them. but yah, there are some
great wonderful man in this world. and i
believe that this will happen. i don't know why but i
always have this image of a very nice
positive, work, ah, stable,
dependable, man, next to me. with lots
off dogs off you kids.
lots of dogs. or. i love dogs. so,
lots of dogs. i do a lot of work for
dogs like us well, but we'll talk about that
letter butt or. i have this visual in my
mind.
doesn't sound like anyone from my industry.
really? or.
or but i love dogs. like, i have my
the ultimate ngo type of dreams are to do
with dogs, which i'm already working
on. i wish i could do it. butt or butt either
the answer is yes. does anyone want this? i think
you will get it at the right time, right now, i have come.
don't have anyone like that in my life
there is no feeling of looseness in our industry.
to find a compatible person from the
the industry is very difficult because we
there is too much chaos in everyone's world.
there are too many cases and i feel like somewhere
but purity is a relationship.
somewhere i feel that it's missing not
just in our industry but in many places
need a love right now
there is a relationship right
we
just pure relationship with no other intentions
and just love acceptance
or i felt like our grandparents
generation's love was different
yes
from our generation
absolutely meant a lot of acceptance.
i thought ranveer then
we
it's theirs but chasing perfection that's mine
partner should be perfect. you know there
there is no perfection. it was just acceptance.
this is what is mine. you know it was literally
like that. and that's what i feel love
eventually you know.
or and you know correct me for wrong. i think
were roughly in the same age group.
i think so.
butt
ah someone once said on i think show
that arranged marriages are not always good
would have happened. when the butt is better than you
you learn to love.
i agree.
and this is a very grown up take on love that
very true
because
irrespective of who you date you a lot
be very frustrated with them in moments
will go. that's about getting passed the
frustrated.
absolutely. and i felt what happens
in arranged marriages. so i am someone who is
open to arranged marriages as well. letter
let's see but i know it's shocking but genji
what you have to say about this can't connect
no
two extremes but you know i have noticed that
i've been hanging out with like these
really young group of people now days i never
thought i'd get along with them but i i
iiiiiiiiiiiii actually or i feel
they are very sensitive
or very strong personalities you can
always find a group which suits
or i was surprised because i
usually got along with older people.
or
but i was surprised to get along with
like 23 years old. and i'm like this what
is happening?
i think their knowledge of ai has advanced a lot.
because of. content powered by ai
also.
absolutely.
like these people are reading a lot more than us
at that age.
yah.
and they learn quickly. like we are
talking as people in our 30s are saying that
man in our 30s we learned this. 22 years old
watching this can gain that value at 22.
and their level has become very high.
that's what i feel. it became higher than
sum of the people. i know of my age. and even
older than me. i feel like there is equal
actually very very high.
why would you write high e in your resume?
what should i write in my resume? i
i will write
simple woman.
simple.
simple woman.
means simple.
just butt you are not naive.
no.
you are sharp. i'm smart but innocent but
not dumb. i am not dumb.
do you know what?
you are marwari.
that is absolutely right. you know i have
become ranveer. i have become so good with
accounts. i feel that my
it's the genetics of marwariness, right now
kicking in.
i have become very good with accounts. i
was never good at accounts, money, none of it.
i mean, i haven't got paid for half the
things that have done. but suddenly not mine
the accounts have been switched on. i became
too good at it.
that inner super power has been unlocked.
it has been unlocked. or nice
all about the money.
or it's also i think marwari is not one
definitely extremely good with money and all
that. like the stereotypes people know
are.
or
another stereotype that you just
you know when you have marwari friends
around. that you guys are really sorted out
friends to have. you're very nice
friends.
yah.
o really? or no stereo shenanigans at all
is. it is marwari community. that's why the
community is the soul in business also because
integrity pays off in the lord.
integrity yes. absolutely.
there is a lot of integrity. meaning in front of you
i feel very safe just sitting here.
you are safe.
but this general sitting in front of every marwari
feels. that you know there is high
integrity.
or there's high integrity and somewhere
there's always like, an investment
from a marwari brain if i have to think.
everything is investment isn't it? so
we always consider investments as long term.
let's see. don't see short term.
same with friendships
you know you always invest in friendships
so that it becomes long term.
hum human
yes yes which variant. i figure
recently how important friendships are
in life.
and they really are.
even dhirubhai ambani and reliance generali
one of their main company cultures is to give
really take care of the people. it's the same
logic long term business grow because of
great very deep relation.
or i'll tell you one small story about
my dad. so at his work i don't know why
remember that but i think he was telling me
this that in some meeting is some gay made some
mistake and then he was a bit rude to him.
a bit rude for him is normal. meaning our
will be normal. he talks like us.
and the next day he went back and he
apologized to the same guy in front of
everyone in the office. you know that you am
really sorry yesterday i shouldn't have said
that's to you so i think it's things like
that you know where your respect grows in
front of the people that you work with well
so i think things like that are variant the
the way you treat people
kal cultural thread of integrity
yes yes
if you ever go to rajasthan
no
someone from my family means rajasthan.
is not
but you have gone for a walk
no surprisingly not
what kind of a marwari
isn't it? i haven't gone to my roots.
why not?
i don't know, it never happened. meaning my parents
have gone but i for some reason never got the
opportunity has to go, i will go.
do you like travelling?
feels good.
ok.
where do you normally go?
so i love going to holiday. i love
going to london.
ok.
i don't know why but i think indians love
london.
and and and
don't know what it is.
meaning there are many things in london. a lot
there is culture and entertainment too.
and it's a little bit you feel nice also
a bit like india. lots of indian food
it's good in london.
dishoom
yes dishoom what else? tamarant.
or or
tamarind is also very very good. gym
food also very good.
very iconic indian restaurant.
or so i love going to london and india
like the jyotirlinga places.
spiritual places.
religious travel. yes, religious travel me
like it very much. or
let me share a tangent with you. youtube
careers do not survive or grow
due to reinfection.
right?
it's like a muscle you're always working at
back of head king what new should i do now? new
what should i do?
so our new thing is documentaries.
and the easiest way for me to do
the documentary is. i love traveling
it seems. and i've been to very crazy places
i am going. i have gone. butt shoots everywhere
haven't done it. about my bus places
have to go.
right? so since i think the last two three
months since we started this new project.
it's a documentary project where we
anthony borde goes to the corners of the country
creating a style travel show.
but the core of it is righteousness.
religious
because india has so many religious places
in.
a lot
like this is a witchcraft practitioner this week
came on the show. which crafting
also interesting or meaning dark white wicca
it happens.
so he said that in global wicca
where is their main temple?
where?
in osa.
dew. yes. osa has a lot of temples and
everything.
or an it's called a 64 yogini temple. its
a round temple which is open. and jo main
there's an idol there's an idol of something
called mahamaya.
mahamaya.
mahamaya is the same entity that every wickan
press two. which is mother nature. same is mother
nature. or or
so i'm like there's so much left too
explore there is i think in india
there's so much left to explore there's so much
much left to i think even for people to know
that these places exist you know the
the smallest of the smallest places have the
most powerful temple some of them if there
talk to a local and they will tell you
this place is very very powerful
or it is said that banaras is the most
traveled to place has been completed. that's so
true i getal or
like once you go there you get why
completely
or when we were growing up we were told
about like all these places
true true true what is ours singapore
go to singapore go to usa
yes dubai singapore usa or
now suddenly genz is discovered banaras
i just saw this video i don't know it
if it was ai video a normal video but
they like these kids jenzie kids doing a
bhajan party
but without alcohol obviously but it was a
bhajan party and i was like someone invited
me too this please.
i'd love to do that.
that exists?
are you in bombay off?
no not really. meaning my hindi pictures
if there are two then when it starts.
okay okay. but where do you live then?
great question. so i'm from bored.
ok. i shifted to bombay. i b eight
years ago when i wanted to get into
films to try to become an actor
auditions. to do all that. i was here
for a year. in that one year i got my first
got the picture. and after that i stead
here for two years before covid went back
to bore after covid shifted to hyderabad.
so now i came in hyderabad. so my little
pan india also happened.
yes pan india pan india has become a bit
say it's a bit complicated.
pan india life.
pan india life sorry one kind of meme
kind of which is kind of compliment
for you. from the hole team. ok? so every
we do a lot of research for our guests.
what things can we do?
open a core thought associated with you that
if someone goes to a very advanced chatbot and
say hey ai please create me an indian
beauty it will create something like nidhi
agarwal
how sweet
that you seem to be ai generated but actually you
be real it's a compliment
listen i feel the same way sometimes when i
look at my own pictures i'm like this is
looking like ai ranbir what is wrong with
m |
no it's a good thing
is it
or or definitely models in your face
i like the train
because i'm even i feel this
may be may be it's like sketching ora and
something i don't know
it's something with the face and i don't
what it is but i feel this is well
it's a compliment
than great thank you
sorry i had to get out of my head
these somewhat random tangents
i am a robot
yes maybe
a
maybe i'm a robot
do you know that robots are going to become a
thing now already already happening in the west
is.
have you ever seen the jetsons cartoon? the jetsons?
no.
see the flint stone?
the flint stone was set in stone. jetsons
was set in the future.
oh great.
where for vehicles it is like a flying
used to come in the car.
those won't be tyres.
yes it's like
shit, what will happen to our business then?
i didn't think flying cars were also coming.
that means so many science and technology podcasts.
i have done it. recently. it's crazy
what will happen in the next 5 years
is.
i think even like in the next 5 years
actors will not have to act because
everything will be ai. that's what everyone
we all talk about all the time.
as far as i understand what you are saying
that's right. a black mirror episode of salma haye
where is this.
yes. he is very famous and everyone knows the episode.
must see.
black mirs.
like there are two types of butts in america.
there are fruits and vegetables. one
contains organic vegetables and a
inorganic. yes.
i feel that ai generated content of any
kind is going to be treated as
inorganic.
inorganic and then organic will have more
value.
or because some such human nuisances,
there are expressions that cannot
can't do it. i completely agree with you
gotta see the butt.
isn't it?
excited and scared of the future.
excited?
excited?
excited. because see not like i can
control it. whatever has to happen will happen. rather
be excited for it. what you want to have
children in this world?
i've always wanted to have children.
i think as a child i've always wanted
to have children. seriously like i always
thought that you know i'll adopt a kid like
how sushmita say and that memory is very
deeply imprinted in my mind. but no i
want to have kids.
give me some extra time to race,
attention, creating a different world
will have to. which also might not be good
actually butt
meaning
meaning, how will i create a different world?
will they adapt to this world
o ok
so i've got to keep them in reality some way
isn't it
how to make a child strong
yes
ok
but no i want to have kids
we
lots of kids
lots of kids
lots of kids
how many
three four
why are you ready for four kids?
i don't know, i always wanted children.
think i've always been a mother so my
sister seven years younger than me. and my
parents didn't plan on like having a
second child. give it like ok another full
stop. but i remember writing letters. income
want a baby sister and keeping it in the
pooja room every day. and
manifested.
very and i literally thought that god had
scent me you know my sister. so i came
literally like every help. as like a seven eight
year old kid. i used to take care of her
so much. and even today we don't fight my age
the gap is too much. but she is like my baby. you know. i don't see her like my sister. so i came
have all i have a lot of that motherly
instinct feeling.
elder or i really have that in me. so
even in a group of friends i and up
becoming the caretaker like i just make
sure everybody is safe and everybody is you
no good.
your friends treat you like a famous person
let's treat.
no.
no.
no.
how to treat?
i think very normally i have two groups
of friends. one is a fun group that you know
we just hang out. we go i have had
alcohol in the last six years. so that
part of my life is kind of done. butt eye
mean yah. so i have a friend group like a
chill group that i hang out with some times.
but i've liked certain friends who've been
my friends for like 20 22 years.
so we need more for like coffees and greens
t and stuff like dat and we really have you
no we speak a lot. we're in touch. butt v
don't share much of our work stuff. so we talk
about everything other than work.
why did you stop drinking?
i don't know why but at some point, you know,
i just started feeling not good when
i drank alcohol. i started feeling a
little bit of anxiety i didn't enjoy
it. i started feeling panicky and then
i'm like, okay, so i'm not liking
dec. my body is not accepting it.
yah, it's rejecting it almost. i came to sleep
was like that's ok ban stop. so no
alcohol, no partying, clubbing. i mean
i like to hang out with people but there is
just no alcohol involved with me. give can
drink butt
like there is a saying about millennials that the
same people who are going to clubs and
partying when they are 18 and 19 are going
for kirtans and meditation
i started drinking when i was 14
i don't mean started drinking. i liked it
i've had alcohol and all when i was
14 so
why?
school? like the people around
fun school going out
rebelliousness
yes it was fun at that and at that point of
time in school college it was fun
used to enjoy myself you know when i
was drinking but after a point it
started becoming a panic
we
we have a nice face of partying for 10
years i realize okay time to grow up
that's enough let's grow up or
we or and i see the same pattern a lot me
there are two types of millennials around me.
one like you who chilled. i
i am also in the same category.
oh great. so you have also stopped.
partyed very hard. but at this
point can imagine.
find party in green tea itself.
absolutely. or green tea a good episode
of friends talking to your friends. u
no sleeping at night, waking up early
going for a walk. this is life and this is
fun.
or or
isn't it? or or
chatting with another millennial friend of mine
i felt like an athlete of our age.
not everyone in the group is going back to what.
give enjoy s kids
i think so
and that's different for different people
or anyway but it's friends for some people
like for me it's become a lot of i've
getting back in football and playstation it
sounds
but i balance
but what's immature about it i think it's
great even if you see, all of yours
senses, it's like even people who raise, they
practice so much of that thing na. what
what's that call?
whatever he is, he trains. i i think
it's great.
by the way, you are also a gamer. i know you
played pubg.
i played a lot of pubg in lockdown. i have
also abused people a lot. it was so much
fun. you know, i was like, this is so much fun.
we are talking to random people for bihar,
from here to there. is like, great.
are you good at pubg?
i thought i was good. i am goods
so basically what is my school?
thee o great lovely i love talking about my
school it was a way different kind of school
christ
no christ was not a good
experience for me it's a great college but
or so my school we didn't have exams
till the seventh eighth standard then our
we didn't have exams, we didn't have projects.
var given but i still rot my 10th
icsce
how much did you get
88 no exams given projects v
had so much so much of sport, so much of
extracurriculars. so we are
constantly on stage, speaking on stage
and dancing and performing and something or the other
other. and we had every sport possible
swimming, skating, football, cricket,
badminton, sculpture, yoga. i am a yoga
interstate winner also. was now, i'm not
that flexible butt ah ya. so, we had
every sport possible. and girls and
guys used to play the same sports. guy's
used to do sculpture as well and girls
used to play cricket and hockey and
football as well you know so my school is the
best was school it was called vidyashilp
the meaning of academy is still there, it has changed a little.
is bored
vidyashilpedamy
vidya shisilp academy lovely school to
there was a lot of focus on extracurriculars
always and even study means our studies
we used to understand it because
there was no concept of mugging up and
writing because you had to create a
project so you had to understand what
you're studying. now if we are reading
civics so we had to make it important
parties we really had to do that you know so
you understand every step of how it
functions
we like deep understanding
ya so no exams na
were you a front bencher or a back bencher?
back
in the back or
that energy is like it's very front right now
bencher energy is yours but i can tell some
evolution
or i think so or back but i've always been
a very sweet girl like i've been naughty
but very sweet because my parents were
always like they can call us to school it's
okay but don't do anything bad you can
naughty but you can't be bad
you used to assist
yes i mean what was my meaning of laughing
eating sneaky food you know that kind of
ever stupid
copied in test
no
no
no i didn't copy it
that's the real taste
meanness is necessary in life
a no
no
no
no should be nice
i think you should be right like i know
today in today's world everybody believes that
there is no right and wrong there is gray
and somewhere even the divine says that but maybe
i haven't reached that level yet
certainly believe there's a right and there
is a wrong
you know
so copying is unethical
no that's fine that's fine it's a
small thing that walks c sometimes u
copy sometimes you help your friends
also not by showing them
that's how i look it correct
so so what
correct
it's it's great it's friendship it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
not bad
the one who knows
the things are not counted
because of a brother in engineering college
i passed and those who sat behind me
used to tell a lot in the exam hall
so every year i message you saying thank you
because of you have a youtube career
really so you have a lot of gratitude
inside you
siddharth bhadani and that and you are welcome too
say. i really feel kim a you because of
that cow.
how sweet. you know it's good to give
credit. i think that's me and that shows
how nice you are. you know that you have so much
of gratitude.
yes, that means i feel that every person's life
i have neither weak faces nor strong faces
there are phases.
100 graphs right? up, down, up.
that is the same graph.
you are in astrology na.
i mean i am. i believe in astrology.
i used to wear a couple of rings and all
which i took all of them out. u u u u
yu yu yu. ah, so that i stopped doing.
you know your own chart?
i know my chaat.
you have strong fat on. i have a you
so good. so i have a very very strong
saturn a very strong exalted speak
is it jupiter?
and rahu very very strong rahu rahu
10th
saturn 11, rahu 10 and jupiter, don't forget the address.
gone fourth or fifth or sixth something
we
so you also have something like that
learning it's learning the energy but i
think it's like a media professional thing
to have a strong rahu
rahu i have heard say rahu 10
world here just recently someone told me
that
you know people think that rahu is a
the villainous thing is the butt in someone's chart.
have you ever seen the spiderman movie?
is mysterio the villain?
so mysterio uses illusions
to fight spiderman
a rahu is that which has the ability to
create illusion
illusion what is why media do good
for strong
maya
yah. i mean it's related to our work.
it is absolutely and digital they say
completely related to rahu. but i feel
you know what all these things are in even reiki.
sorry i'm going back to but we have seven
bodies. so one is our actual body than the
the seventh layer of the body is the astronomer
astronomical body. so thats
yes astral body. so that's connected to the
planets.
hmm.
so somewhere the planets' positions end
everything impacts you.
you know.
like it's a science.
or i know you know i just love astrology
and understanding deeply. of the show
it's a very deep subject isn't it? it's not
something one should just discount saying that
this can't have any impact.
because milliers don't believe in
astrology but believers do.
that's right.
your community end
but you know the surprising thing is in me
house i believe in astrology the most.
compared to my parents and all my dad is
like son, beyond all this there is god. so
don't worry too much. and i'm like, i know
that. and i agree with him that astrology
works up to a point. you know because
that's when you're born. but even after
that you have your karma na
ok ok someone has one chat later
that person is a horrible person so that will
also affect it or then if a person
is a lovely human being that will also
affect it
i'm a big christopher nollen fan
you like christoph
or a great person to be a fan of
i talked about nolan because
there is a lot in his batman series.
is a famous dialogue
that when it comes to ethics it's
not about who you're underneath but it's a
actions that define you.
absolutely
whatever you said, you can say to the world
that i am a good person. but you come here
you have to define what you do.
or and even if you see if we read geeta
are. i have read many versions of the gita
and understanding lord krishna is not
that's easy because sometime you feel like why
who makes this decision? like why would he
from this is right? either this is right or this is wrong
is. but their one concept of religion,
he always puts her first. so i came
think again right and wrong also is a very
very deep analysis isn't it?
like we have complex in this entire episode
talked about media world.
and here you are talking about bhagwat geeta.
yes. i love reading the geeta. i again and again
i read geeta. because every time i
i read, i learn something new.
for example what happened?
the biggest lesson for me is, do your work and get the result.
don't worry about. that's the biggest
biggest lesson because it's not in yours
hands. you can only do your best with a
good intentions with a clean heart and just
give your best work hard. i believe a lot
in hard work you must settle or you have to.
you know so work hard. keep your heart clean work
keep doing it. whatever happens will be good and nothing else
even if it happens, people have so much goodwill for you.
or
and that's something i started to realize
very recently that's right now my
image and my personality especially in my
industry which is telugu mostly has gone
beyond my films in terms of weather
is the film done well or not well it's gone beyond
that's my goodwill
you know which slowly everybody is talking
about everybody is seeing including the
audience so i think eventually that's yours
it's earning, isn't it? your goodwill is your earning.
that is, with you on your death bed.
there will be no money. but those people's blessings
will happen.
absolutely i completely agree with you.
there will be no money.
or there won't be even a maximum of people, you know, a little
बहुत जो भाव होंगे और इस फिनोबे डायों इस
there you know that i lived my life well
lived. i have never harmed anyone. i have done
my best. so
you are a very interesting person.
or
thank you.
i think so because my thoughts keep me
occupy a lot. so it will be interesting, right?
maybe.
i'm wondering what your red flag is?
there is a lot. you're meant to tell you. my raid
flag is possessiveness.
oh nice.
the athlete was i don't know i may be that
one more lesson in life for me. something that
i'm working on working on my inner
child. like i told you. inner child is
actually very very interesting to work
on and very important. i don't know
why i'm working on it so late in my
life.
has attachment style.
my
it is not asian. my expectation
probably the attachment style. don't know.
you expect a lot from your partner.
from.
i think or i think my expectations
it's a little too much.
are you a clingy partner?
no.
you are chill.
i am chill. my butt gets so much that
again that right and wrong thing. you know that
you give what you get. meaning i do this
so obviously the other person will do
it or if it's not right for me
why would that person do it? you know i came
think it's not tasty and clingy it's
more of how i say it's more of moral
if that makes sense
hmm or
hmm i'm curious.
you don't have to tame not asking on the
names.
i won't tell any names.
the best relationship you have had so far
my first one
school in school
really
i think that was my best relationship
most green flag guy that i've had
dated was in my school
he is married
not he is my neighbor now but he is like
my brother now so that's not
transformation that's not
butt says that even in marriage there is a point
after that your partner uses the energy of each sibling.
becomes like
but i actually agree with you, right?
this happens because you become more like
best friends, bodies
isn't it? or and you become so comfortable.
but why wouldn't you go on a date with
your neighbor
because he doesn't ask you out.
he comes up and says that he is nidhi, let's
just explore it from very adult
perspective now as in like let's
explore from a very mature perspective
now.
and right now i don't think i would be
able to connect with him.
because you are a different person. because i felt
like me who is mentally, emotionally,
the eq we're talking about, it's
really changed a lot for me to connect with
99% off
because of life?
yes, that means life has taught me so much, so much.
is beaten.
is beaten.
this much has been given.
has given and beaten. both together.
together, together. gave it by beating. u
no
every young person does not want fame
without understanding this.
the experience of fame is very good. butt
you will be beaten a lot.
too much. and you know something recently
itself i was thinking about this.
sometimes i think about this that i have done so much
why did i choose a difficult career? i i i
don't regret it. okay, because i love my
job. but by my job, i mean i love going
to set, i love acting, i love talking to
my director.
five stars as a gift and i love that. that
this is my job. but the other parts of me
job. i don't love that. like i don't love the a
judgment. i don't love the games. i don't love the
politics. but unfortunately it's all a
part of the same game. and somewhere i'm not
made for that game. i'm realizing that
more at time. but you know the most
interesting thing that was i opener for
m. because i work with prabhas now and then
is exactly like this. child life
no games
no politics no fakeness none of that and so
i used to always think that i would ever
make it big because of being this soft
being this sweet and nice and knowing it's okay
great or ok done being like that how will
i make it very big but after i met him
and worked with him is when i realized
he is even more child like than me he is
even more soft and sweet and genuine
and all of that then me and if he could be
today india's biggest superstar i feel
is so if only can be that then may be being
like that's better na
like the reasons of valuing what you are
saying is i know this from talking till now
it turns out that your perspective is very correct.
accurate, you are very observant
too much. so
i feel no. it's like i meet
someone and for some reason i feel like i can
feel late core. like i can just feel it.
what is the core of prabhas?
pure.
purity
which means a white heart emoji?
a very very very he is a lovely human
being. meaning he is an actor. once you meet him.
you'll forget the fact that it's an act.
you'll forget the fact that he's been
working in this industry for the last 20
25 years on, he isn't like that. he is not
a commercial cow. he is not he doesn't have
like pr teams. he doesn't have you all
this politics that goes on. he is very
simple. and he is so it's like meeting
like a five year old
baby. you know meeting him. meaning intentions
they are equally pure. and he so
excited about films, film making.
so, i have like new found respect for
snow. after working with him. the nicest
person i've met in my life not in the
industry in life
that's him
i remember after baahubali maine na maine
discover through telugu cinema baahubali
do it
or beans
and i speak for many other indians
g beans
or
i started reading up about prabhas
and i came to know that one of his 20 years
had a long career and then became baahubali.
his life
or
and here we are, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years later
started crying about his career. are you tired?
got jaded.
but it took them 20 years to get a baahubali.
absolutely.
and now we're having the conversation
about.
or he himself has been in the journey for 20 years.
kept his heart clean.
kept the heart clean. absolutely. and baahubali
even before there were five years of shooting
just for that movie. physically very very
very taxing. and i think not doing any
other films. and meaning what people see is one
thing. but the internal journey is also an actor
is a whole other story. only when you talk
to them you will understand what they go
through at that point of time. and the biggest
the thing is when baahubali releases the first day,
there was flop talk.
they were like it's a disaster.
why?
it took people a while for them to accept the
film to understand it and to celebrate
it. like the way they did. butt on the first day
judgment was a disaster. so imagine that in 5 years
sacrificing after work
everything's waking up the next morning
and seeing that's okay it's all gone for a
west. and then it picks up. so just
imagine the roller coaster for that person
mentally.
you know does 48 hours or does four days. its
it's a roller coaster right?
do you think he is also
detached from the results?
i think he is very detached from the
results and i'm slowly seeing that's his
that's the right way. you know because he does his
job. he gives his best.
i feel this is what career anxiety feels like.
neither to everyone. soon i felt it a lot. all
off us feel. the only way to handle that is the
core geeta lesson.
yes.
just give your efforts 100% don't care
about.
that's it. because there is no time for everything
is. and i've realized this when it's the
right time you don't do anything and
everything works out for you. but when it
this is the wrong time ranbir. you can get heaven
and earth together and nothing will work out.
yah.
it's time.
you know and even in saying that even in the
wrong time when you give even more
effort. yah.
it's i agree with you. meaning result it
doesn't have to come in. will come somewhere
result but nothing goes for waste. good end
bad.
bringing a little philosophy into this
please do.
a you know there's this quote that goes were not
human beings having a spiritual
experiences but spiritual beings having
a human experience.
interesting.
when
yah.
on a human level. i know this thing about
just putting in efforts and not thinking
about the results.
very tough.
it can be tough to sustain. then you have to
turn philosophy.
hmm.
and then that gets you through. that's just no
that's your temporary. like i have so
many spiritual people were on the show.
they say things like everyone thinks that
at the point of death you walk into heaven
go and then there is an astral world
it happens. but another look at the same moment
the view is that at the moment of death, you
it turns out that well that human
it was an experience, it was a dream. hmm.
this is the reality.
or. true. and the thing is we will never know
dec. isn't it? we will never get the answers to this thing
will not meet. you know when i was younger
when i was like i think my saturn
my period came in my childhood itself.
saturn mahadasha?
yes, it came in my childhood itself. so, at that
that's the point where i became a vegetarian.
i used to be a non-vegi. randomly like
hey 8 old kid just deciding to become
vegetarian. also that has something to do with
dalai lama. but i'll tell you that day.
so, his sister used to live in my old
building. wow!
the llama assistant, she uses to give me a
chocolate avery. that orange candy, with the
transparent wrapper. every day, like all the
kids are used to playing and she is used to calling
me and she's to give me that every single
day. and in that period, i think a lot of
things happen in my life. i suddenly
started to become very mature, in my
thinking. ah i was thinking like a 30 year old
old, at the age of eight. you know, i started
having exist, existential crisis
questions, like, what's the point of
if i live one day, i can die. what
is the point? you know i mean for an 8 old
kid to think that's not really normal
that's turning vegetarian a lot of things
so what was i talking about i
completely went off track saturn
saturn so because that came in my childhood
i think this whole thought process way
of life accepting hard work
accepting this kind of concept
started very-very early on in my
life. so saturn, number at all of these
things have really
toot me.
is it your birthday?
august 17th
we
wow they look like a lot of saturn.
a lot
are you bogged down by it?
no i think saturn has taught me the most
important and most beautiful lessons
very early on in my life. where i
didn't have to wait for my 30s and 40s
learn them. and at a very very young age i
saw the reality of people. the just reality. u
know how people behave when you have a good
friday. how people behave when you have a bad
friday? so i think i've seen all of
that now?
would you like to be born again?
i won't want to be born again? no.
no, i'm i'm trying my best to make
this my last life. if what we learn is
hindu kids.
yah. which i think it is.
i also feel it is somewhere. i feel you can
attain moksha nirvana whatever it is. i
think you can and actually may not. i
used to be very-very scared of death.
when i was younger. i was like
petrified of it. because that's essential
thing right then what's the point? why m
i'm working so hard. why am i here?
why am i ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai
talking to anybody? one day i'm going to
be gone then what?
what will happen after that?
you know veer speaking about raji nandi. so
have done so many episodes of. it always
feels like reading a new book.
yah.
because he got that kind of knowledge and he
analyze something.
great. i've seen your podcast with him
and that man has something special in him.
he mentioned the word in one of the first
episode it's related to what we are
talking about. i think the word is mumutsu
if i am not mistaken. mumukshu and mumutsu
mumukshu.
it basically means a soul that gets so
tired of all these material games or that's it
cry out to the divine saying that please
just take me away from this whole material
world or
and that's when your real fierce
spiritual journey starts
hmm so i think fame riches everything is
just to push you to that point of becoming
a moment
probably because
like it there is no money and no fame
actually feel
nice
or i think after a point that's what
happens right like it's like when a person
ain't may be rich they want to earn they know
the importance of money you want to earn
earn earn but after a certain point how much
ever money you've posted that one mark of money
it doesn't matter
because your lifestyle is the same as yours
expenses everything is the same
thing with fame i think
i have something very weird to tell you.
is it related to i'm sorry i'm interested
that's ok
sorry and i'm not talking to you like a
woman i'm just talking to as a spiritual
being you
or
but in your life as a woman it's okay
especially a famous woman
who looks the way you do
i'm sure you've met a lot of guys
get attention and lots of them
billionaires are boys
ok
why don't you suck them on a
spiritual
i think
so first of all i'll just give you a little
the context that i have in my mind
i have always been a heroine. which is why
seriously i also came to my school
was always a heroine in my head. which is
why i think my behavior is my thought
process about myself has never changed
oh now i am good. in my head i was always
good. if you see it good. if you don't see it
your loss. i've always had that kind of a
what is thinking about yourself?
whatever. butt or whatever it is. so i have
always think that and always get attention from boys
i think got it. and
i felt that there was one thing for sure
don't like. she showed off. i think thats
the first thing that puts me off but going
yes i cant i really cant
handle you know people who show off because i don't
know it doesn't sit well with me. i feel like
just have gratitude. you got lucky. we all got
lucky.
what is attractive personality trade?
is it?
sincerity
authenticity
authenticity sincerity i wood in boys
say for me it would be stability and
dependability
i think that's something that would really happen
attract me to a person and a good hearted
human wood instantly attract me you know
so
actually what is the deepest love?
basically means you'll need to live with that
person in the same room for 100 years of
alpha
or so it's about the silence it's about
being kam and i always think with
your partner is someone you need to be able
to make life decisions with
like from the smallest to the biggest of
from a decision of where to live to a
ventilator decision meaning from smallest to
the biggest decision with that one person you have
to make so you are able to decide anything
with that person you know is it possible to talk
to this person is it possible for this person
to understand things from your
perspective as well that i feel is
very variant
can i tell you a very random tag but it's
related to human relationships
ok
this is how you ask mother goddess
i actually
shivji
shivji very much and hanumanji very much
more meaning hanuman ji is my i love
hanuman ji
show your wallpaper then
yes you can just show
outside is hanuman ji this has been my wallpaper
for like 15 years
wow
i haven't even changed the colors photo nothing
it's look to your left.
o
hanuman ji is right here but you know i will
tell you one more story about hanuman ji and
inside is shivji
oh wow
so
poetic
isn't it poetic
but hanuman ji i think before i get on
any stage i always say jai hanuman in my
mind before i get on any place where i go
am a bit nervous i just said jai hanuman and
i am good hanuman chalisa is always with me
because i'm very petrified of like
ghosts that's i think my biggest
fear in life is what if i hear something
and what if i see something you know i would to
get a heart attack i can't handle it.
so hanuman chalisa is always with me. from i
the hanuman chalisa everyday. i go to the
hanuman temple very offen and i love hanuman
yes. i think hanuman ji is really literal
saved me in so many situations.
even as an adult a successful adult.
yes a 100%
peacock. or. and some how every film that came
am doing has some connection with hanuman ji.
or like the last director i've worked with
with his name is maruti.
hm
there is some connection always with hanuman ji
with every film that i do. i i don't
what that is.
hmm hmm. hmm.
feel it saved you.
i feel it saved me. or hanuman ji is
really saved.
i think i'd have been swimming in a pool
of drugs and sadness if i didn't have
my religion. hmm. i can completely
emphasize with that. yah, yah.
with how crazy our industry is and you
see so many drug infused stories and
absolutely.
infidelity and all these things.
feel religion is that anchor call it. it is no,
it is, you know, what religion is not a bad
word. i feel like people just take it in a.
or is it because of different contexts?
in the west, religion is like a battle.
like modernism versus ancient thoughts.
the thing is how do you explain what we
feel it's a sanat. we look at as a philosophy.
yah.
now, the world calls hinduism, sanatan
dharma, a religion, and they club it with what
the context of the world religion is in the
west?
or, but my question is, what is the
problem with sanatan dharma? it a it talks
about having a healthy lifestyle, eating
satvik food, doing certain practices,
that's only good for you, so, physically,
mentally, emotionally, it's good for you. so,
what's the problem with that? the thing is i
think when you're following it a and when
you educate yourself with human intent as
a subject that just be a kind person to
avery
or we see it is a philosophy but the fact that
we're discussing it makes it a religious
oriented conversation you know and then lots
off people switch off to it which is fine
their souls are not supposed to find these
conses
i think so it's eventually that's their journey
it's just a different kind of journey there
soul journey i'm talking about ya
i've told you that dark things
dark thing please
ok so
i met a relative recently he's a very
good high level doctor in the us he said that
give a new field of medicine which is a
very ethically important field ok but you
need to listen
about it from a slightly mature
perspective
it's called euthanology
okay okay so there's a word called
euthanasia what is its kind of
related to euthanology but it's not
euthanology. so euthanasia is when
an animal is very unknown and you know you can't
save the animal
then you will put it to see like a dog and a
cap.
but the same rules apply to human beings.
if they cannot be saved if there's in that
vegetable state sometimes they give
euthanasia to just be kinder with them.
ok
okay so that's what euthanasia is.
that's why the word comes to
know here what uthnology so up till
very recently may be pre covid the world
treated older people in this manner so if you
fall ill as an older person you go to a
hospital
save you got some very big illness pneumonia
you will be given medicines to save you but
then when you recover you're living a lower
quality of life and you probably living
with suffering your lungs have got damaged all the
and then each disease is you in its own
they are at that age if you are 90 years old
95
euthanology is a specialized branch of
medicine where doctors are trending to take
away from the suffering from an old person when
they are highly revealed
so if you got pneumonia go to a
euthanologist they will give you medicines to
reduce your pain to make it easier to make
it more gentle
hmm
but they don't give you the medicines too fully
save your life ok. so don't treat it,
they just reduce your pain basically.
to take away your journey.
take away the suffering. ok.
ok. and this is becoming a very common thing
in the west.
but it is very difficult for indian families
presently to understand and accept this.
or, or.
because everyone lives with their grand
parents.
ah, and grandparents also usually
two types. but they're mostly of the second
time. the first is the once, i want to
hold on to family life, etcetra. butt
when you become old enough but once you hit a
certain age and you're suffering that much just
because of old age
or lots of people want to move into the
the next phase of their soul's journey.
right!
ok which is what indian culture tells you
about etcetra.
so it's a very difficult topic to
explain ethnology
two indian families.
or but there's a new age protocol which
that's the second generation. so, if people are age
have grandparents, are parents generation
who are like 50, 60, 70, now, need to have a
family meeting and figure if they want to
apply an ethnologist in their own family.
exactly, i think that would be the best
possible way to do that.
but it becomes a new age issue and everyone
our age, the dark reality that we will have
to do this for our parents also at some
point.
oh my god, i can't even imagine. yah.
that was the dark ya.
angle. or
ah i don't remember how we reached uthnology
but it's something that i was thinking about
from a very like ethical perspective
because some people will look at this as unethical
things they look at like murder but it's
not |
or i mean i don't think it's i think
its
i mean these are all very very subjective
you know things to know that every person has a it's like
god and love you know there's no one right or
wrong thing it's just everyone's different
definition or a different expectation of it
but i feel it's not wrong. i feel if you
how like a meeting with your family and the
person decides how they would want to
eventually and their life i think it's in
a way better.
or i think you know the reason that meeting is
required because of different personalities
react differently to the concept of death.
or. like you'll have some uncle on aunt who is
very sensitive to death. give immediate look
at this age a painful subject. true.
and another person who looks like death is
just the next stage.
as a part of life.
as a part of life.
ironically. yah.
or. ahh
i remember how we chowed it. we ched up buzz
we were talking about selecting a life
partner.
hum-hmm and especially for people in our age
group?
or.
ah are life spans are probably going to be
longer than normal.
you're selecting someone for the next 120
years of your life.
120 years? oh green has 120 years of life.
i mean id. great.
if longe it really takes out.
or. ah but ya like and you need to select
a partner based on the possibility of
hardcore conversation like ethnology.
or i mean first of all selecting a
partner is the most important decision of
your life because that one decision will make others
you are and break you. you know it will give you a
life full of happiness or a life full of
loneliness. may be i don't know. but and also
it's the only decision
full of loneliness. it could you know and also
think about it ranveer it's the only decision
that makes you don't choose your parents i
mean i be in some where you do but to ours
mind you know you don't choose your parents you
don't choose your kids you have to choose just
that one person that you have to make right
choice we let's go back to your green
flags end
you are single now
yes be single
single
but very ready for marriage if the right person
comes
or i think or i see myself married
like we have discussed and may be i need a
little bit of time may be a couple of months
i would also like to get to know the person
who i'm going to get married to so that also
would take some time you know like
what is the test
tastes are fine, it was in a barfi, right?
taste wether the lampshade falls and you know she
if you don't move then my tests would be of that type.
it's like you know if you're like
crossing the road and the other person is just
not not bothered about you.
it's the smallest things. have you seen this?
one video of like an old couple. the lady is
bending down and the old man is sitting
and he just puts his hand there so that she
doesn't hit her head on the table.
i think my tastes are very like that because
it's the micro moments in life you know
that really tells you a person's character and
weather that person will be there for you or not.
because in good times when you're young and
everything is great. but you know you
are gonna get older. you're going to need help
at some point of time. your partner is
going to see you in the most ugly situations
faces faces possible. so or it has to go
beyond physicality and beyond
or. like society and work and level and
success and status. it has to go beyond
all of that. or
i think when you are marrying someone, right?
you are marrying the energy of their heart.
and from their potential, from their family
from their karma
everything you know you are literally because of you
you're going to have kids with that person and
you're literally gonna merge your souls together
so you have to be mean we touch a dirty thing
don't clean your butt, you don't know how clean
and dirty somebody's soul is, there's past,
their intentions are.
how to find out immediately?
i think by little things i mean these are true
big things but it's not even the
small things it's the micro things. u
no the micro expressions, the micro
intentions, the micro reactions. i think
it's that and a lot of it is to do
with the person's parents. hmm!
because i really believe that you're a sum of
your parents in a way. i mean i see that
with myself as well and with most people
around me. so i would really want to choose
someone who has brought up their child really
well. that's very very important.
you know the court that goes. is a coat i
really love.
it's a court about marriage. it goes that
marriage is a life long process of healing
each others. wounded in our child. but its
life long.
that's actually true.
and the stuff that got wounded in childhood
will heal in the late stages of you. when you
60 70
or.
signing up for at 30 years.
or so choose a less wounded child. wounded
in child.
i don't like i think everyone's wounded.
or. i agree with you. i mean even people
had the most beautiful childhoods and
raising has wounds. you know the thing is
i based on what i have noticed beautiful
childhoods and upbringings of can
won't you in your 20s and 30s
or so everyone gets wondered you know the harsh
the truth is that your own life's victories are
kind of happening because it's big
complexes you carry
i actually agree with that as well somewhere
the validation you know you need validation from
so many people may be
ego required to keep going but egos
coming from the wolves
yah. it is, it absolutely is.
ah loosely based on what's red and
learn. i feel like the
praveen i am surprised. like you are
really
i talk to subjects everyday.
or. but you really really got this to the t.
yes, when you said this last thing
of it's the woods that actually make you may
b. ambitious. a lot of positive things
that come in your life are somewhere also because
of this.
yah. you know, like what's driven at the
end of the.
or, like, why emission? why?
it's a chase to fill up om.
or.
what's your om?
why you? push so hard.
am i think with me it's not about
validation. it's really not about that. i
feel i think it would just come down to love
with me. i want love.
or. i feel like i may be i need to give
love myself a little bit more. which is what
i've figured out with the last few months
of self work that i've been doing. i
really need to give my self love. not the
vanity care that i do. i do take good
care of myself but i mean self love.
unconditional self love.
you know my mom is a gynecologist and i
was talking to her about what pregnancy
feels like a mom as she
understood pregnancy. she says that's there
r to things. one, any doctor of any
kind has experienced the divine at play
in their work. if you work for like 20-30
years, you know that there are some miracles that
happen.
yah.
ah and child birth is one of two biggest
miracles. the second thing she said is when
there is an embryo in your womb it could
even be with a surrogate mother.
ah the embryo releases stem cells into the
woman's blood stream and hills the women
and parts that she doesn't know about.
physically and emotionally.
so nice. so, pregnancy shifts a lot
specially for the momma. for the dad, it's
like a lot of responsibility and all.
or. but it's biological for the mom.
i had i didn't know about this
interesting. so it's you and veg.
or probably on a deeper level than just
biological.
or or. energetic level, soul level.
i was just so i just headed this
conversation like 12 hours ago. so, that's
it's fresh.
but how lovely? because usually you think of
pregnancy is something that is very difficult
for the mother right? like physically because of the
hormonal changes and everything. but this is
a beautiful way to look at that. just
asking you as a woman.
do you look forward to
being pregnant?
yes. i do. because i'm clear that i
want to have kids.
how if i think of it, i think i would
wanted to be through me. i mean it's great
that people are doing other procedures,
ivfs and that whole think i'm not very
sure on the terms but i think that's
amazing as well but i think i would want to
have it the
like me i know it will be a journey but you know
the like as a sheath when you are born in a
male body it's very hard to amplify
how is it ranveer tell me
to be born in a male body or fantastic
how it's fantastic actually great
the more you get to learn about girls' bodies
the more you figure that thank god
like it's girls' bodies are complex.
they are complex. it's like a cocktail.
someone was telling me a guy's body is like a
neat drink. girls body is like a
cocktail. you know it has a lot of hormones
and a lot of these things. i think a guy
the emotional body is way more messed up then.
ok. interesting.
or that's that's there for sure. because i
i think a girl's biological body has given
ability to give life.
ok. so that's why it's a more
complex system.
right? but for whatever reason girls are able
to emotionally regulate they better than men
but like for example its early 30s
man i spoken i know you know kl rahul
from bored i keep talking about this
that age you turn 30 as a guy and he is a
sports person
yes you become very conscious of your body
degrading
we and that affects you emotionally it
starts happening at like 28 29 end
then at 30 31 some switch happens. this is
why athletes kind of start trailing
off.
hmm.
so i ask him how you're dealing with this
whole thing? he is like it's there but some
it's something to handle psychologically.
psychologically.
and he is one of the best faces of career
right now.
yah, weiss.
love kl.
yah. we do is lovely.
i want to talk about a little bit to you.
because it's i've seen him. i seen both off
you mentioned each other interview way back.
yah.
you know each other before fame.
yah. so, i came exactly. i have non him
before becoming a cricketer. he's not me
before i became an actor from bangalore. income
mean we want like really good friends, but
we knew each other and then we happened to meet in
bombay. and it was just nice to see a
familiar face. it was nice to know that okay,
fine. i know someone here, who is known me
from before, who doesn't just know this version
of me, but they, they know that has always been
like this and i'm trying to figure my
way out. and i'm sure it was the same for
snow.
and i'm so proud of him. i thought only
is it really very very difficult to make
it. you know, both of your very poisoned people.
be it bangalore, it's bangalore energy.
i don't know. rahul dravid energy. a male name.
this in bangalore everyone loves rahul
dravid. rahul dravid is like loved by
everyone.
nikhil kamat same category.
nikhil kamat.
or and i think bangalore people just have
dec. little bit of a chilled out energy.
where they were ambitious. but they are not
desperate in any way. i think. or. it that
just comes across. or. back to something intense
topic we speaking
mail like after the age of 30 you know you
start to
that's what the trials of having a mail are
bodies are like what i had i didn't know
that
andrologist on the show
a guy has a really tough time in the old age
like there are two three issues that come up
is it hormonal?
or is it hormones prostate
and you know when you're a teenager ah your
hormones are through the roof and your body is
like a muscle building machine
or recovery is this speak? yah.
you are able to digest food and put on the
muscle strength very quickly.
and you see a degradation of that in your
early 30s it's the reverse.
so mentally it's difficult to accept.
yah, it's a very deep form of humbling
that happens.
like you start really shifting yours
perspective. and parallelly you see your
career becoming easier in your 30s.
so it's it really makes you read aligned
lot of stuff. yah.
but that's the only challenge that i have
encountered in 32 years of biological
life. or girls from the time you get
periods. till the time you have pregnancy
after that. it's always like someone. yaah,
menopause.
something or the other. i feel like with
women, i actually feel like, you're at
your peek from like 28, 29 i feel like you
look your best, you feel your best, your
decisions are very much better than what they give
used to be. you feel emotionally much more
stronger. you come into your own as a person.
i feel by 28 and somewhere you're not
scared.
you know at that age to like pz people offer and
up 'em the wrong way. like you're just like
this is what i feel and this is how i come
think and for me this is what it is. u
start becoming very clear. you know.
every girl i'm just thinking about
pregnancy? egg freezing?
i mean or my mom and i how had
conversation is well. you know about egg
freezing? i think it's a great idea.
it's a great option and you know ranveer
thing is with women. i feel like the
hormones and everything is one thing okay
you can deal with that. but the most
the complicated thing is the age where you are
picking in your career and the age to get
married and have babies is like ah interning.
it's the same age and then you reach a
point. where it's very confusing. you know,
you're like, okay, because it's not like you
can't just have all you need to have the baby. u
need to take care of it and to avoid it
the deeply wounded inner child of your child. u
need to be late for your child. you know it
so important. i mean
highq speaking.
or because the more i'm learning about inner
child. i'm learning about how
important dose first six to eight
years of life are and everything is form
you know within that age. so my mom is me
i've spoken to her in three days
me when i pick up but interesting
timing knows for her to call me now but anyway
so
right
but or that do's first six to eight years
are so important
you see unwanted and highly healed
highly healed i think it would be unwanted i
don't i had lovely but you know i think somewhere
i've always like i told i think this
the whole saturn thing coming in my childhood
has someone made me become very mature at a
very young age so i feel like i've never
been very very child like that very
childish thing has never really been there
am also the oldest siblings so i
have always been very responsible
correct very work is composed
strong
dumpt you
dumped ego
i mean no i've been dumped but i have
been cheated on if that countered as dumpt
indirectly that's dumpt so or i have
been cheated on
was a partner famous
no that was before
before yours
before my god or i got cheated teenager
as a teenager and it was so difficult for
me to understand the concept because i am
like but why
because you're very logical right you're like
if you're with me why would you then
don't be with me? so you can't understand the
concept of it. when you're young. i was
traveling i was not in the country. i was
traveling. so i thought i was in
australia and something for a while and ya.
butt or butt that wasn't like a serious
relationship anyway. so i don't think it
really hurt me or it really was heart
broken. i don't think i've actually been
very heart broken earlier on in mine
life. ah it was like a whatever
relationship. nothing serious.
let me introduce you to the marriage
market. a lot of
oh god.
marwari boys out there.
boys. or, i think so. butt
you've never dated anyone that you're fielding
maring?
not before. may be some time ago or one person
one just one.
but again no actually i haven't.
we have told parents open to arrange
marriage?
i mean they have asked me many times.
i've always been saying that's okay we will
c will c give me some time. give me another
year, give me another year. so i have been
taking one-one year. because
i don't know. i just feel like it marriage is
something that just needs to happen. you know, you
just need to meet someone and feel like, okay,
i think this person would have a great life
partner. as much as there is love and this ends
that's all and all of that i agree with. but it has
to be like a well made good decision
you know you can't just go with love i feel you
need to decide
we should go to banaras and ask
go to kashi and oh god please please me
bring me a relationship
shivji please send someone like you
ya shivji how beautiful with that
no i see that with a lot of again girls are
age a lot of shivji shiv shakti bhakti
or you know i had this dialogue in one
film also id it was a telugu dialogue
naku ramdul aunty vaadi kawali what means
i want a guy like lord ram
wow wow nice
or so i think somewhere let's be
manifest that you know
we
someone like
you definitely need an indian cow
i you know something for some reason i'm i mean
some you know foreigners they look great and
everything's great but i can't imagine
myself with a foreigner i don't know why
i just think i'm too desi
or that's that one aspect i also feel
that if you're an indian and if you're an
artist
there's too much philosophy already in you
head's highly indian and you need to match that
frequency with another indian
or like i just don't feel it or otherwise
i think i need an indian
you know how would you explain this ramji's
angle to some american
like or like just just know it
it's two layered indian indian dharam and all
dec.
or
what did you like about banaras?
i love the energy late. i thought so i stayed
in this hotel called bridge something's on the
ghats. so i've actually gone there for
shoot. i shot for this film called smart
shankar late. and so oh my god, i didn't
tell you this. so i went to the temple end
that was the first time my mom joined me at
a shoot. so she came for a day. my parents
never come to my shoot ever. i guess they get
board and something. so they never like a company
me or anything but i had called her because
i wanted to do darshan and i just went
and i just prayed and i was like god if
this film doesn't work i'll leave but if i
ment to stay in this industry as an
actor show me a sign with the result of this
film and that film becomes a huge
blockbuster unexpectedly. no one thought
that film would you know become this huge butt
it became a huge blockbuster. i came to sleep
was like ok may be dots my sign to stay
give them. because i was like this is my answer.
if this doesn't work i'm out if this works
will i stay?
do you remember with
temple you go to?
i went to the kashi vishwanath temple. did di
abhishek there in the morning. give less abhishek
from in south. so i did that in the morning.
and that was when also hit my head on
so there was this temple that i had to go
into. when the wall was really low. i came to sleep
just got up and i just hit my head so
badly that there were just like hot tears
coming down. you know i didn't even
react it was just instant but after
that's my entire perspective on life
god spirituality myself completely
changed. you know there's one thing they say
about number at right? so this is number eight.
but they say when you become spiritual it
becomes infinity. so i think that's what
happened to me in kashi
that at just became infinity
you had to go through that pain as a personnel
clance
i think so because that was really painful it
vase stone
and it was right here
it was in ka vishwanath
it was in kashi vishwanath
that's a good thing
or
then i don't feel bad
or is there something bad for you but thank you
fine it's fine
life becomes nice after
life became very very different after that i
think i stopped
so i'm very detached from results in
my life also my ketu time is going on
butt or sleepy ketu
so that's got some great lessons for my age
well a so i have seemingly become very
ditched from
people from results from everything
or i'm just becoming more and more ditched
i think from things
you know because this theme has come up again i am
gonna take away a tangent
that's in my head
or
so in the last two days there was this one
clip that went viral of shubman gill
ok
ok shubman gill is like india's new
cricket superstar
or and he has recently been dropped from one
off our three teams
ok
to the t20 team
hmm now as the media in india sometimes
does it happen in a press conference?
was question about being wrong he man how
do you feel
how will you feel and
his response was so nice.
he repeated the same lesson that we've spoken
about. but sometimes you just need that pop
culture figure to repeat it to remind
yourself.
and message him saying bro loved this.
yah.
ah he said that, ah, hey, i'm giving my
100% all the time, and, i don't know what's what
in my destiny, can't be taken away from.
or, it can't.
and that's why i'm okay with it, because
i am putting in my 100% effort, and i
income income income income income income income income confident in
my own life. very mature and very well
sed
that's my
you know or that's the india captain
absolutely no i agree with what you need
that mind set and i also feel like people
like even the audience everybody needs to
always look at things as a whole you don't look
at today today today today today today is
yesterday tomorrow you know it's not just about
this movie worked, this match was won, it's not
that you see the greatest of the greatest
people who have lived on this planet you know
most famous people who have lived all had
a journey of ups and downs it's not just
up and up and up no one's life is like that
you know so even on top the person is as
talented even at their lowest that same
the person is so talented that talent is nothing
to do with where you are in life. or you know
there's this listen that i think i learned
fairly late as a media professional and
help me out with this because i know you will
get what i'm saying but if i am
articulating it correctly
ah social media engagement has become a bit
of a metric especially in our world age
content how many views how
yaah
but the thing is
now take a step back and when we were
growing up in india in the 90s and 2000s
there were so many superstars. you go on
there social media stuff now they aren't
getting that much engaged.
no they are not.
give me likes 10 to 15 likes. i
also think again even that's an up and down
journey.
yah.
and eventually you will be remembered for
your days of work?
abs.
if being remembered interest us a
concept.
or. again, yah.
like because i have also noticed that
everyone who obsesses over legacy ends up in
sadness.
hm
everyone goes who wants to build legcio. i
see this with athletes, actors, just chill
out and work.
i don't know i feel like now days it's not
possible to build a legacy. i mean i could
b wrong. but everything is so temporary.
it's just news these two days. anything
sticks around for 2 days and end and end
and and and and and then they forget
about it. you know, a person's career whatever
like a movie or a great win is
remembered for like a week. and then it's
dunn.
have you ever had a conversation like this
with pawan kalyan, sir? oh my god pawan kalyan
sir that's why i have to say first all let me
give you some
back story about him he is a phenomenon
right like he is equivalent to god in
andhra and telangana like equivalent two
god's the kind of crazy that he is
unmatched like it's unparalleled and i
realize what i was working with
him so the moment people came to i am
working with him they all were like do well
well, yes, you're working with our god and
everything and i was like, okay, great. i
i will try my best. but this is true
an intelligent man. he is so there is
something about her or ranveer it's it's
very magnetic.
and whatever he does it's the way it sits, the
he he stands, the he he speaks, he he can
do anything, it just feels like for the lack
of a better word mass. you know it just feels
like that. but very intelligent person, very
bold person. and i think he has the curry
to say things that people wouldn't normally
talk about.
he is very bold, honest, open, in
public, which is always dangerous. butt eye
think his fans love him for that. and he is
like beyond box office.
hmm.
hits and flops don't affect his career
et al.
or. so, it's part of the reason i broke
our his name here. yah.
these are all the personalities that we are
byd. they are beyond the box office collection.
like beyond.
it took time and human effort to
absolutely.
absolutely. time, human effort and
also some kind of situation i think that gives
have very openly faced in the public eye wear
people saw their real characters, their real
personality and fell in love with that. let it sleep
have like personality fans.
what's the core reading of pawan kalyan sir?
i think he is like a courageous. hee is hee
is like a lion. like he can stand alone.
and he just has the guts that nobody else
has.
i don't know why i'm saying this. like
but i won't be surprised if he becomes the
pm of our country incidentally.
i won't be surprised otherwise i really want.
like seriously i want because i feel
he is so he has been working in politics
for many many years. it's just that one
now. so his name has come you know to them
front. but he's been working for many
years. he has been building up his team
his system, his party and everything's end
i feel like he is bold, courageous. always
stands for the right.
yah, and the one thing i know about annie
politician is that they enter the game to reach the
top.
or.
so, this but only some people can end. i feel
if you've navigated the film world with
so much news for so long and then had a
successful political. you on prime position
to.
yah, and simultaneously doing both as well.
i mean too pressuring not most
there are sports as well but one of the
most pressuring a career to have,
right politics and films. too much of
pressure, mental pressure.
i wonder what you know hungry look.
or, i feel for him it's a lot about the
peepal. so i have and i have seen this. like
i've seen him talking to you know the rooted
peepal. i've seen him talking to them and
asking them their issues and working on
that. coming up with a change for that. not
just talking them for public, talking too
them for publicity. but coming up with changes
as well.
can ask about rajinikanth s well?
rajinikanth sir or i mean i have not worked
with him. but he is huge. i mean even today
so, whenever you talk about me, a lot of
the numbers will come in, you know more than anything.
even today brings in huge numbers
an opening itself has a huge business because
people of tamil nadu will go for his film
regardless of anything. the film doesn't even
matter. it's just if it happens rajinikanth,
that's all they want.
with him, i know for a fact. because i know
certain things about him from the
spiritual community, and he spends a
lot of time in ashrams, and he goes to the
stuns. their spiritual force inside.
inside of him. yah. yah.
that's what's driving the outward thing
which the world is seeing his material
success. or. i it has to be you know
actually on some level to reach that position i
think somewhere it has to be.
would you ever want that in any lifestyle of
yours? that's the quantum of success?
i mean if anyone it would have to be this.
lifetime?
this lifetime?
or. if it's to be any lifetime it would have
to be this. but after this i knew i wouldn't
want that. i'd really just want to be
happy on a farm somewhere.
not stressing not even knowing off twitter
and instagram and all of that. i'd just
want to be like in a very different zone in
life. but so that's why if it has to be
anyone it has to be this one.
on a farm someone
or.
nice.
happy with lots of animals and lots of
you know yah.
and a nice indian.
and a nice indian paneer
marwari boy.
no one must have to be marwari.
doesn't have to be a wife.
doesn't have to be marwari.
why not?
i mean doesn't matter.
have you dated any non marwari boy?
i have dated only non marwari boys. i
i don't think i've ever dated a marwari
boy.
ok.
or
so where which community have you felt
compatibility?
may be south indian?
oh!
may be because i've been working the most
in the south. but honestly, i don't know.
specific south indian.
no that i don't know. canada voice,
kannadega.
have i dated a kannada singer? i don't think
so. i don't know.
i don't know but see that doesn't matter.
so doesn't have to be a marwari but. this
has to be a good person.
hmm hmm. i'll tell you from where this
questions less. like, i am punjabi.
my dad is also punjabi. my moms
gujarati.
gujarati.
and it's apparently a stereotype that
punjabi guys go really well with gujarati
girls.
oh! so you're going to find yourself a nice
gujarati girl. i think like there is a
reason why dil lahagi kudi gujarati is a
song.
yes.
there's actually a reason because it's very
it's very balanced.
ya ya i think so
like i am punjabi and i love my punjabi
bros but all a little crazy.
little crazes you need balance.
yes. so the gujarati
balance.
and you need someone to show you your place.
we always
gujarati vimana strong.
yah.
so always.
true.
so there four i throw the ball at you. for me,
i don't think that matters. for me its
just indian is good enough.
indian.
indian.
that's it. ok.
not very typical indian.
where else have you traveled to in india.
oh my god. so i've gone all around
andhra pradesh and telangana for store
openings. and for events like literally the
interior most interior places i've been
bean to. all for what?
any temples that it stayed with you?
temple i remember going to ujjain. i
think that was lovely there is a kaal bhairava
temple also there i went there that was
lovely offcourse tirupati
so many kashi are there and the madurai are there
is a temple meenakshi temple so many
temples
we
or and there's actually one really small
temple in bore it's called the energy temple
it's supposed to balance out all your chakras
light |
i don't know what it's called
unfortunately i i will send you the
message later so you can put the name there but
it's sappho to balance your chakras out so
i love going there it's very far away from
my house but i still go there
is it kind of near the airport
old airport it's near the old airport
not the new one same probably i don't
not many people know i'm surprised
this tower the astle tower
i think how do you know about this
hardly anyone knows about this
because you know i don't the thing is it so
secret and so powerful that i almost
don't want to talk about it on the show oh! i
didn't know that but it's that's a very
powerful temple. yah.
it's called mansai light foundation.
now there's a book called doves to light.
by someone called guruji krishnananda.
ok.
all i can say is this is one of the most
powerful yet unknown spots in india.
it is, or.
and i'm very hesitant about even
mentioning it on the show. but if it's entered
this conversation, i guess it wants.
but it is a beautiful temple.
because it balances your own chakras out.
you know, i mean. are you getting board of this
conversation?
no, are you?
no.
because i'm not.
this is like dude i woke up with a lot of
positivity today for whatever.
i'm glad. i'm glad.
and my moment of waking up dictates a
lot of the day for me.
here same here. i mean for me so age soon
s income income income income income income income income income wake up
for 20 minutes, i like no one talked to me.
i need that time. you know, because then if
something happens, then my whole day is.
i don't think this is ego speaking.
because i've truly submitted even this show
to the divine.
so i feel like anyone brought to this show is
brot for a reason. and then i'm just
doing a duty.
i think so i think the timing is also
right. may be a so i think the last four
months of my life have been very very
weird. you know for me. lots of ups,
lots of down. it's been crazy the last
four months. so it's it's nice to have like a
positive divine conversation with the
i am really a spiritual being.
having a human journey
or i feel it's lovely because summer came
feel like you understand what i am
talking about you know
you look for a spiritual tribe material
plane
and i'm surprised and really happy too
be talking to someone like that because half the
times i feel people don't get it | give just
feel like oh nidhi is always in a
different zone because someone ask me this
question my trainer i think he was like
so which city would you like to live in? and
i was like let me make this a happy
place to live in and then anywhere i afraid
live doesn't matter you know so you need dose
kind of people to interact with right in
life or.
can you talk about the last four months?
oh my god. should i. ok. why not?
whatever you are comfortable with?
or so the last four five months have been
like a lot of highs in terms of work. butt
a lot of loss in terms of my personal
life. you know so the highs have been great. the
lose have also been and it's all like
happening together.
and navigating a successful career.
yah. so it's just been like
confusing in a way you don't know what to do
feel. but i think everything is divine
timing a divine reason. and once yours
karmic balance with someone is closed it's
it's done.
or people visit your life for a limited
amount of time. that's predetermined.
i think so i also teach you something great
lessons.
or
you know
or learn any nice lesson?
oh my god. so many lessons. i think the
the biggest lesson i've learned in the
last couple of years is that the only person
who's gonna be there for yourself is you. u
no so you've got to make your mind yours
emotional space a good space to be in because
literally the only person i'm gonna be late
for you is you
you broke up
ranveer
oh my god i know it wasn't like that
i think it was much more complicated than
that it was more of a situation not a
situationship it was more of a i don't know
what that means exactly situation i
have been trying to wrap my head around it
hanging out with the j bach butt
what is a situation j
get it it seems like an open relationship too
m
it's it's not open relationship like you
are in relationship also but you are not
fully fully committed
that is an open relationship na.
but you're not looking for others too
you just know
and why you're not committed
you're not giving it a tag of like
beyond beyond my understanding
butt or situations i think
ok we were talking about situation ship here
or
this was a relationship
this was a relationship
mutually parted ways because this was not
the father of your children
no this wasn't ya
that's a very that's a very millennial
two millennial college
even for guys you're looking for a girl
could be the mother of children and
eventually it is that i think it's a very
primal thought thought, right?
at the stage of life where career is like
establish now you're looking for a
life. there is so much more life than that
building a career.
100% yes. i mean this is how i look
at my work. or i love my work but it's
my job. you know that job is not my life.
life is beyond data. i need to be
happy fulfilled. i need to have a life
beyond my work.
what's your green flags? s a partner.
my green flags. i think it would be
understanding loving. softness.
softening is to nourishing.
i told you know that motherly. so now i want
someone who takes care of me. that would be
great.
i think every human wants someone to take
care of them.
i think so
i used to think it's every man want
someone wants a girl will take care. butt
girls wanted to.
or. so i think all of that and at some level
i think very like what's the right way to
from dec. not helping but very like
united in a ware
things always become about us more than you
and me. so i would do so much for the other
person as i wood for myself.
do want an ambitious man?
not very ambitious. no
no matter draw the line.
or should you know that this is work and life is
more important.
not not very ambitious. no, like
ambitious. may be i would want a hard
working man, but not a very like only
ambition, no.
have you dated that? only ambition?
hmm no.
ok.
no, ya.
because you hear a lot of women saying
attracted to ambition. but there is a
flipside to ambition.
i think there is.
which is damage from childhood, which is
like lots of time given to work, which
is obsession with work. and i feel like
somewhere people like that like ambition is a
great thing. so i'm a very ambitious
person but i'm a very satisfied
abusive person. it's a very
contradictory thing i noticed or anticipated
but ambitious. so i'm not like dying for
something. it's great if it comes. i will
put in my best but i'm not good.
i know this is all temporary. one day it will
be gone. they will be like who is nidhi. which
it's fine. great.
like this is
no problem.
swayambar of the fund.
i thought so. isn't it? it's becoming like
that. do you mind?
not really it's okay if not now then
when right so why not but what was i
saying yah. so united
one thing i can tell you based on me getting
to know over the course of this episode is that
you need someone i think you need someone outside
off media.
i agree with you.
i agree with you. i mean there are some great
people even you know in our industry. butt eye
feel like the amount of
dependability that i would require from
my partner would be more.
or or late
there's a joy in not having any element of
fame around once life and not being into it
concept of fame. seen this in few people.
and they are some of the happiest people i know.
or. you know i mean i meet some people okay. give
are so excited about going out on a
friday night. give so excited about
watching like a film and traveling someway
and i'm like this is nice.
you know this is nice actually it's a
good change from even my own mind.
yah.
yah.
because i think chase for fame dictates a lot
off another decision.
a lot.
yah.
so that factor isn't there in the first place.
true.
ah as long as one isn't being obsessive
about money. but just knowing we can manage it. well
and kind of earning it. yah.
that's the sweet spot. according to me
based on all the people have met.
or. and even for me like in terms of money
i feel like for me money is something that i
have a very healthy relationship with a may b
because my name is nidhi. so the name is money.
money and money. no but i think i have a
very healthy relationship with money where i am
i don't know. i'm good with it. i am
not obsessive but i love it. but at the same
time like i'm good. like i don't think
too much about it. and even in terms of my
future i don't think that would be like a
very big factor that i am looking for.
you know how usually people do for me it's
not that important.
hmm do you like expensive gifts?
i like to see i like to be not
really. i like to be in a place where if
i like something i should be able to buy it.
i don't have to think about how much it
cost. and i don't need to plan that
okay can i buy this. i don't want to be
in that space. as long as i'm not in that
space i'm good. then i see it doesn't matter
how much it is. you know and that would come from
my income. so i'm not like looking for
someone to be dependent on that person. that
something that i'm very scared of. which
is also a part of the reason why i think
i'm independent because i don't want
to depend on anyone. for anything.

we
not like a family but they step in and
kind dissect the relationship

very involved family is great but they should
be good people

visualizing lots of man.
yes nidhi agarwal. dm on you right now. oh
god, my dems are going to be now of the
marriage relationships.
i'm not even kidding. happened on this show
earlier.
are you serious?
this is a swayamvar theme show.
oh great. so as this i never expected
this ranveer. i thought we'd be talking about
like more of spirituality but we went
into marriage.
ya ya see like my main tg is women's hour
mom's age.
so any actor who is on the show.
who is saying open them marriage. i feel the
parents get very happy with me.
obviously obviously. no but even my dad
sometimes like son now you should think about
it and i'm like ya. a little more time.
i have noticed this in my bros mice. a
are you married? it adds like some other level of
stability to guys like. and i think it
aids that same kind of stability to.
100% yes, it does because there is no option of
okay, i don't like this.
it's not that is to leave and somewhere i come
think it makes you very centered in a way.
not that you're not centered otherwise you're but
there is a layer of comfort that comes in.
yah. it's almost like it was 20's
like the wild west.
hmm.
you know, go out in the world.
see heart break failure all than in your 30s
you kind of want what school and college
felt like again
yah.
in a different way.
i think you do, yah.
like i remember in my 20th i used to
dread having kids as a concept because
i was like i wouldn't be able to put my
mind through what school and college felt
like again. and now at 32 i'm hungary for
it again.
oh you want kids as well. how lovely ranbir?
i think you'll be a great dad by the way.
yah. i'm i'm a little skate. might be
tough as a dad.
you think so? yah.
you think you be a bit strict?
i really think so i'm scared for my
own kids but i'll try balancing it
out.
but i be you will get someone who you like
very soft. so will balance it out.
yah. yah. the both of you. that's also
important in a way.
the most like important thing my
parents have done for me when i was
among the likes i can write a book on
dec. but the one thing that stands out more
then anything is that, my mom saw as a
very high energy kid and put me in a
martial arts. lovely. egged it on. going,
going, and like level martial arts and
then i stopped marshall. but leave me with this
like, really like fighter, discipline,
mentality
discipline and date.
everything good came from dot.
or. yah.
ah so, i'd want to put guy, girl
don't go to martial arts.
or. martial arts and dancing, so mai
parents put me in too belly, which is a
very different, not a normal form of dance
that people would put their kids in. i came to sleep
have learned bailey for eight years. and really
discipline hard work you know it all comes
from there
or we had vidyut jammwal on the show some time
or and i first ask him about yoga and
stretching and he said that both marshall
arts and dance is like yoga and motion
or absolutely very well said
shift something inside you
or does it does
or also the world becoming a fitter place
or and it also brings in a lot of
confidence in you i feel you know where
you're younger than it's not about oh which
car am i going to do you know which brand
t-shirt am i wearing it's more about
what am i or i want to instill that
in my kids so no binance plastics no
nothing it's gonna be about
yah what are you how talented not even how
talent you are loved unconditionally but what are
you are what your skills are
or you know the challenge is how do you give a rich
baby a middle class mindset so that's it
live through and maintain its own rich it's so
important i feel very-very very
important to.
yah.
or.
fatherhood and motherhood.
so, we spoke about marriage, kids? yes.
inside the right sanskar,
this is the conversation i had with you even met
you a part.
i thought so. but imagine we met at a
party, we would be speaking like this for
like really a long time. but it's very rare
that you meet people that you can really engage
with and have a conversation. especially for
me, very difficult.
or no, no.
again, one of two episodes that i knew
gonna happen.
or honestly even before you message. i have
seen you on rennels show back.
renals i remember oh my god.
2017 and 2018
or that was my initial
entry into this world, right?
munna michael
munna michael ya.
and my thought that that point was o need to
host nidhi on the shot some point.
how sweet? so it's taken a good eight years,
seven years?
since years it took its time but divine
timing.
hmm
could have spoken you for six more hours.
i think so because there's so much i feel like
i still have to say but great ya.
you know i mean at the end of this i just
like to say i'm looking forward to yours
next two three years.
i thought looking forward to my marriage.
marriage also. i know you want to attend.
i'm kidding. i'm kidding.
i think i think the next three years
of your lives are going to be very magical
and i say that because i feel everyone
the external world becomes the internal world
and your internal world is like full of
magic.
thank you.
so like that's what i've felt
everyone has failed.
yah.
just wish you more peace and spirituality
energy that you're accumulating because of
practice whatever you're doing. because of you
definitely doing something. or.
and it's helping every room that you enter.
so, thank you. thank you so much. means a lot.
it was lovely and i have the most amazing
conversation with you. you are a lovely person
and you have such a clean ora and such a clean
heart and you work so hard. it's not easy
to make it you know where you made it to. so
i am super proud of you.
thank you. thank you. that means a lot. that
means a lot. ah hope to see you again over the
years. yes for noise
ok thank you thank you
