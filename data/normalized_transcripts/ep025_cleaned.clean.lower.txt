the cost of working alongside you is very
very high.

yes. why?

hand.

that's just fear me like why? the world dew
nothing to you. people say that you feel zero
problem firing randomly. you treat
people are disposable. as long as there is work
okay. fuck the days that get a little bad

lakh. we're the only company who has
created so many jobs. [music]

for
0.1% people who don't know who you are.
who are you?
interesting question
for the 0.1% people who don't know who i am
i think i'm a child like curious
person
who just wants to do things
that's it that's it that's it nothing else
define you, i am the founder of zomato.
i am a billionaire. i have this.
i turned rags to riches. i don't know
identities that you give to yourself.
i don't have any of those things.
never define yourself like this in your
head. people do and
whenever they try to do it my
you have to stop yourself from doing this
define yourself.
why?
because then you lock yourself into just that.
then you can't become anything more than just
that. no
but isn't it? work hard for that.
got it done that's something that you should be
like you should own that i made it with this hard work
i worked so hard for this identity, isn't it?
this is made by hard work but that identity
i did not make it for
ok
so i didn't do this for fame didn't do this
for money i was just curious
meaning one step after the other this happens
never in your life have you fucked me
want to earn a lot of money
never
you had butt
a poster on your wall in your childhood
thought i was to lead this heard my dad
from this last couple of months ago i was
i was born to lead i was never born to
b ruled
something like that or
so this poster was put up since then
there must be aspiration, there must be ambition that i
so i will only lead, i will become great
shot it could also be that i used to be a bully
all my life in childhood. so it could also be
my revolt towards that. i don't know. i
don't remember why was that poster? how
was?
it's a bully for what. what a bully
were?
a so right now you can see i'm like 6 feet
tall. but i basically gained about a foot and
and half when i was 12 years old.
ok.
so i used to be a very short dark
stemming kid. we
so it means small, black, stummers.
and i used to be bad at my studies
well.
we
so all of these things combined was like
nobody likes my friends' parents used
to tell them. don't be friends with him.
why?
because intelligent good marks coming
so the child [laughs] should have friends. so
so i think all of these were good
i mean that poster is also a bit stupid
because i got 42% in 10 plus one
marx and something like that.
so that poster and that [laughter] just doesn't
make sense it does make sense because like this
only those from marx bring it. [laughter]
but what's the use to bother? the most
what was the problem? when people say such things
they used to say that what is this, you are black.
it doesn't surprise me that you are small enough to like everyone.
i thought what was pinching me more in that life?
mostly he used to pinch me whenever i did something.
when i spoke, people did not listen.
so mid sentence people used to start
talking about something else and stop
listening and look away right and it's like
that whatever he says is of no use and this
he will be able to say whatever he wants to say.
no. right? so two things combined. i
think that was the
like you never biggest hurt probably.
or
and sometimes it happened at home that mom and dad also
have you said something which disappointed you?
off course
it was all part of the package.
so even the family members are talking about it.
they used to point this out. they did use to
point it out they were actually supportive in
terms of stumper that this is in your head
this solution will go, speak easily, speak comfortably.
where ever i used to sing i could
horn
so i didn't write at that time.
so give a like, see you are singing to me
what is the problem in speaking so my
home was actually supportive
ok
but you know even if your home is supportive of you
don't think of that as valid right like that
the world is telling the truth. it's your job
i love to do. it's your job to do that
by saying this you mean a lie.
will keep speaking. i think that might also have been
going on.
does it still bother stammer?
makes me nervous so for example this one
also means it is not easy and comfortable
for me to do this. that's why i do less
of this. but now i'm like okay man
meaning i will get stuck. finally the word is out
he will definitely come. meaning [laughter]
but you still look like i might be the one
is there insecurity or is it a challenge that comes
have to see you stammering as that
not really not any more as i'm very at
peace with it, it's okay, it will stick, see?
will be seen i think that also comes with that
even if i stammer people will now listen to me
right so that i've earned a little bit of
that's okay now i don't care
otherwise i used to care that well i will
get judged people will stop me people will
stop sort of like listening to me attention
everything you are used to will tune out.
make me nervous and bother me now i'm like
okay five second pause doesn't matter right
mental change
i think it gradually changed over the last
five years and it's still not over
meaning it has happened
there is little inside
it will always remain inside and will never be complete.
so
but you said i don't do interviews.
doesn't talk much publicly. how do you
lead a company? if stammering in the mind
that's why i don't do interviews
does. speak at a board meeting in a company
will have to do. inspiring people
there will be large town halls. to the investor
will have to pitch. so then it's not a bodger
does. let me ask a trivia. guess our
when was the last town hall held? where i
i will speak.
i don't know. one month ago three, one quarter
ego.
stretch it. a year ago.
stretch [laughter] it.
what is the matter.
so you don't do it?
na i think it's been seven eight years since
i did it townhall.
so you haven't addressed everybody at once.
no i
in these 7 years.
i just maybe bibi i think the seven-it years
ego town hall was also something that i was
force two. i mean bad time. i had to
really puts things back and in shape. but i just
cain note. i do slack townhalls. so chat
but i do townhalls like so one
messages and people like reply to them
threads make and then next
message next message i do townhalls on
text
i the reason is taming
yes i just can't do this too much effort stage
public presence they're just not my thing
interesting and then investor pitches
investor pitches so there one on one
it's cool that you're finding
was there any point where an investor
pitch curry and because of you're stammering you
felt nervous and maybe that deal was lost.
somebody pointed that out not really may be
people chose not to invest in zomato because
of that may be i don't know because they wood
never tell you right on your face but i didn't
feel that
but have you ever made the mistake of being in a room and
you want somebody may be you want a client
and you want investments at that time
you sensed that he doubted my ability
i hope i can inspire such a great team.
i will be able to, i will be able to lead.
no, never in my mind.
you never ft it.
never ft it.
are there words that are still very difficult
are there. stutter on which
it's very random. i just like
like i stutter on certain syllables
this like double also like something like that.
like so
well, it is not listed as if it is not there.
can't say 100 can't say. it's not like that. nothing like that. it's not like that.
and on a good day i can talk about
anything. so it's not like it's a chronic
that this is not a structural issue.
have mental issue.
[laughter]
have you tried to fix it?
i'm done fixing it. i am if i try
to fix it it also means that i have to
tell myself that i'm still bored with
it.
so i've just stopped telling myself that
i boarded with it. so i just moved down.
butt never went like that. many founders
and public figures, celebrities those classes
they go, they go to doctors.
let's do stuttering exercises.
improve themselves. all of that was that
part of life was never needed.
can i [laugh] go? and i think
that also made me learn how to write really
really well. we
so i think what i lack for in terms of
being able to talk i can more and less cover
up in terms of how i write so
fair
it goes
you said it has helped you make turns
you into a better writer
we right so thats
but then in the middle of it you said something
now that i have achieved, maybe now people
we will listen now, we will listen now, it doesn't matter
no matter what i say, weather eye stammer
not stumper and doesn't care. do you think that
is there something that shaped your life that i achieve
only if i do it will people praise me. only then
will listen to me. so i have to achieve
regardless.
i think so that was the primary factor
why i wanted to do a startup.
we
why i wanted to do a successful
startup. right? and that wasn't that friend
ok me
the world has to make its point heard. it was not
about that. it was about that my friend
immediate social circle the people who i wanted
to call friends they would value what i
from.
so what happened was worse than what came
want.
what you wanted but initially start like this
what happened was that i was not respected. a little
if you respect me then i want to achieve
in hand set i feel so
because
but at that time i didn't know
clarity why i am doing this
may be you new because there is one in a class
whenever you cheat, you come third to your teacher.
gone
we
and you did some whatever you achieved
and become your girlfriend that very day and at that time
you became friends, you got praise at home, so you
got some validation not praise from achievement
it happens and people listen to you
yes but that too now i am speaking in hindsight
i know that this happened. this happened logically.
right? at that time life was just happening.
i didn't consciously think that i had to do this,
why to do it, i am like this, i am like this
let me do this. i think you guys know your age
generation knows this a lot more about yourself.
at our age we knew nothing about
ourselves. when we were 20, tees.
nothing zero self. nothing was happening.
awareness.
even we know jack shit our life. we're just
better at pretending.
we're just trying to make sense out of us
life but attest you know words like
anxiety but we don't even we [laughter]
don't even know words like that back then.
you know there's a research that really
public big public figures and celebrities
and founders who stammer. them
anxiety is social anxiety that people think about me.
what will you think about and how will you judge me?
will do. do you think it's true in your case?
no
no never think what people will think
about me.
i mean, okay, we'll think about it [laughter]
so it has nothing to do with it.
fine or but ok. so starmer has nothing to
do with anxiety.
no.
it's just been there forever. it's just been
there's forever and i've just liked
consciously avoided being in situations
where the nervousness of that stumper would make me
fall sick for example
so that means i have sometimes said yes to
okay, i will come to the conference.
feeling brave and then two days before i
used to fall sick
ok this was my body revolting against
that thing that i had to do two days from
now so now i just like stop saying yes
why do anything i was like
quit so when you're a kid non achiever
makes no sense no one's listening
you are small and even your family members are becoming bullies every day.
making parts in sorted packages
write what was going on in your head what
used to go what you think at that time
what was the point that i am useless?
i will show you off
man i i don't think as much as i know i
don't think that i've ever thought about the
long term
we
i've i've i've always been focused on
the next day and the next week so which
also comes down to building companies
ok
so that means if you ask me about zomato
what is the next 10 year vision i don't know
so we're very focused on these are the
problems we need to solve let's just
solve them
so
been like this since childhood
this is how i have seen childhood, one week ahead.
haven't seen beyond that.
and do you feel inferior now
in what sense?
in any sense have you ever got an
inferiority complex that may be me
not good enough? may be someone's better than me
the impostor syndrome continues. bus
[laughter]
what happens? explain impostor
syndrome for you. what is it? impostor
syndrome is like that you got here
are you actually good enough to get here right
so and because you know whatever you do success
there is no one there is like a
huge element of luck in it
like you can't dissociate luck from anybody
success people don't like to say that but that's it
true for everybody so now when you are
when you consciously think i got lucky in
so many places and then you get all the
like credit for building this. it
sometimes feel like a little bit of despair
looks like it's not matching.
everything. [laughter]
tell me one place where you think in handyside
that's where you've got an absolutely lagi.
on incident.
i also i think that
my introvert nature and all this like comes
with like me stammering aspers
it's all like the combination i like
the introvert nature i think i got
extremely lucky with that so
why do you think it's this feeling
off
why is it a feeling that is very
well, i am lucky that i was an introvert.
i was bullied. wow. [laughter]
what kind of feeling is this? pros and cons of everything
there are x's. i think so the kind of
connections and relationships that i've had
with people. right? so let it run very deep.
we
so like zomato is a system built on
trust.
we
right? so people trust me, i trust them.
so i mean the kind of repo we share is not
something that you see in companies. so and that
comes from me being just me right so and so
that introverted nature likes i open up very
easy. i'm into being vulnerable
doesn't take me that much effort to be willing in
front of anyone. so, and that builds
bonds. we and their bond last forever.
it's so i and i think that i've been very
lucky with that around me.
true do you think about your father in the beginning
when you started zomato they started on you
must have trusted that friend will do it
they must be doubting something or the other.
so
when i quit my job
he actually sent me 2 lax which was
almost all his savings
to let me run this business
ok
none of us new what startups were at that time
are there? what are valuations? nun
no idea right. so and like achcha kuchh
trying to do.
let's try it. son ok if i don't
back him who else would i back right. i came to sleep
think he had and and it should have been
a mix of confidence and fear. [laughter]
but has he ever said something like this, man?
are not ambitious. don't fly so much.
because he was a teacher. right? otherwise a teacher
to think about and make a comprehensive
that my son went to a good it
got a job at a very good place and left it.
what is this menu card scanning?
i don't think, i told them i would
what am i doing and why am i doing it?
so was like is doing something good. and
look my mom and dad have probably
like have had restaurant food 20 times in
their life.
we
correct. so they didn't even know this space.
like they don't understand this so they are
like ok doing something must be doing
it's fine
and how was your relationship when you were a
kid with them with mom with dad
man i think so i actually got out of
home when i was 15 years old
ok
so 15 years old and 10 + 1 10 + 2
hostel hostel hostel so i've been
disconnected since forever asleep
we're a family are connected
we're close but we're no longer like
no, together we remained apart till now
till then
djaunter you
never have the time to think about it man
actually don't think about the things it is
like what work is there now let's finish the work
let's do i'm very focused on the
mom and dad live together now
give lease by so
ok keep visiting them
i keep visiting
and you have you never thought that we could be together
it wouldn't have been much better if we had stayed, wouldn't it all have happened?
of that
me and my dad can't put pradeeksha
why [laughter]
tell me this i mean the apple doesn't fall way
far from the tree, i am stubborn and so are they
have and you put us in the same room like if we
have a difference of like opinion about
something it just like blows up
tell me an incident where a fight happened
it's very simple things kiss
this was a couple of years ago why this car
you took it, you spend a lot of money, vaas.
like papa, i felt like i was having.
bad day you had a bad day and you lost 3 crores
you took the car, you have gone mad, you go out.
don't show my face from here and that's it
like got like furious at it and then i
like i also got furious first end
then i hugged him it's cool it doesn't matter
chill the car will sell for the same money whenever
it wages [laughter]
that's you making out shed it's not sugarcane
sell for the same price males [laughter]
we have to make makeup shut also.
so even today he has these problems.
or i mean
so now the son has grown so much, so much
if you are earning money then it is different from 2-3 crores.
it will take a little.
i think it's about the mindset and i
also still have that mindset. i money
i don't throw away peacocks and laces. so
nice. what is the one thing where you throw it?
money.
i think the only place where i really came
feel that i wasted money is by cards.
why? i don't drive them. we
a day just does like a childhood dream
of buying toys. so
having a bad day. emotional ups and downs
let's keep going. right? so sometimes you are
feeling the vacuum and then i buy
give them. lucky cars also sell for almost the
same price the one
cars that you buy
so sometimes more than that [laughter] because rare
laser
or
how has it ever happened, ok forget it?
tell me a low day where you were feeling
something and what were you feeling because of which
bought a car from
you don't remember it i wouldn't have that
memory
we
you know people who were treated like this in their childhood.
pray for something
expy thing and they are told that
you are so wonderful. achievement base love is
a thing and then the rest of the time they don't love me
get it. you get love only on achievement. give
and growing up very rich, very
successful and being very empty.
nothing is salt at all. that bus
keep running towards the next chase. do
you're like that?
you can say i used to be like that. ok.
but now i have enough acceptance and love in
life. i mean i have faces of it.
we
so sometimes it comes, sometimes it goes. but right now
now i am happy. [laughter]
right now there's nothing? which is
interesting. ok. and talk to me about
that day. when you cheated with a teacher,
did you feel that friend, i am third from this cheating
it's here, so is cheating okay in life?
s long s this is making me win.
i don't think i got to that point.
so it was very funny. i fully remember the
visual. which examination hall should i go to?
was sitting on the third seat from the left.
what was happening now? i correct like
vividly remember fully. we
and i have no idea why that teacher
help me out. i have zero clue. it was
out of the blue
that guy helped me and he left after a
couple of months. he was on transfer rights.
so and then only left end
so
my dad always like you know government job.
so always used to keep fighting against
corruption etcetera so i've grown
up with values morally very very
russians
and
so i never turn towards a point of
friend, cheating is ok but right but for a
moment out of desperation i tried to cheat
the next time myself consciously because
i didn't cheat for the first time either
someone got it done. [laughter]
so second time i tried to cheat. i could
couldn't find a way to find a
question paper anything right. so and then
and then some how last minute i could get to
a decent place and then it's like okay this
is the kind of effort it takes to score
well. it wasn't my learning. even back
then was that okay it takes less effort to
score well. i think that would be stupid too
say it's not about less effort and more
effort. it's about the right kind of
effort.
how will you focus? understanding by going to fundamentals
if you do, you will build everything up later.
right?
so i think that was what i
sort of softly learned.
sir, if you try tuning it, you will get it.
will go. don't cheat. some kind of jugaad
by doing.
the right kind and not just effort for the shear
effort. like like right kind of effort
find out. what is its crux? to the crux
understand well. and then you can build
build on top of that. you can build
whatever you want build on top of that.
true and then started studying here.
now this was the turning point from where efforts
started killing. started reading a little. give you
wait to chandigarh.
we
chandigarh for iit tuition.
yes.
and there you said that you felt very dumb.
you flew out of the place. because all
there were smart people around. yes, all of them
best toppers of small cities of punjab
there were people there.
so [laughter]
you were placed lowest, right d section
in.
ya ya lb and me both of us were last too
peepal.
so you and you both met there.
or we met at ntsc the national talent
there used to be a coaching camp for search in punjab.
i don't know weather it still happens or
not. so even there we were the last to people.
that is a batch of 96 people. we are 90 rank 95
and rank 96 likes [laughs]
so these two last benchers of the smart
female. so you guys reached there and then you
said you're feeling out of place. why?
i was i think low confidence again that this
so i can't do it. peepal way var
grasping things, people were scoring
things like higher than me. and i just
felt like i'm in the wrong place. we
and a lot of times i think i used to
think yaar mukha sir go back sabzi
let's open a shop and chill. this is
very hard. why do you have to work so hard?
life is going to be good there. [laughter]
but you felt you had to use specifically a
word uninvited guest. that you feel like this
i thought i was an uninvited guest.
here. why this feeling?
because nobody paid attention like don't understand
was coming. it's like some different language
being spoken right so even classrooms lessons
i be it was just like always
catching up to understand what's going on
not coming and then always scoring low
sometimes i used to compare myself with a child like this.
to
peepal was walking around, meaning i was there.
the cow
my roommate was like top 10% quart
quart top 10%
was in the ki percentile and i used to
be the lowest and what else did we compare ourselves to?
used to go on same tuitions. same tashan's
they also used to conduct test tests. so
we used to know the scores.
there were no comparison scores but we used them.
to know each other scores. right?
and the comparison was in my own head. may be
it wasn't in their head. so butt in my
on my head i was like man i am so daft
i. so that's what you ever told me
parents call from chandigarh that friend i am
i am very stupid. coming back or ever crying
in frustration that my friend is not my father
is getting. i actually didn't want to do
je exam.
why?
so i was like this won't happen to me. me
nothing comes.
we
and i will give next year.
let them all go. i'll take my time.
i can't think of anything. so i don't want to
be like embarrassed.
so i just told my dad and he was like
disappointed that the friend was doing fine.
you are saying such things just now.
but he said okay cool if that's what you are
going to do
and what kept you going then why
did?
as like papa was like fee di hai saale one
at least practice for the bar exam.
[laughter]
so i said okay let's do it.
practice and the exam was i think too
three months a way at that time end
physics books. so my roommate likes it
used to have all this stack of books which
which which which which i used to be
scared to touch when opened and
there will be more insecurity.
and one fine random day i opened a physics
the book was not there in the right room.
heat gone somewhere i think gone to him
hometown.
and i turn the first page and without
thinking of i have to solve it. not
trying to achieve something and i was like
i think this is how it will work answer
compare nice good and it just went on so
for a month and two i was just solving his
physics books
so that's it and then i went to
that exam i'm thinking about next time
i will go hmm
but physics was like i had a grass
profit
so i think i scored quite a lot there
and you don't need to score much for je too
get in so [laughter]
i won't know i've only heard it's the
toughest thing
i think so too but atlast that time it was
i don't know how it is right now but ya i
i scored enough in think physics
a lot as much as i know 100 out of 100
probably chemistry must have cut off pass
must have done maths and must have passed the cut off.
i and that landed me in it delhi.
so this is this luck. not [laughter] that much
have strong luck.
this is also luck.
probably not the introvert thing this is
like a crazy luck and how your end alibi
relationship and friendship turned out to be
in these years. our friendship has had it
like ups and downs waves. not just i
ups and downs from wood knot. like where we
are close to each other and then we drifted
apart close to each other drifted apart
i think we've had multiple faces of that
give me one incident where it's too tight
the and then one incident where very
10 plus one we are different in 10 plus two
tight i think first year of college also
we are very tight and then iit and then
i think the second third fourth year only used
to be on different things i was on
different things so divergent we still
connected but not like super close not like
that far away
then i think then i think he left to the
us to work completely lost touch three four
years later i got him to like zomato
state together for two three years
then he started grofers and then we
again lost touch and then covid happened and
then we came back again
you just said that you had borrowed money from the bank account.
for personal what was that
i ran out of cash during covid
personal cash
personal cash
not the company
we
so personally you had nothing
nothing
what you borrowed from lb
what did you tell him how was the
conversion
way easy lb can you please send me some money
right he was like how much i like this much
he like cool [laughter] did you feel bad no we
have always through lb and me and not just
lb and me i think our friend circle age
well like so back to college days
we have always operated out of shared purposes
of money it has never been yours, yours, yours
how much is mine how much is you me this much you
may we don't keep account
even today
even today
how many of friends like kitne ho
right now it would be like four of us like
we just don't keep
give two of them in dubai so bankers so
[laughter]
i mean we don't need to do that any more
right but we wouldn't keep counting like so if
somebody ask like cool done to
never ask questions
never ask questions never ask for the money
back as well.
hmm.
and what makes you so sure about this
friendship?
it's just like we've supported each other
through so many ups and downs? nobody's ever
ask it back and nobody ever likes it
abuse the trust that you have with each other?
so, cool.
did you give the money back?
must have. i don't remember.
or i don't remember must have. but you
you have a problem since that day.
we
there is a problem since day. in boring
there is a problem. it does not happen with these four.
this is this is like family money. right?
i mean, why take money from your brother?
will there be a problem? so
and why is money a problem anyway?
from date? what's that trauma?
i mean if i like what if i say something
to somebody and i'm not able to do it.
what will that entity and that person will do
to me? i don't know. i don't want to think
of two things. explain [laughter] i mean
i don't want to get into this situation
where a collection agent is knocking at my
door and saying bro listen that i don't know
unreasonable
irrational but i just can't do that.
so there came a point where zomato was almost
about to shut down
and at that time you have to back boro
i will do back borough equity. back borough
will not dept. why? just from this region
that's just my personal way of doing
things.
so you never had day rage, right? never rage date
always have equity in some businesses it does
genuinely makes sense to raise date
we're not in these businesses yet. [laughter]
correct. and i will have to be okay
when does business happen to us raging that
but i would choose not to if i had it
makes sense not to have
is it family tuning
this is how they used to speak at home
family tuning as well but i don't know but
it's tuning some like in my head i
always tell my parents or everyone at home
i became very happy after hearing this.
i don't want to borrow money
don't take loan for anything
don't take loan like the first time i came
remember
there was so much fighting for a car loan.
me and i was like it's financially smart
it's like i have the money, i park it
i am living and loan separately and just like a
three month fight so in my house that's why
my tuning comes in that my date and
i have a lot of problems with credit but now i have come.
have got better with it but with your family and
just you're family and i think like
day so you know i think when you take day
you're cashing into your future
future's friend, i have money in the future.
i will earn it, you are cashing it today
what if you don't make the money in the
future what happens i don't want to
answer that question for myself and so i
i very much like the amount of money in the bank
that's how much money is in that's about it
live
you're ok to shut down let's say business
understand personal life for
there is no money for business. now the only way
that equity is not being raised.
the business will be closed. to give a loan
is ready.
so you will take a loan to continue your business.
for. you are not like me, i will close my business.
will give but will not take loan. i think if
your equity is not getting raised
right now and your debt is rising
that debt will be worst for the business then
the equity at a lower price. we
so i'd rather lower the price for
equity and get equity then take day.
debt at a time when equity is not rising
taking from a week stand from a
if you are taking debit at the point of weakness
then that's even worse i think.
okay walk me through what goes on in your head
when it's near death situation. so let's
pick up at specific covid time
probably 5 million calls had to be made at night.
to race the dollar. right? so give me something
give it also. [laughter]
yes tell this story.
no we're just like so look we have
cost
we
and suddenly
the food delivery business got just like
wiped out shut down right blacked out right.
so and we still have that cost.
so first how many four to five months do we have?
there will be money like in the bank and suddenly we
are down to only 45 days money left.
it was that
because revenue almost
revenue was completely wiped out, right?
cost is cost is cost is cost
so that's one i was like yer one and half
months are over and i've never come that close
i've always been at four months five months
that's an okay i can fight this one for me
one and a half month is scary
right so one and a half months is like if you
make one wrong call you're not able to meet
roll and i've never been in a situation like this
ever where i've not made it right so
always pay salaries on time it scares
me too not pay salary on time
so and i was like a two million anything
i'll be able to meet the next
pay roll problem
so what did you do to whom?
everyone likes investors.
were on capitatable
how was a conversation
this is the situation reality is very very very
factual this is a reality like wood
appreciate it if you can like by one too
to$million whatever i wrote i was like char
one will get one from people, one will get four from one
same thing right so
and how much money was raised at that time?
zero
no one gave
nobody had the time and everybody was
struggling with their own issues right and
nobody liked it was feeling like the end of the
world for everyone. so they are like dude
i have 1 million for you, i don't have time.
have to do all this now. please figure this
out.
how much was the burn at that time?
if you don't remember then it will be 45 million per month.
and then no one will give you money for 45 days.
has been. how did you come back from that?
so what we did was
we asked for salary cards. we we didnt
ask whether it is 20% for everyone or 30% for everyone.
we had a goal in mind that we got something
think 30%
salary bill has to be less but we regretfully ask.
for salary cards that's your choice as much as you are
take as much salary card as you can afford.
we
and in return you get 2x
e shop will give 2x or 3x i don't remember
the numbers but the significant number of eshops
compared to the cash that you let go by the way
we didn't tell people that will give you eshops
ok
so ok we ask for salary cuts.
well, it was not mentioned that you will get 2x. ok
then that's wet. i don't like that. so right
thought it in my mind but didn't say it.
yes ok.
ok. we said, take salary cuts.
and
we met the target and more wantily like
people some people said 100% salary cut.
some said 50 some said i can't do it.
right? because they have to support families and
are like good this makes sense because if
people can afford all they can they have done all
and if somebody couldn't they didn't. so a flat
this model is better than 30% salary cut
is.
and over 80% people took a cut. out of n
organization of about 4000 people.
wow!
voli and they got his shops. and then the day
we got listed. so i think if they let go
off ₹100 off cash they made 30x in that
ipo for that equity that they got
equity was given to them as a thank you so
much here's the equity
you have company in the bad times so now the
company's good time is here so we help you
we gave them aesop like two days after
good
same salary
immediately
yes, i gave it immediately but it was not.
n exchange
we
interesting best thing you ever did
think at any point that the company will close down?
is this over?
it can happen anytime, it can happen even now.
[laughter]
but there was a time when the conviction went to zero.
brother may not be able to come out of this today.
not really always felt like we have still
one more day. [laughter]
have you ever doubted that it won't be made?
what can't be done?
zomato
did we ever even have a vision of
have to make. we know this week's work
what should be done? but never money
maybe we won't be able to make it or it might be over. now this
it won't be possible even in a week. end of the week.
like
no one ever imagined how much money
how many to make? lb is also like this. i
i am also like that. we never thought about this is
the amount of money we want to make which is
doing things because we want to do things.
so how did you talk to investors?
investors must be saying this, right?
give a prediction, tell me something.
we never give predictions to investors.
no financial model, nothing.
nothing. we told people this is how it is
going till now. and this is what we
have. we don't know the like future et al. and
that's all. and even today the organization
works in such a way. we don't have we don't
have quarterly goals, annual goals,
nothing.
so we trust people to do the best job that's done
they can and they and they do. i have to
questions now. [laughter]
the first is that whenever you talk to an investor
you do it, you have a picture or a vision
you must be painting. what was that vision?
that vision is generally a market size vision that
man look this market is going to be
hughes. hm
so and we're playing for that now we're
get there we don't get there it's going to
be an result of the 10 steps that we take
over the next few years so and we could
get them wrong
hmm so we're just like this market
is big
and we have a fair shot at playing
fair shot at playing and execution
look at the record so far, it's fine.
so there's no reason to believe worse ahead
hoagie so that's what you should bet on
and second is because now you're in public
now a traded company has quarterly goals.
must be happening. something had to be presented
will happen.
zero.
do you show up at agms etc?
there are no goals in agm.
there is a mindset in agm also. so far
this is.
well this is till date.
there is no talk of future.
it doesn't matter.
i don't even talk about like i
don't talk about like ceos about
next quarter. how many goals, how much
what to do? so it's always like do better
do more do better do more that's what it is
and where did this thinking come from because this is a
very
from different sort of thinking if i must
i believe that if i give somebody a goal
we
they're going to fall 20% shot of it
we correct
we
first of all how do i know that this goal is
the right goal i don't know nobody knows
or
so first of all, i don't want to negotiate.
it has to do with people that this goal is right
is it round or not? so was like if you were
are you really a good person leader who cares for you
would do your best correct. and if i give
you have a goal you will actually calibrate your
effort towards that goal and that may not be
the best effort.
true.
so your best effort could be higher or lower
give the goal. but all i want is your best
effort. but how do you judge that this person is the best
are you making efforts? how do you even judge that this
if i take a person then he is the best one.
will happen for my company. because your
there is no goal in mind. hood
achieve something.
is visible when you are like tuned in
when you know how people are like responding
how to like a customer care complaint
how people are responding to crisis
are responding to competition whatever they are
doing how much they actually innovate how much
risks they take how many risks they take you
get to get a sense of weather it's a very
subjective soft sense of weather they are
doing their best work or not.
so tell me an instant turn off instant
you are interviewing someone
are you looking for some position or a cv and
you're like these are like two three red
flags. immediately you know that this is not
have to do.
and when people sell themselves too much
just switch off completely. because we know that
nobody is awesome even in our team even
like me, no one is perfect. so
that's when people oversell themselves
when we switch off that this is going to get
this person like messi will become political
here on
that the husband is praising me a lot
then we will not do the rest either.
that's what basically means that you're saying i
did all the work my team wasn't a part of
it right fair
so and nothing happens with one single person
it team pulls off whatever it needs to be
world of
and what's something that you like in n
interview which you feel that this is right.
vulnerability, humility and
how do you judge that?
put people in a tough spot. i mean you know how
to judge, judge them. you do podcast. [laughter] butt
you put people in tough spots, you ask hard
questions and you see how they actually
respond to dose questions. so
give me an example of that's a hard
ask questions in an interview.
i just talk to people and then i get to know
more about them. and the hard question is
about them. right? so it's not from
a laundry list of topics. it's very
personal. no
something that they must have shared immediately.
late say if i was in front of you had
to ask me a personal hard question?
what would you ask?
eh do you get tired doing all of this?
there are days when i do.
like absolutely.
and what and what really goes on in your
head when you get tired?
that
why do you have to like this, like this?
why should i do this but it is very temporary
this feeling arises because of how many times it comes now.
this is a temporary feeling, once a week
comes in a month
after every bad podcast
after every bad podcast comes its own
does not come apart
when
many times it comes even when the team is in great doubt.
looks like it looks like, man, i
i'm doing so much, i'm working so hard
i am doing everything and my like i am
doing my best and i'm tired of this
i can't see that i'm tired, man.
am and like it why to do this at all
okay, i live my life normally.
what can i do by being so ambitious?
lunga and that's what i get but it's
it's a feeling that it goes away once i came
sleep and then get up sometimes it goes away
it's never happened on like in an hour that
stay for 10 days max never a day
live
so
so on these lines i can go deeper and deeper
and deeper right i'd just like peel the
onion until it hurts right so that's why
what were you thinking that why
why do you think that
underline
what is inhibition or feelings aspiration
because of which you want to quit
we
there is some emotional insecurity which
makes you feel bad when the bad podcast
hits and why is the team saying what?
is it
you don't want to be a leader
leaders don't have time to do all this
of. you can't be tired of figuring out your
like energy are you a leader and are you part
off the team? you're part of the team of course
but you have to lead you can't be tired
or
and so i would then dig fair
interesting right [laughter]
taken to the zone
but yes the answer to me in that situation is that
but i am human and this thing i do is part of the team.
i rarely show it in front, maybe my
three-four top team members must have seen it too.
and i show them my majority.
will not present the team in front of 70 people.
absolutely absolutely
yes i will put up in like i before them
can't be the low version of me
or even during your best days you have to
walk into your office and smile right so
best days worst days all of this like so
it's a question for you as well now
that
leadership style is contradictory
there is one type of
mindset: whatever you think, i am also like this.
i think you're having a rough day
everything is going well, whatever is going on you have
to have an athlete mindset and you have to
show up and you have to go hit a century you
can't show in front of the team that you are sad
yes, because if you are sad then others will be.
you will become more demotivated, right so you
have to just
like buckle up and show that aaj to fodne wale
we are regardless of what's going on
and then there is one type of leadership which
jaji jain alpha speaks of vulnerable leadership
that you have to show that yes man today is my day
i am bad today, i am stressed today.
i am sorry, i am feeling sad today.
it's human to show that. i'm sorry
this went wrong. all of that. right? so which
leadership do you think it's good?
do you ever think about it?
i
why do they have to be different boxes?
i think they can be the same box.
but we can't show it to you
weekdays and more in every. no sadness
can show. you have to go and chor up. no
i'd do things the way i'd do things and i'd do them.
things that listen guys we like running
i am giving an example from out a money letts
whenever we used to run out of money i put
i put 50 100 top people in the room and say
listen we're running out of money
life is gonna be bad ok i'm stressed
cool but that doesn't mean that we can't make it
breathe in breathe out let's go.
so you address this is the feeling but then
then you give the team that confidence that i
am not going to let this
situation
like get the better of me.
and i won't i'll make sure in my
best capacity is not a permanent situation.
yes.
we will win.
you manifest your wins beyond point so
we started zomato with pankaj together
and then eventually pankaj quit in i think
2018 what happened why did he quit
i think our leadership styles are very
very different
that's why it was a peacock
from rashan i wood [laughter]
are more emotional
or i was more
adventurous
we
punjabi mindset
we
so i was like let's see do this also
they also do it and they were more rational.
we
and in the handset i also became ration [laughter]
so
but or during these days our leadership
style just dwerve
when did you first
realize that there is change between us
these changes are coming because 10
we were together for years, right?
man i don't think like none of us were doze
people were we realize these things until the
realization was just like hit hard right
so there are no faces and there are no
conversations for him and me even myself
there was no talk
good
unleash it just hit and it's like shit
that's true
was there a fight? no
and then you just walked away
it's just like this isn't going to make
sense and an introspective moment for
me as well and i said yes this is not going
to make sense
but then i decided that you will not go.
they will go
it was just i had more equity like
i started zomato and ended up with joy six.
months later so
so you kept the baby
hmm
but what was the
i was like he was like you were to do
whatever you want to do with it so what
the conversation was last between you and
don't remember i was very pleasant very
how do that up
how do you bring that up with a cofounder
10 years together with your cofounder
what are you saying that you are not brother?
you will get it, go away
i think we're just like one day chatting over
drink just like mention it to meat
he menshand
yes that's what i'm feeling this and i think over
the next half an hour of trying to fight
that but also knowing that yes this is true
acknowledging beyond a point yes cool this
makes sense and it was reflection more for
me that because i knew this was on me
it's not on him
and i realize it over the next few
years that it was really more less only on
me then on him
what was on here i mean behaving
differently working thing differently like so
do you guys still talk
we or
you're in good terms
i mean decent terms just like me and
i'll be right so we go on different
parts we dever because like people who run
startups generally don't have time to
connect with anybody else [laughter] at work
right so that's a good in the part part i
think
but then see you and all your relationship
it would be very different because we were friends together.
were in and
same with pankaj but pankaj must have seen it
must be lost in some way that's lost a big
pai and may be a lost opportunity to
truly become something really
he had his equities and he also
started a new startup so it is
doing his own thing so
identity is also attached to one's own.
i also have to take part in zomato now.
i like the way you take the limelight today
i'm sure he must be thinking about it
i don't know you should ask him dose
questions
no but no, he never said it, you know?
didn't talk about this no
just started a mental wellness start
do you think that has something to do with
working along side you
i hope not [laughter]
the cost of working alongside you is very
very high do you think so
yes why
i think i demand
as much from
our people and our senior team come as much as i am
demand from myself building zomato and
any other thing
explain the kind of commitment and
you have to be obsessive about building
if something is right then the same obsession is expected.
i do i come from them i don't want want
them to think of this as job if people
around me in my senior team think of this
the job i'm out of is they have to think about this
s life they have to think of this as their own
baby and care about it and get hurt age
much as i would if something goes wrong and
that's hard for people to do
just because we're buy differently
and what are the signs?
be among the people where you think that man this
you don't think like an owner, now you think like a job.
has been.
pretty much everything [laughter]
simple examples is like you know that this is
a big flaw in the system
it will take two hours to fix it.
and you're on friday 6:00 p.m. and you
will do it on monday.
i wouldn't go home on friday 6:00 pm
right so i'd finish that job butt people
life is also personal life family
commitment
absolutely you can also go to that end
still make sure that job gets done
there's ways to get things done it's about the
the attitude that you show shows complacency.
is there
if work has to be done, it gets done, i mean
if i also have some work to do then i don't need to.
be there
we
i can find somebody to get that who is
available that day. right? so that much effort
kill it, friend. send a message on a group.
can somebody pick this up? i have to go. and
our team is good like that. we like have itch
others back wherever they want to go.
we don't track anyone on holidays.
people can take as many leaves as they want.
so we're friendly that way. but than the
commitment of like urgency has to be
there. these startups don't get built on
9 to five attitude.
they can be built on nine to five hour clocks
but they can't be built on 9 to five 9 to
five attitudes that are different things
what do you feel about the new bill?
right to talk about getting proposed to
disconnect you ride about it
that the employee after working hours
if you send a message or do some work
they won't be seen and it's their right
it's ok, cool then this owner
mentality mindset is it all not income
i'm not going to ask people to stay
connected
people who want to stay connected and care
bill stay connected and i'm not even
going to judge them of course you're judging them
you just said that's my top core team
they have to be as crazy as me if
when he turns off, he's in my mind.
there will be some change and maybe i will tell them
take life time forward with me because
voice is not that much
are they employees or are they ceos?
should ceos have the right to disconnect?
here pay or employees
someone's from top to bottom not right to
that's right then order food on weekends.
stop everyone let's go home
some businesses are 24/7 you just can't
avoid these things
so know what would you feel like if someone did
the top level management says that now
the right to disconnect is you cannot email me
am not going to reply
okay cool will give you a roll where you can
have a right to disconnect.
but then based on what the law says like the
bill says. i don't know whether it has passed yet or not
no.
let's see. i haven't i haven't thought about
it. i think it's just why you think
its going to go absolutely mad and
obsessed for everyone in the company that's why
company formed. because is it monday?
can't make it into the friday thing? become
goes. i am saying that monday to
runs friday hours. monday two
doesn't work in friday mindset. there could
be like twice a year that thing that needs
to be resolved on friday night okay that doesn't happen
happen everyday
but when that hits like what would you say
ok i'm ready to lose 10 customers over the
like weekend and i wouldn't put in dose too
hours what choice are you gonna make
but people will call it toxic that's there
call people call have you heard people call you
toxic toxic boss is very focused
and glamorizes work all day long
be obsessive be disciplined
i don't think people say that about me
no radio people se yaar
he must have been speaking very old on radio earlier.
i think some things before 2013
hain but they might say it right now as well but
i don't think that's the way people i work with
i think about it
do you push people beyond their limits
no we're telling i don't even have
goal for them
[laughter]
okay, please like it.
but in your head you judge them not who how much
how aggressive with urgency
depends on the situation. so if the sitch if if
if there's a huge bug
we
if if there is a bug which is going to
always delay your orders by 15 minutes over
the like weekend i'd put a night out and
fix it. like so entire company should put a
night out on and like basically fix
it. you can't let your customers down. c
lot of people that if you are the founder then your
because it is justified for you to have such an attitude.
you can't expect everyone
keep an attitude. we pay we pay people a lot
we give them a lot of lots of like equity
if they actually show this kind of attitude
they grow faster as well. if they don't show this
attitudes will stay where they are.
and you're okay where this. i'm cool or
and and and i don't judge people i'm just
saying it's your choice and if you don't want
do this do this don't do this if you don't
won't do this if you're the one who can
manage your family work life balance your
sense of kama your sense of peace and also
obsession at the same time it's an end
hmm
you used the word madness i don't
want anybody to be mad
hmm
obsession can happen with peace
and there's kind of people who can manage and
balance everything and still drive
the right kind of like outcomes still be
able to push for solving things overnight
when they need to end call their family listen
it won't be possible today, i'll make up for it
the next day i'll stay at home on monday
but i'll have to do this today right end
see these companies like
big startups and companies and missions don't
get built if your family is not supporting
you from behind. so it's all like a
like a
the sort of community builds
organization. it's not just the people
work in an organization.
can you do it?
peace and obsession manage at the same time.
it takes effort as it should. right? nothing
comes easy but i do it.
i'm not able to do it. i'm pretty
obsessed then for me that's what i'm trying
to find out a way how to manage both.
i think the way it sort of manifests for
me is that it's just hard for me too
sleep. so it's like my head just doesn't
switch off. so how i've managed it and
i think it's just like since the last month
i've sort of become better at it. is that
i start tuning out of everything
about an hour before i want to sleep hum
then the brain's self-inner chatter will end.
it goes away after a while and then i fall
sleep
what's your routine tell me your net time
routine to sleep for a founder is very
difficult to sleep
i'd start binding down by 8:30
good
9 max
binding means what will you do now like let's go now
don't work for an hour i'll think about what
don't even think about turning off like literally.
now put it in the drawer on the side
i will not watch f. because f is the one who
constantly ticking ticking alarm
will remain.
and if you stop looking at your f there is
not too much new in and new ideas too
just like keep popping up in front of you too
think off. so
just put the phone away. i think that's that
my magic trick. just like keep my phone
away.
and then just sit.
not seat.
i'll just lay down and stop.
push our brush your teeth. like stand your
routine. so put some nice work in music and
then your brain just inevitably likes shots
off that ok stimulation is over so
stop the stimuli and stimulation
this is mostly from our phones these days
so you're trying to get better now
or you're not before
i was terrible
whatever tell me the worst space
i mean just like super hard to sleep
like five hours a day six hours a day
was like these bonuses now days i'm able to
pull off 7 and half it [laughter] do you take any
brain supplements or vo g alpha gpc
nootropics for focus etc
nootropics no
sometimes because i'm a founder i need
to clay think clearly sharply all of that
ok fine, i will experiment.
i love things i've never liked
okay this is useful like okay this is more
less the same and even if i stop it i don't
miss it but melatonin is necessary [laughter]
i don't know how good or bad is
it's for me but i think the up side of
sleeping is better than the down side of not
i agree i am being able to sleep.
that's true but if you're a founder you lose
sleep and there's i don't i haven't met
single founder
like i probably must have done a thousand of
the podcast and i couldn't find one
he says that i sleep very peacefully.
[laughter]
i'm really wanting to meet somebody who
he is saying that i have achieved all my dreams
i have done it or am doing it and i am also
i get it. i don't know
i that's just the wiring. so we are always
thinking about more things, new things.
and you know
something is always troublesome.
i was also reading that five cofounders
abandoned after ipo in four years. right?
almost everybody good.
why? so
si told you right that i actually
expect a lot from every team.
so we call this a founder's mindset.
us in the team.
right? so and we actually reward people
really generally if they have founder. if that
if that's the founder mindset then i
started this
this experiment of calling people who joy
much later ki yaar now you have the founders
mindset towards the organization so you
can call yourself founder
we
so
that's true they had the founder's mindset
right butt
so when you say that man, people do
cofounders left i would just dissociate
these two things.
ok.
they're co-founders because they're really good,
and they had the mind set to be able to call
that. but when they leave other things kept
into the picture. so that had nothing to do
with them with founders and co and co
founders. is almost the same thing as like
pankaj that our leadership styles diverge
done.
hmm.
but one founder and cofounder said to burn out
i was gone a lot, that also happens, but i also came back.
people go [laughter]
has i think like over our life time there
will there be more than a 100 people who have left
and come back
but don't you think that those who spent so many years
till everyone who built with you
is gone
probly you are the
that's not what i'm talking about
cofounders let's go all long term
employees
they i think most of the most of the most
of the organization right now is actually
people who have been at zomato for over a
decade.
so but which core top level senior management
that was and keeps changing. ceo no 6
left within a month. pankaj left, gunjan
left.
gunjan gaurav left.
gunjan was there for like 13 14 years.
yes. meaning give all left at some point. ok. it's cool.
do you do you do it has something to do
do with you? like you're the common denominator?
man i think
everybody has their like energy cycle.
hmm
and life happens priorities change.
we
and but like zomato organizational
priority won't change for a person.
hmm
right? so when there's a divergence in
terms of end somebody's priorities are
changing and the organization's priority
needs to be something else than the exit is the
right thing and may be if it matches back some
the day they'll come back
have you ever felt bad about someone leaving?
i mean i've always been very sad but i have
also always know that this is the right thing
for them as well not just for them
it doesn't happen because of organization.
just like i'm causing them trouble.
they also know that they are also causing trouble
to the organization. because that's what
divergence means. it's a very mutual
respectable well accepted nice warm
conversation. we are true close friends all
of us.
see it's never mutual. it's just to
start with someone starts with
neither is this conversation that i am leaving or
you say you have to leave.
it's like, man, this is not working.
is.
this is not about quitting. how we are
working right now and what's happening
right now is not working. that's the
conversation.
and then how do you decide?
the exit is a three month long process
after that. once we once we sort of
identify that this is not working. give
we try to think of ok feedback for this
person, feedback for this person, we try to
fix it. we try to change. i try to
change. i tried doing things what they are
asking me to try doing things
what i'm asking them to do
not been able to get to a common
like and point and during this process
everybody learns as well right so and then we
come to a new point where we say that we are
ain't gonna work right so for all them
conversations that you've seen for all the people
that you've seen leave they've been five
times more where we've gone through this
process and they haven't left but you
never hear about them
or tell me one conversation which is which
it's hard for you and we're like let's go now
gone
are exit conversations always hard? do
you do that? and do you find a way through me
b hr and some they don't have hr? hour hr
team is like recruitment team only.
ok give only recruitment.
nothing else.
so do you navigate that conversation through
somebody else?
through people officer? go and speak directly
maybe it is not possible now.
does it himself.
has it been a situation where you regret that
man, i could have been with this person
things become softer and change a little.
i think i've lost my
cool with a couple of people
you know i mean you can do things with grace
i did not have those conversations gracefully.
how
basically like get pissed get irritated
rightfully so [laughter]
ok got really angry and it's like wd
up to them and said get out of here
like that kind of aggressive
kind of move. so
for someone
someone top s well
our top is fat 200 people are top right. so
i work with a very large number of people.
so it's like couple of dose people over a few
years. so what happened that pissed off
you are so powerful that such a good person
must be top level, tell him to leave.
lung to my face
like what this something like so i were
problem solving something and i suggested
do something, how do you solve it?
are and then that person agreed in that
meeting and write after the meeting they said
dp is saying stupid things this isn't
how this will work
and this doesn't usually happen
so when i'm saying stupid things people
say it right so that it won't work like this
this is how it will work because the subject matter expert
is that person
we
i'm just an outsider trying to poke
in give new fresh ideas so they can't walk
away saying deepi has said so no to this one
let's do it. because that will more and less
always lead to the wrong answers.
we
i'm not the person to have a high
likelihood of the right answers in somebody else
is job.
like they should be the right people like they should know.
and i was like bro we're like the top
three senior people in the team product team
and you're spreading this culture that
he said something and it doesn't make sense and
you're going to do it and on top of that you
will tell them that you're saying something
stupid you don't say it to me and then do
and then do this you don't belong here get
out of here
and then you said in a ya
i could have said it the way i am i said this
right now [laughter]
how much difference was there from late if it was level two?
it was
10 like full max full max matt and do
you do you regret some times going home
like after you go home at the same time brother
today a lot
ya ya i regret like the same minute
and then call them ego or not?
doesn't allow you to do that to you
i think
nine out of 10 times when i ever
whenever i've regretted this i've
called up and apologized
one out of 10 why i have it
just like it, don't do it, don't do it.
i'm not done with it and
then like may be if that event stayed with me
for longer i would do it as well but than the
next morning happens than you don't
even have the memory of that you moved on then
thousand end things.
do you think in building of zomato you have
hurt people? close people?
i just being purely
yes. absolutely
i mean why did you say yes. absolutely.
how did it click?
i mean sometimes i consciously do it?
you consciously hurt people.
why? because
you know all of us have this armor right so end
sometimes we're not getting it like us
i am not able to understand anything and it is coming to an end.
you know this phrase that this is not from love
manega right and all of us are guilty of
those there are things i don't love
i will accept late things with love, not you
believe like so when that patient
coaching sort of like runs out
i would then penetrate the armor and the skull
and just try to
don't try to be it's not so actually i
think
and i could be actually
bull trying to bull it myself here i come
think may be in that like moment is also
an act of care
why would i care to be angry with someone
if i didn't care about them
we
so that means you give feedback to the person.
you love someone you care
do something else why would you be
feedback and why you should even try to do
these things
may be this is the justification of my own mind
are giving
i am saying that i have just started this.
i was probably fucking bull shit.
i am [laughter] but i think that
and over time i think the
the success rate of me is what i call rock bottom.
i am. right? so i hurt people my friend i put
them to rock bottom. like their self
confidence completely goes for it toss.
right? so hit them so bad.
and i do them do this with people who i think
have insane like potential. i don't do this
with people i think have potential
it is not.
which has insane potential but there's something in there
the head is coming in their way that's when i came
wood like
make them hit bottom
four out of five people come out of it one out
off five don't
and i carry the guilt of do's one out of
five people but statistically
i see all of that process also made
these four out of five people are superbly great.
so they are the ones leading the organization now
days. but did it happen with even lb?
was. what [laughter] did?
i mean right after we
acquired blinket. i asked him too
leave.
that nickel you're not going to be able to cut
it.
give give
then he said okay it makes sense cool i believe
actually this happened twice during that
time frame
so what happened next
and then we took our cool transition
start working the next day
happens
we
give butt
then that person lives with that conversation
right then the conversation happens
was i that bad right and they also see the
change right so i think lb goes through vent
through this
month and two off
helping me change the organization also
because it's like okay you have to do it now and
also seeing the outcomes of how i would do
things along his right and then it
sort of, you open only with low confidence.
are happening. i think beyond a point open
you are not. when you are high confidence
why do we have to listen to meaning? people don't listen
nobody does that when you're rock bottom
when you are learning portal give all
open na.
but what in you said should be removed.
let's tell him to go away.
i mean i said it for the first time
i mean, why, why did you feel like leading or not?
will get?
i think there was
this is not just about lb hum
all of us are victims of these till date we
this is how we did it
so from now on it will be like this right and we don't
understand that customers change markets
change
i mean even the meanings of words
change right how you would sort of interpret
meaning 200 years ago love love hum
there is pure love and true love but now we have
to qualify love with true love [laughter] pure
love but just love was meant to be that work
or right so even like language changes
we
so we have to always look like leaders at
like trying to shed the baggage of the past
and look at everything from a new lens
every now and then end
there was truly necessary for the
transition from grofers to blink it
but what specific in him you doubt
because there were so many of grofers like this
it happens
we
like can we step please stop mentioning
that
right you can say
this is what we know ok
but let's understand our new business and
see what we need to make
this business work rather than saying this is
what works for us and this can be copied
pasted here
we may be yes
right but but may not be
can we think backwards from what this
new thing needs to be fair
so it just bored you that this again and again
this is what happens, this is what happens, don't do it
more less yes
and when you try to test people
or when you hit rock bottom,
what are you trying to taste actually?
because you said i do it on purpose. purposely
so you do it because you are some test
waiting for them to come out of it.
i'm i'm waiting for them too
introspect.
basically put their introspection hat on.
learn what they need to learn and bounce back.
and on the sides i also send enough people
with try to support them, help them.
you have to play bad cop good cop sort of
and you fire people who become complacent.
asking me too many things. these are like
secrets. now, next time i put people
on rock. [laughter]
this process will not working.
they will know that this thing is going on and
then it doesn't work or tests are going on
tests are going on.
once you once you know that this is what
being done it doesn't work any more.
but there really is a poor guy who needs to be fired.
you are the one. he thinks about the test and he hopes about that.
stay in me and woe betide the fire. listen to this
after.
nowadays it's very. butt giver
are you ditched by firing people?
no it's always very hard.
now so many people must have done it every day
will happen.
it's it's the same as the first one you
never has never become easier.
why?
i know i mean the life that you're there
there's a life in front of it's not just a
like person is not employee code na meaning de
are the people and the people i
i'd fire and i'd ask to leave are the
people that i've worked with we're right so and
we have had we have shared space we have
shared ups and downs so it's so i
there's almost zero reason for me
to ask anybody i've met to go
so there's always like personal attachment
because you sort of enjoy working
we them you build things with them and at
what point it goes to man
personal chat attachment aside this is less than my
will have to bring a new person in his place or
this one has to be removed and someone else brought in.
i think the most important thing that's everything and
that's what we really really need
that's a person's ability to learn and their peace
of learning should never stop. right? so there
they should always become better. they should be
better learner today than they were last week.
how do you judge that they are not learning?
annie more.
is visible. stuff is happening. how much
are you learning? how many questions are you asking?
you
like someone who is
someone who is a learner asks more questions
give give answers to
correct
i think so
fair eye someone
samvat so this is i i don't have a written one
answer for this like
yes instinctively things like that
we
like it's an instinct based out
of observations that you do
and so you have also i was reading somewhere
that
many people became compliant after ipo
we have to make a call that you have to
let them go because some people
earned money or some people may give it
have thought that marathon is over whatever
how did you realize that
these similar things that were just chilling
now they are in that zone are they so
were not aggressive
i think there's also this thing
one behavior peculiar
this is the peculiar one that
no senior person has any problem
have to solve late they are running n
organization meetings to meetings
it would have been so easy to play devil's advocate
is
we
someone comes with some problem
it comes with a suction so you can fuck holes in it.
can only
or
and then you can say let's go next next
see you again in the week. its better answer
bring.
right?
how is that valuable?
right? this is what i call complacency
ware
people don't know that they are being that.
ok? they think i'm putting in this
hours. look, i came at 8:00 in the morning.
i've been there at 9:00 in the morning.
it's been going on for six days. i am working hard.
but what are you doing inside that hard work
yes? you just go from meeting to meeting
you are speaking whole and that next week
next week next week all yours
in meetings today. let's see it next week
efforts are on to bring better answers.
the company made zero progress over the last
week. and the last month.
but you've been busy
bro. [laughter]
so how long before you give before you sack
them?
it's a very long process.
but this underperformance did not last for a month.
two months
six to 12 months.
being an underperformer for six months
will have to.
no, the conversation starts with 'look this is'
not working. let's try to fix it. so
then the company takes people along. we
it runs smoothly for 9 months.
observe for six months.
feedback conversation we are we are we are we are
team. it's not a boss that
relationship. it's a team relationship. everybody
is helping each other out to grow. i have
to become the boss that final day when that team
work stops happening.
but here's what i don't understand
that everyone comes together. 10-15 years
take your startup to ipo by working hard
let's go. then the ipo happens. publicly
is listed. everyone earns money. its
a very choice. one one some how at some point no
matter who you are become a family type feeling
it is said that this is it. we all busted
is. it's a shared mutual feeling.
i'm sure when you publicly traded
and many of your employees
money must have been made from e-shops. it's not
that you will feel it from inside, i have done it.
it's a very shared feeling. right? and
after that people move ahead with these people
take the company. it's very rare.
almost i've never heard of someone
of course they made it to the top and then that
the founder thinks that this guy is with me.
these are the ones, now i have become compliant.
i am observing those who saw me today
helped till now remove them and bring others
joe and hungary
there is no true thing that has ever helped me
i have helped them too, i have helped them a lot
we all did this as a team
absolutely yes there is no one os
anybody's anything's fair, everybody's got it
there's due of it
then yes, this is mine, not yours.
here
ok
we all got to a point okay now i am
actually responsible for this
organization to make sure that it's still
succids
ok and if somebody is not working
including myself okay i should be the one telling
calling yourself out deep you are being
toxic you should get out of here someone
i have told you that you will become an under performer now.
i have been there once or twice and
in which area
i mean that
strategic
decisions when pankaj was leaving right so i
minato was in a bad place like then
so what did people say that you can't do it?
will get
yes you should bring ceo
we
so went through that process
what was that place
i was like cool if that's what it takes
so i fired myself and then i thought.
i was very i have i think for three
years i was ready to be yaar mere se ceo
not going to happen. this is a very large
organization. what kind of things are you saying? chief
product officer is my game.
we
give it to make the product. take me take me
take it down. all this is not going to happen to me. so
give butt
we sort off
become a team where i'm just like ceo for
from the name
for the title but i'm generally the chief
product officer akshant is cfo
buy title but he runs all like investors
everything i don't even know them for the last
seven years so our even when we were
private the last to fund race he was done
just by him. i didn't even meet dose
fox. so we became a team which shared
responsibilities.
so we don't fit people in these titles
this is your title, so all this is yours.
will have to work. because this title speaks
that all this work happens. so the titles are
what they are but we fit roles to people
that you're good at these things. so let's
tailor a role for you right. so we are very
unstructured organization that even
today even today. did you genuinely try to
find a ceo or mg was mohit gupta
was brot in to be ceo?
and then people were like
don't give this a shock don't give the shock to this
why did the organization become a food delivery ceo?
give
because people like you they follow you so lets
not that leadership is changing
we
okay, let's become the ceo and create a group.
ceo should have made mg food delivery ceo.
are
we
and i was like cool food delivery most
the business anyway is food delivery
ceo i'm total group ceo but i'll late
i do the chief product officer from. i came to sleep
actually like follow him he lately
organization for like two three years and
then i learned from him on how to scale
and what did work
what did work with him?
even to let go
i think
i just came in terms of aggression in terms
of how we need to move forward beyond a
point versus place of where we dust
not even hunger i think hungary was not the
wasn't wasn't where hunger wasn't
where there was an issue the issue was more on
how do you manifest that hunger
he was like
we're at a good place in an organization
right now let me coach and grow leaders and
then that's how we will grow and i was
like yes and
we need to coach and grow but let's also
get things done
like but no i think long term it's better
for us to coach and grow and then let make
things happen i don't know we need to get
things done right i am now so and then we
will also coach and grow so i think just
this it was just a how of how do
things to do with absolute urgency
urgency and i was like and play
isn't he
we also have urgency, gun should never
go off your head as soon as take the gun of yours
head you're dead ironically [laughter]
even today you believe that
despite being such a big company, tell me top
three bad things
who likes
like three bad things about working at
zomato
three bad things about working at zomato.
and you can't tell that like i know i know
i can't even say good things and say them
bad things
or [laughter] don't do that
people do this a lot in interviews, right?
more [laughter]
is irritating
what are your weaknesses and what are your strengths?
wally strength [laughter]
bad things about working at zomato
so there is no there is like zero
structure
we
we don't have hierarchies
we don't have reporting managers we don't
have goals
we don't have
appraisals which are given to you that good
this much salary will become in so many years
what will you do in these years like
absolute nothing
we have this is what you're doing right now
nothing else
nothing else
this is very unsettling
we
this would have happened to me too if i was an employee.
so i don't call it good as a sugar coated bad
i am saying this is unsettling
this is so much chaos brother what to do
this is not chaos, this is inner chaos.
it does not come in organizational chaos
so this is your inner case. am i at the right
place? what is my career? will i grow
will i not grow like you don't have answers
two dose questions.
hum right? you have to trust and believe and
and then it happens.
so [laughter]
funnel
in boss, we trust, whatever happens remains to be seen.
not just in boss. like i'm not telling
doz peepal. but people are not even like them
don't even interact with me at the scale.
it's just the entire system is built like
that's right so they would talk to their manager
and their manager would tell them stories
we
i used to feel like that everything was
fine chill working karma's desire [laughter]
do fruitful work and do not wish for the fruit. like
no [laughter]
like so that mindset and mentality just
like it just like goes down like layer
ballier end
so if you're new
to be able to
if someone in an organization comes to an end
tells you to do your work and not to wish for a moment.
will be like what bulled [laughter]
give me my path than we say we are
not the mean to me path. this this like it is
comfort that you have. let's solve it. just
look around.
there are so many people who have been here for
years. i won't be looking we're happy.
you feel something in our life
is missing. is everything okay? be for you too
will go. i don't know how it will happen. to someone
don't even know? nobody knows. deepi
don't even know. even deepi doesn't know. on
it will be done. if you're good. life will happen
problem is a good problem we have so much
talent we
okay and this talent is very like used to
this way of working
we
without goals putting in their best effort
being like trusted without life's right
so operate in a high trust environment
we can't just like leave and go
somewhere else because they feel suffocation
that's why people come back to us
more is better. and several times in five years
they come, sometimes they come every 10 years. coming
are. people are coming back. because this is end
it's not because of me. it's because of the
culture right? and the culture is we trust you.
we're not going to inspector baji no
is going to happen. right? let's just talk about
the topic. get things moving. you do it at
your own pace. week
had to go. somebody falls it's cool. the
organization takes a pause on the work
stream sometime if somebody leaves and goes on
a break it moves everything up and down
this is this is a very good thing and people
don't want to leave so now we have talent
like ceo ceo quality talent
and now we like what we do with this
like we have to have cash in the bank we
have talent now have to think of new
businesses to do and these are like
incredible people have been here for a decade
and more right they don't even know anything
else
we
give no only this way to work
what else would be bad?
and what bad thing would happen it's our businesses are
weekend heavy
weekend heavy or holiday heavy 40%
binance on friday saturday sunday new
years ain't it a full time on war room no
holiday means hospitality business, right?
we
so we're not off on holidays
so we are
what do you tell your employees brother?
work on new year, work on diwali
this is the business
people do this while going to restaurants, right?
work so why would we take leave
so when they see you my friend my ceo
the founder is having a party on holi.
ceo founder holi
pay party
never lose never lose
we're in office we have to be there
you will celebrate holi on a different day and diwali on a different day.
do something back and forth on a different day.
do it or come and do it at 4:00 in the evening when
everybody can go home when the peak time is
overwrite so new year too late when
we do something we'll come back by 12:301 am
from office and it will be a quiet have a
drink together go to sleep right so new
here is not there is no party we
like we're here to make sure everybody
other parties happen that comes at a cost off
those hours will not happen [laughter]
so your new year's party is after 1:00
will start
and so this takes a toll on family right so
that yer family wants to do yes right so
and then you're like sorry but i have to be
well, that's part and parcel of zomato,
blinked, whatever we do?
what do you think about expensive talent
that if someone is very good then it may cost him dearly
if i have to bring it, i will bring it. even two business
doesn't make sense at this point?
what do i mean business doesn't make sense?
like there are times when
x roll
on an average let's market standard is ₹
you want a person worth lakhs but a month old.
ok? you said that rolent is for me.
i want to get a good guy. hmm.
and i am finding a good guy with rs 6-7 lakhs.
is. and your business can afford only 4 la.
would you push it to get
that person exceptional?
how do you test that?
you should know that. means you should
have intuition. meaning
intuition intuition is how business works.
if there was a formula than everyone
person who went through an mba would be able
to build a business.
so if you have intuition that this guy is exceptional
then i'd do it regardless of business
doesn't make sense.
why what's the philosophy behind it?
because ry comes.
that person is able to do more outcomes somewhere
some how things are up.
may be six months, 12 months later but that
will show.
i would never
overpay talent just because they want more money.
you know
well i'm job hopping. to me
100% race is required. no dumb chance. ok. i wood
always make sure that who ever is coming in
is being paid fairly compared to people
inside the organization. even if i had to
give them four times their current salary. right?
so i have to maintain fairness
inside the organization. and then i wood
but don't look for people who are just hopping
for the money. so if they're not hopping for the
money than i would pay but how do you decide?
promotion tell me this guy is earning x
now this should be 3x his salary.
because no one in the market is willing to give it 3x
ready for this usually employee wood comment
be like
we don't go 3x do we don't talk about
market
we
there is no market in zomato
is
nobody comes and says that man, i have this job
the offer has come, this has happened, this has happened, that has happened.
that conversation is not entertaining
if someone comes like this then go away.
you don't carry even if the talent is good.
no if the conversation has got to that
points where they care about discovering the
market we have failed.
hmm
to each other benchmark them to a higher one. ok, give
have already lost trust. ok? give
didn't feel like coming and telling us.
ok.
cool that man i'm not getting paid fairly.
which generally never happens. i think it's
mostly we failed. that we didn't recognize
that the person is doing better and we should give
give them a salary. we have already failed. so us
giving them a 2x salary at that time in
a negotiation is not going to build
trust. nothing is going to get solved.
things are going to get even worse. so
that's already a point of failure. so his
go later. so come on now, no one came like this.
someone came saying increase my salary now sir. so
in your head you're like this too much
he is an important person. what is a metric?
like how do you judge to grow that
the important people we know
they don't come to ask these questions.
they're already being rewarded rewarded
generally generally.
ok?
right?
from i wood
close to zero chances that they would be able
to find more someway
but then i am in such a big organization.
surely some high performers will remain
which you may not pay attention to
probably no one notices
but this sees the entire team is built like that
so it's not just me not giving in
everyone pay attention to each other
only those who would have ever come will be missed.
what is the way to promote is there
a formula that you put out?
no no everybody takes care of each other. so
this gets spread out.
so in whatever way you are probably in your top
you deal with 20 people and trickle
are down.
they will grow up here. give no the ethos of
how we pay.
so
so in the beginning how did you decide to pay?
just generally [laughter] i've always been
generous. like i was like that man good
you are asking for so much, take this much. cool work
do it now. we're not going to talk about money
ever. that's just focus on work.
yah.
actually it has a culture, isn't it? i am
what is that called forgetting? we
they fire people under
give a like to the performers, random test
it happens. do you know about it? there is
zappos. it's not from netflix. give ask
is it the one talking about that
i will give you 3x three months of salary
right now if you want to leave you can leave. no
question ask
tell me which one it is
he was the founder of zapus zap.
tony
he used to do it
and then whoever used to say that at that time on the
spot did interest, there was some income from netflix
am loosely reframing famously built on the
radical candor high performance and the keepers
managers must be willing to fight to keep
an employee if not then employee receives a
generous severance around four to nine months
off pay and give late
it's a performance based decision by the manager
will you fight to keep this keep di
keep this employee and the manager say no then
that fired
i know
do you like this taste, we don't play roadies.
[laughter]
you remember roadies
[laughter]
do you used to watch roadies?
or used to watch roadies
do like he used to like it? i mean at
that time there was nothing else to watch
we
that was entertainment
we
what did you like more, roadies and splits?
villa
splitsla came way after
i don't think that was the same era
so you didn't watch
i think stopped watching tv after i left
home but what do you like about roadies
because just mentioned rotis
i don't know like there was nothing thing
else to watch [laughter]
one thing which came out which i really
like roddy splitsla out of all his joe
title songs were like i really
used to wait for another season song i
i don't remember finishing any seasons.
have you seen anything i just used to wait for
that song ek agni ka song tha roadies
the song was i love them have you do you like
music
i like music but i don't remember it
had they had songs
do you watch movies now shows now very rarely
one somebody likes when two three people recommend
what decent recommendation did you like?
felt
i don't i never remember the names dude
tell me something that will be remembered on the plot
describe like an alien
there is this movie na where ah refience was
the pope am
he is not the pope.
the pope had died and they needed to replace
snow
i don't know that was nice that was one the
the ending was slightly disappointing the whole
the movie was good coming back to the conversation
where we will before we get into some stuff
tell me about swiggy
ok
what
favorite topic yes. [laughter]
that at one point he was far ahead of you guys
from. they were clearly more loved. what do you
think? what good were you guys doing
were not able to do it?
man i think food delivery logistics that
it was the last mile one. give actually
started it.
we
and i for a couple of years was resisting
it's thinking that this model can never make
money.
why?
economics were very off. we
so it was way hard to justify back then
that this would make money and i'm sure even
swiggy founder like he also didn't know
weather it weather it would make money but but the like
customer love was real
so at some point there was no choice but to do
it's for us even if we didn't know we would
make money ever so
and how did we know that customer love is very strong?
there was retention. yes, i was just getting to know the meaning.
when your own friends are saying man
i am not ordering any more from zomato
i will order from swiggy right then and there
inspite of the love if they do this then you know
that you have a problem at your hand
and then you wanted to just do this
then you've had to figure it out
and then swiggy recently had one condition
in the shark tank you will be eliminated as a shark
tank judge was a condition was it true? i
heard that from the shark tank team
that's why because i was there actually
talking to me for the next season and i
was like a weekend last time also one
weekend i could do it end
and this second time also i was like okay
i can do one weekend only
and then we still talking and then suddenly they
backed out and one day later they called us
listen we can't do this cool but why
[laughter]
like swiggy sponsored us then and give
like told us that
we can't have us they're cool get like a lot of
lots of cash out of them please [laughter]
felt bad
atlist make them pay know why it's cool
this is what you would have done if i were you
if it were me i wouldn't do this but i feel bad
i don't think it's fine
why don't we do such competition?
would promote. you are paying yourself, sponsor
if you are doing it then probably its founder
would have thrown it out. do this
i wouldn't have done it. why i think i
would be more graceful than that.
the sponsor also does. it's like come. no problem.
why? do you think this is the reason why you
would you like? or it's okay.
i mean it's a nice thing. why
why am i fighting?
don't need to
but is there something that makes you like this?
because many people give wood
let's cut that off. they'd do the same thing
which swiggy did.
i think this is a
this is a bit of a scarcity mindset.
correct. and
trying to like cut into a seemingly very
limited small pie i don't think it matters
like so
just doing the right thing continues growing
till sleep well [laughter] sleep with a
conscious what is more clear
conscious more than sleep well
we are doomed to not being able to sleep well butt
conscious should be clear my conscious wood
don't allow me to do that so, i would respect not
sponsor. then i wouldn't actually even
sponsor. i'd let it be. i was like,
ok, you're doing
do it. you have own this spot. you did well
you take it.
i do something else.
i'd i'd change my tough and then beat
commit. then try to negate something.
and the judge on shark tank helps a little
to become, to become a shark.
yes and no contact is specific, all this
some
which helps and which doesn't?
so i didn't so i'm generally not that person
if you know how to go to these things then it's not
my not my thing
right before shark tank may be for a year and
so, no?
i started meeting restaurant owners by
myself i never used to go do what i want to be
side off food delivery and annie and annie others
businesses and people used to be like you are a
decently okay nice guy why do we have
this kind of an image of you
we
i was like i don't know i may be because i
have always wanted to stay in the shadows
we
because i have this social anxiety i don't
want to talk you know so that it's branded
me as agent's kind of person so people
will like dude may be you should get out more
people will just understand and trust you
guys more so
than shark tank always used every year
to ask me aana hai aana hai aana hai some monday
it's like would i think this could be a nicer
quicker faster way for people to get to know
me because no one knows me
so i was like cool i'll do a weekend so
just three days of shoot and then that's it
should be enough
the cost that i paid for going to shark
the tank wasn't something i
expected what cost privacy totally
gone to the dogs
just i just like can't step out and go
to restaurants in india any more. so
why? because now people know
under the table privacy like it reels
just like
not cool
we do you do you do you get bored when like this
do you go in cars or sit in hotels
yes people make reels and post them
i don't get annoyed i just try to avoid
it's as much as i can
i don't get bored because i mean.
all of us are people humans will do
human things why should i
lose my peace over humans doing humans
things so like okay let it be
i mean it is what it is not not even
let it be right so it's like it is
it's like peace out trying not to get into
situation where this happens as much s
possible and that's it but you'd rather get
back to a situation where you are private
you are just living life.
i'd love that. i'd love going out
two restaurants,
chilling, opening my laptop, change of scene
i would love normal
unknown life.
why? [laughter]
you don't like publicly known like
celebrity public.
i never, i never stood up for that. and
that was not what i wanted for
myself.
why? i don't know.
it doesn't fit.
like there's only cost on the other side.
what's the upside?
i don't know. there's zero upside? there be some
upside. that's why people are mad towards
getting fame. i think the grass is always
greener on the other side of the fence.
we because they don't have it. so give feel like.
probably. so you said that's why you went
on shark tank because you thought it was a
business call.
business call will be a good platform. people
you will know more about brand recognition
will get it.
trust zomato more brand recognition there
was it was not a sales job
for me.
it was not about getting more orders.
we
it was about like ok trust
will increase. this is the person ok
so when we do something you can see okay this
is a person saying this so you look at it
from that lens rather than obviously
you must be lying, right, that means there
is this
there's this mindset right that's all
companies will bring bag boro steel for
profit and for money right so
and we're not dose people so we just do
things for what we think right and wrong but
we think is the right thing to do and become so
goes. we'll get to that. the right and the
wrong thing. we'll get to that. [laughter] butt
you also said that to people in shark tank
i thought you were an agent. so that's why you thought
it's a good way to show people who i really am
m. so if you go there then there will be something special like this.
you didn't show love. like you were i
remember the one thing which came out of the blue
the number with the proportion was that detail wrong.
wrote it. you got irritated. fact is fact
is. meaning
but then the thing is the purpose that you went there
for people should not feel that i
i am such an angry agent.
exactly think pointing out something
factual is common at all. agency is
i'm right in opinion vs opinion
you are wrong. take a cut.
have you ever done this in you think shark time?
this is how things work
and this is what i think, you can see
our own. i was like i feel like that
it is like that. i could be right or wrong and i
don't have any data right now to change my
like
point of view. so there for i don't want
to do this.
so it was never like that.
i am like this, i am not like this.
don't i expect my team to be liked
that's because things change.
and
why were you so angry at that detail?
something went wrong at short notice. it's just what
in you just wasn't teasing. it was
just disappointing
it's just like i have this like appreciation
for craft and art right ki
look at this much, friend. meaning
it's like you have to care. hmm
right you're here you're a national tv
you really don't care
that's just disappointing like this
culturally disappointing for me right so for
anybody like it why like
may be missed, scared in nervousness
keep things in mind poor guy
then why are you on national tv?
ok you spend 20 extra days you do one
damn good job at this ok ok
there is no excuse for getting dosed
kinds of things wrong
like once in a life time shot you're getting
if that's with your team members and your people
or i get i make it my team knows this okay
i make a typo on twitter and lindin and
if something goes wrong by mistake, please give it.
i'd be cursing myself for the next one
these days i don't get sympathy messages.
after sending the type, when [laughter] it's time
goes away
i hope you're kind i hope you're
what what [laughter]
what bothers you today is very angry
on which
just
like compliant medium criti like in
general
like it's not even like that good you are
you're that's that midker and you're not
if you are showing mid-carity then i am cool with that
because you are performing at your potential
yes. i'm that's amazing because everybody
should try to do that we
plus minus 10% of potential
play on
right
but when somebody's potential is 100 and they
are playing at 10
correct and they are chill about it and they
expect
life outcomes to happen to them like they were
playing at their 100
that just sees me like why entitlement
like the world owes nothing to you
the world owes nothing to me right so all of us
earn things by creating value for
others write so how much value you are
creating for others
do that thing first and then you will get everything.
will always come so that's your it
just disappoints me in general right so what
make you lose your cool because you are angry brother.
this may be like in personal life i think okay
for the last couple of years before you'll be okay
you weren't tell me before means di
things could irritate me
repeatedly done they would irritate me even more
from the same person
this is how you like it, this is how it is with your wife too.
he is like in your personal life that you know
that your wife some potential is late
100% and somewhere else, if she is at 50%
is operating that you would get pissed with her
also
absolutely she would also get pissed at
that she is also like you many
so many i think in a like relationship with you
rub off on each other and become the same kind of
a person over time writes so becomes the same
kind of a person i become more peaceful with
every she becomes more
being demanding [laughter]
and demanding not in a bad way but in a good way
they're right by demanding good things and i feel
if you really are
in a good relationship where you are like this
that this is the person i wanna make it work
with for ever whatever
there are only faces with him. sometimes you
you are demanding, sometimes she is demanding
is. and then you balance it out to each other.
ok. so let's talk about blinkit types.
you boat blinkit. everyone said that you are crazy
yes. stock 75 75%
[laughter] crashed down. right? what
what was in you? what was going on in your mind
i think we should take it.
i had never
personally
experienced a service which was as
addictive edge blinked. and then blinked a little
was. gropers we've tried and tried
tha quick commerce. we had invested
million infers in it first
infer and then we tried quick commerce in
store right next to us we do three
try opening stores near your homes
did and we're like this is crazy the
kind of convenience we're getting anything
that we run out of nothing to plan like
life it just likes becomes easy
right so end
the it was just
i knew this could become a business like. so
and people would love it well.
so again coming back to the point that i have
always did things for myself. i have never
really thought that good this this this makes
like business sense. no if this makes sense
for me if i like doing this only then i
will have the passion to drive it. otherwise i
won't have the passion to drive it. so
that's why like it just made sense. it it
just made sense. so how were you convinced
investors and everyone else when it looked
purely
week
idea said it was bogus na customer
cohorts: samples of two-three small stores
pay var insane
we
[laughter] so all the investors agreed to that.
like yes that's right
we're like ok we trust your gut go ahead
so someone must have said something which
there will be people with business sense
they're like this is irrational but if you want
to do this
go ahead we trust you and play like yours
neck on the line. so that means your neck on the
line. i was like done sir.
so 75% of the stock had crashed.
it was actually a mix of things. market
crash was also going on at that time.
was. they were not just blinkit.
so
and blinkit happened to be a company. grow
first happen to be a company. of someone who 15
was your friend since he was one year old.
closest friend, one of the closest
friends. right? his wife is one of yours
was a cofounder. we are the people who say this
that i bailed out and saved my friend.
give money, people said, what at all?
how would you respond to that look we were
objective in what we're doing
we were i was even at a point of asking
lb to leave because he wasn't the right leader
for the organization. so at our end we
new that we haven't done anything wrong.
we are not messing around. we are ours na
conscience is clear. and
because this is my friend's company. that na
is a feature. that is not a bug in the system.
[laughter]
right? because i know that i'm betting my
company on this future.
we
so i wouldn't bet this on any unknown
founder right. who i would not be able to
trust my life because here i am
saying bro. zomato's future is going to
be decided on this bet
we
so we have to make this work if it takes a
decade and to whatever i don't know i
are you in this conversation is not about
how much compensation will i give you?
will your 10 years be the best?
the best of five will be the nun of that was even a
conversation one this was an emotional
spiritual a sort of an agreement
not between us that we're going to go
to do this. this is like almost going to
war hand in hand. right? so
so you can't do this with anybody you don't
trust with your life.
there's never a conversation in your head
what will your friend's company optics look like?
is your conscience clear? the rest
optics will be seen. [laughter]
and it with head a billion dollars
valuation which you got it at like a
500 something million. on half. 700 something
something 750
so that discount was for you to save
the company was therefore
no man it wasn't a discount it was
as much as i remember i could be wrong
think the
valuation was decided to be a billion
and something but the stock x shop had been
decided that this percentage stock shop
will do but until that deal is done our
25% stock had fallen
okay so the news is the number is never the
o it was decided to be a billion only it
wasn't even decided to be a billion it
was basically decided to be that much
percentage of zomato
we
whatever that value is we look at made some
rational sense of it and then there was news
that aakriti has completed her 3 year compensation wave
had done. was that a part of the condition? u
no she waived three years of compensation right
that's just general habit of people at zomato
why
once they make money they just want to get into
this space that i want a serve i don't
i don't want to get paid
but 3 year compensation wave off stock
everyone has it, they don't like cash.
salaries wave off doesn't move the needle
that had nothing to do with this
and it was a condition that because
conflict of interest was not even a
part of these conversations we just kept
every out through and through she was even
oblivious to the fact that we're going to
do a deal
and once the deal happened it was a conversation
that may be a conflict of interest now.
if you see the figure you have to go now does two
guys are absolutely fro amo professionals
they don't talk about work at home. relationship
super solid, super strong. so i had
never had any inkling of this person
knows this this person knows this nothing
we mean different compartmentalized running
always was.
what do you think about zappo?
another comprator
[laughter]
beyond what you think
i mean quick commerce is interesting
dense high growth space
we
zepto is also
part of the
part of the few players i don't have much
to to
it doesn't matter
meaning
we don't think that they do their job at all.
are.
but you said somewhere that ₹00 crore burned
let's do it on the quarter. and aditya jo
zepto is the founder, he said it
verifiably untrue. where did i say
these something
i did not interview
this is a text, a newspaper interview
i had gone.
i didn't say that. that something
misinterpretation somewhere something happened and
it it it went like that there was some
confuse what you some confusion i don't
remember but i didn't say that
so
it was a big bus that you compete about
you are talking about ₹2500 crore quarter
these people spend a lot of money for
example i think it was something like
someone might have asked me ok you
do you know what his burn rate is?
as i knew it was 2500, i thought it wasn't.
part of the question that was asked for
me it was decided question so i told
gave mention and went there and
then and then i was like just like late
pass it
did you think that you made a mistake doing
what by saying these mistakes happen cool
learn from this move on
but it was a mistake you thought that in between
i probably shouldn't have said this
yes it's okay man you never know this thing
but this number was true i don't know
ok you just said it
no i mean as much as i knew true you never
never know the truth what is the truth? right? so
we all have our own versions of truth.
are there.
we you know aditya somewhere said that i was
five things zomato does when they start
it makes you feel strange that you are
competing with someone that young
i think how does it matter? meaning any difference
doesn't have to.
you met him?
yah.
you like him?
yes as many times i met him i have
actually like him what about him you
really like
i think smart guy talks well honest
wants to build the business
but or but but i haven't known him for the
last couple of years or like two years is
been i've met him i know the early
stage version of aditya i don't know the current
version of aditya
and people change quite a lot.
you think he must have changed?
i don't know. i have met him
but people do change quite a lot especially at
the stages.
or what changes in people usually?
i mean these are high learning pace of
learning is quite high isn't it?
on things. good and bad both. so i don't know
what's going on out there. butt,
and if he would change, if he didn't change
zapto won't even goten this far as well so
i'm sure it's learning and changing.
and what do you think zappo is doing right
just from a competitive lens. i don't know
friend.
so, there must be something you must be
tracking on competitors.
we don't.
nobody. don't you even pay on swiggy?
no.
but if from just a lens because you check
do you sometimes order from swig?
tasting the way you said it before you said it
last few years no end no jap test
never call
i think we've come down to our own ways off
doing things the right way.
but there's something you think if you
head to pick up one thing that zeepto is good at.
another thing swiggy does well
is. what would it be?
i think
svig is still a formidable food delivery
comparative for us. so
always tough to fight them they are
always. so 1 inch extra room for free
not found there. [laughter]
and
i accept i don't know
i think their marketing is quick and nice
but the zomato team runs it
they are all x zomato people.
everyone has learned from us [laughter] for them
do it do it make it simple when your people
you look somewhere else and somewhere else
they are doing a good job looking at them like this
think that
why did you leave from here or why did you leave?
are just like you get a little happy about
c we are the factory of creatives in
i feel happy and proud even if there is competition
if you are doing good work then i look and
like nice good job
never that shit they went that way
absolutely no meaning that's life that
happened so there's no such thing else anywhere
so let's go
so yes we went here ok
enough of your human things now let's talk
about what people call the inhumans
side in you i have side
or there's a lot there, brother [laughter]
so many i've had to cut it down that
you're talking in parts [laughter]
i will give you paper after this
see what's there
please
so in april 2025 500 to 600 employees
you fired
april 2025
customer support employees
ok
it is described as cold termination and
in human treatment his
this news was wrong
this news was wrong
or
slacks account randomly deactivated
access denied
this news was wrong
so where did this news come from and what?
this was about 20 people performance base
removed purely after months of feedback
and somebody went on dead it and posted this
drama end end
so 500-600 people were not expelled.
na but we just let it be these things
don't justify like screw it
but there was someone who was fired 28
nothing like that because of minute lateness
had that 28 minutes lateness happened, it wouldn't have been a day.
you are coming 28 minutes late every time 3
months from how does that work when you're on
a when you're actually on clock to clock
job
we write that's not cool or so over 3 months
he was late for exactly three months and 28 minutes.
is.
means something like that long three months
exactly pointed is written in it.
it means you are coming late every day.
is this cool?
i don't think it's cool, man.
but what difference does it make? you said culture is a
they that
this is a job which is customer care.
right? we can't have that.
we
capacity planning planning look at that
everything works. now you have the order
gone. you got trouble. there were no people. how
how does that work? summons are clock to clock.
there is capacity planning. if if we don't ask
this person who's 28 minutes late end
everybody starts being 28 minutes late.
for 28 minutes we have absolutely no
one on the job. how can we how can we like
accept that. and it's not like that
warnings have not been received. people just
abuse social media like when we just
let it be goes on.
what is ai karma?
ai karma is there any scoring
you guys have created a system called ai score.
will give people there is no ai karma
again credit
there is karma system
yes karma system
karma is a system but is not ai karma
basically
we know that these customers abuse customers
support quite a lot
we
so we have this karma score for them that man
this customers abuse
we
so we are careful with them.
people are not for employees.
not for employees. iron end
gold is not for employees. these are
all customers.
this is just customer segmentation. so its
not for any employee of customer support
it is not for anyone even for the employee.
people say that you feel zero problem in
firing randomly. that you guys just from 3
see you under performing for 6 months.
even if he has been working on something for years
perform kiya ho and then you fire them you
are like just leave
the tragedy of this statement is that the people
who are saying this they don't get the message
when we're telling them that this isn't
cool you need to change it meaning if them
would have understood that man listen let's 28 minutes
what are you talking about? listen, you are 28 minutes late.
it's coming, it's coming too late isn't it?
it will work because
president is setting everyone late.
if you start coming then the company will not work then you
please come on time. this conversation happened
is
we
no, i have not understood. now we have this conversation
if it has not happened and it has happened and it is understood
that's why that person hasn't come, even then 28 minutes
is coming late. so the tragedy of it all
this is when we ask people to leave even
inspiration of taking them through feedback loops
the reason why they're still there is because
they didn't get the feedback and understand and
change and sort of and like internalize the
feedback that has been given to them. so when
let's go back and tell him that it's done, friend.
what have i done on the team
[laughter]
brother come on
direct this leg there is always like that
meaning it's always no whenever you get to that
what i did at the point after months like
i only made you lie down for 28 minutes.
have told you many times that this is not going to happen
work this is not okay for these reasons
i don't think it's a big deal
but we think it's a big deal okay cool
you guys are like this like that like that i
will go
and then post on social media
somebody like this has called you you treat
people are disposable as long as they are useful.
ok fuck the day it's a little bad
i think that's people's own issues why they
say these things we don't we don't
like do that at all
and
something [laughter]
like in human side, which one is first?
ok this one is cool bring them on like this
[laughter] it's a lot of things, man.
but you are like this
people write a lot that you drive away like this.
you tell people that you
work overtime work hard work more
if you work obsessively, you will grow.
and then we will work hard for a long time
and the overs also go like this, above and beyond.
and then suddenly all our work is over
fired
deepinder specific words were deepinder
promised us that if you work hard you will
grow in the company and then my slack was
deactivated randomly as if i'm somebody
disposable
i don't think it never happens people are
making up things out of recipes
just because they can do it bother you
hurts because we never did these things but
then well like ok yaar meaning
people on ishz
do you ever send notice-votes?
no
not you're defaming and doing this
not worth fighting not
let's talk about gig workers okay you
how many people do you employ?
every month basis delivery workers
cross zomato blinket
everything
7 lakh monthly active
how many people are fired every month?
how many people are hired every month?
there is no fire
you must not be leaving me or you yourself will be on fire here.
there are few fires
no you don't want to be a bad actor
termination someone
terminations happen, terminations are not ours.
all are temporary anyway.
there is no permanent termination and warning
systems are there also first of all
will give a warning bro listen there is a
like coach and educate period first keep
listen this is not cool. you're new to this.
but not delivering the order and thinking that
you can have this order. it's not cool.
they eat it by taking it out in between.
it's just like they don't know that it's
not ok.
we
like and we are like, well don't do this.
oh ok, i shouldn't have done this. cool no further
will do. and then don't do it. not 90%
will do.
like it's just like that's right so it's
like
you know funny thing let me actually take a
step back
this is like many years ago z in zomato
na wee
found a sales person found a sales person
we are there and at that time we are not in the systems.
you could have reduced the restaurant's commission.
anyone from the sales team at your discretion
used to be able to like. used to be able to like. used to be up and down.
so
we learned that someone had stolen personal cash.
we have accepted
and the commission of a restaurant should be increased from 15 to 10%.
gave
the sales person
we we
took personal cash himself
we
and came in our exception list that
ok this has reduced
we
while it's okay to some support and do
but we need to know why
we
right end and the person didn't have any good
answer.
yes.
ok? and then we smelt something fish.
we then went to the restaurant owner and said,
ok this is your commission 15 to 10 we understand
i couldn't figure out what happened. you sales
even the manager is not able to explain to you
and
what happened? and that person told us di
restaurant manager owner's friend gave rs 15,000
took from me.
so now this is where the story starts.
this was just the background of the story.
so i am bored and like that friend of yours
salary is rs 45,000.
we we
why are you doing this for 15,000?
yes we
meaning ethics conscience
something happens. meaning what's going on?
is there some pressure at home?
there are some medical issues. nothing falls good.
ok.
and
no, everything is clear. so why this
have done? it's like you know the response i
gate. what's wrong with it?
everything exactly. yes? and you will
not
it's you won't like believe me every time
we have come across and like 99% of the times
whenever we come across this petty stupid
fraud
the question that is asked back to us
is wrong.
really
ok
my father also used to do the same but
and then it hit me corruption travels through the
family
okay this is how you're brought up
okay so people justify to themselves
to live with themselves that's okay
okay and that's how it was
happening inside our own organization.
and then we had to do ethics classes.
after that things got better
after that things got better but i don't understand
in people. ethics is a very hard
concept to teach explain.
because i have seen this all around since childhood.
let's do it.
we we
so it's like that's how it happens. this is
ok right? what is wrong in this?
and i was like i grabbed the head
how can i even answer this question
what is wrong in this? like obviously wrong
is.
so how many such cases are there where
these people feel that little money
take it out from the side.
don't know i don't know right now how much would it have been
is. it may not happen now. right now the systems
it's very electronic and tight right now.
these are things that happened many years ago.
butt you terminate like you do so many
you must be terminating people every month?
now these are the zomato riders who are
delivery partners all of them
you can say
you terminate the month at rs 5000.
we out 7 and 1 lacks.
and how many do you hire every month? add how much
are there in the system?
1.52 lakhs
1.52 lakhs are being added every month.
and out of that around 5000 people
we terminate 5 lakhs. one and a half two
lakh himself goes.
leave one and a half to two lakh rupees every month.
yes.
what are the reasons? in exit interview
did you find out anywhere?
it was a temporary job.
earlier he was working as a driver.
came in the middle. in doing this thing and this thing
it took place. so there's a lot of transients
population. most of it is transient. 2
worked like that for three months
the factory is somewhere, it is closed in winters.
if so, we will come to the city and work, right?
there's like that it's actually purely
gig
and there will be like 20% of the base which
there's sort of things like it a more
permanent long term stable thing but 80%
is gig
come and go
come and go and work part time
when part time money is made then
don't do it later when money is needed
come back right right. so its
it's very we have predictability
only to a certain extent that how many today
will people come?
we
we don't have anything beyond that.
predictability.
and why do you terminate 5000 people?
what are the top three reasons?
multiple reasons for fraud.
what are the basic frauds? top two
tell me three.
the top three frauds are that the food is half
delivered food not delivered. delivered
marked to tell the customer that yes
but food not delivered cases after picking up the food
are there.
a
your ₹ 400 from lets in cash on delivery
there is a bill. you have only ₹1000. if there is a note
you give a ₹1000 note and say that to your friend
give. he says yes, i will bring change in it.
i give
from below
from below and then they don't show up
ok so this is where the customer karma is
score and the rider karma score sort of
blends in
and we can't and we can never be fully
right
yes
ok here we say ok if a customer has a
reputation which is good
we
and they complain about such a thing then
wood most likely to be right
who knows what is true in this?
nobody knows i'll ask that yes customer could
be right rider could be right sir i am
he didn't do this to me so he only gave ₹00
i am telling you this because
they want 600 bugs out of you okay now we
get stuck in this we don't know who is right
okay so here's where our karma systems are
work if the riders' customer reputation
reputation is better than what we tell the customer
sorry this is on you
the customers reputation riders reputation
ryder you're sorry the end we don't know [laughter]
50 70% on the times we take the hit
we
we will refund ₹600 to the rider.
will also say let it go man right but when
when the mismatch is just very stark that
when you punish the same rider twice
let's go on the same thing when after that
this is the third time this same issue has happened.
ishu has come with you. this is a pattern.
look at us
ok? this is not a coincidence.
pure play pattern.
yes. i let you go the first two times
so if you did it the third time then it's confirmed.
there is a pattern.
so then third time we terminate them.
what fraud do end customers commit?
do customers commit fraud? there is
insane fraud man. this
kept my hair out. in my food
hair came. return the money. return the money.
nowadays, ai generated images are
so anything
so we are showing it by putting lizard etc.
like people are showing off by putting lizard animal
that came out of
lizards don't do this, people don't do that much
roast like a fly
means some insect, some hair, some foreign.
object like a nail
we
okay the things
like now days ai has even made it easier to
convert but you're fully ok cake in a
smash smush cake s well [laughter]
my cake got smashed like suddenly 5%
how did the cake smash incident [laughter] happen?
gone friend
so how do you know who is telling the truth?
who lies karma score pure there is
almost no way to determine
so i'll give you situation
so tell me what happened to me in this
ebit zomato customer in situation
ok
so i order a lot and i am the company
i do it from the account. there is that by the
those one of the best features just want to say
that's because i don't have to pay
over and over again. its
my ea locked that for me and i'm like
i bless him every time. that [laughter]
not giving otp. i have likes on my phone
no. meaning i do not have upi. so
it's just a great blessing. ok. so now
so i ordered and i ordered a lot. ever one
sometimes bad things happen twice, something happens.
is. so i'm like i don't have that much time
what to concentrate on, why to concentrate and let it go
b. one day like at 2 am i was like mad
tired and no sleep. maybe 26 27 hours
no, he was not sleeping. and and i ordered and
i waited, it was open at one place.
and something went wrong from there. we and one thing
was missing. and then i came and then i
vaz pizza. so i called zomato customer care
but he said that brother, this is my missing. we
so reply me sir sorry in this case
we can't refund kuch kuch ok
and something said i can't do anything
about it because it shows that it will be delivered
nicely & staff. i said no
has not happened. and then i think two minutes later
they said sorry we can't help this is
it.
and i am bad but brother i am very good
i am a customer and i order a lot from the entire company.
if it does, then the company account is not even that
chhota will be my personal account
and then i rot guys i'm a regular
zomato customer you can go check my history
i wanna do stuff like this
this was sent within 2 minutes sir your refund is
ok we are doing it in 8 to 10 days
will you want in zomato and something
now this is human error
ok now that's in the night customer care
person is busy on their insta
[laughter]
ok cool
default is seno
ok
they don't even look at the right
side of the screen
where karma
where it is written that this is a good friend
customer
we
just sorry
ok
it's just like that human error so ours
business is likely prone to errors
we
there is perfection so impossible so like
i was wondering what happened? like just just
immediately that person just said something
must not have changed.
when i said this he just opened his mouth like this
wouldn't have done it. it's all written
all decisions on dashboard.
we
ok? and but we don't automate this to the
like extend that ai can do this
because like
we haven't got his confidence yet.
[laughter]
and i have a technical question. but your
and not just your like india's joe
swiggy zomato has great customer care.
us's contribution to uber eats is good
i agree
like it's i was in austin recently 10
times better than
it's much better why
i think zomato swiggy are the best food
delivery apps in the world
even better than uber itself
in us 10 times more
so why is there custom like there?
customer service sucks like customer support
was if i just had to compare apple too
apple is the worst of the two
experience
go to interesting technicals
yes yes tell me
so uber eats and dorsh neither that nor theirs.
are sitting with restaurants.
we
so the market is fragmented. this restaurant door
dash has it. these restaurants are available on ubers
are nearby. if you order from this restaurant
if you have to do it, you will do it near dosh. we
would you like to order from this restaurant?
we
that whole system runs like a monopoly.
all of
ok
two
different cards out, their own monopoly
because the restaurant is your choice
man, this is what i want to eat from.
ok
then again
so that's why it becomes complexity, isn't it?
don't compete, truly don't compete
that
we
we are not like this in india
swiggy is available in most of the restaurants.
i too am the same.
there will be only a few
meaning big handful meaning rare
right
and nowadays i also have a restaurant
he is coming, isn't he? exclusive, he has to come.
you have a little
give me a good deal, give me a good deal, i
i say sir, why are you losing your business?
[laughter] i mean let me be honest with you right
so i'm just telling you don't do this
please list on both because business from both
will come. why are you working with one? we
so i send all of us back, my friend.
we don't want to do this because we want
to be good partners for you. right? so if
if we do this your business will collapse. we
you will be stressed. you stress us
will you pass? we already have
stress. by giving you a good deal this is
going to tank.
ok? so this is not going to work. so if you
paying me more money
so the matter is different.
so the matter is different. if you are exclusive today or
if i can give you more business then i will talk to you.
is different. this is not going to happen.
we
ok? so do one thing and stay on both. this
is the best thing for you. so this makes the
competition is very intense in terms of
doing the best jobs that we can.
so end
lucky for both of us and it's not intense
to a point where we're doing the wrong
things to bring each other down
we
so it means bad competition is not healthy.
intense right so which makes us keep nudging
better and better and better
fair so you're saying that uber eats there
he is more loyal to the restaurant and
you guys are more loyal towards customers
and that's why the difference is
customer support
no that's it
you have you have a true choice in india that
if i don't i can go to the city
you don't have true choices there
so that's why they pay more on customer support.
they don't pay much attention to many things.
on
and coming back to gig workers
you said it would be around 5000.
are people
there was an incident in telangana i will
read it as it is for you that telangana gig
workers union said that you have spent 700 crores
invested in any future foundation
so the situation of gig workers is better than that.
all their situation and their living
they have minimum wages and they would have increased them.
had the conditions been good, it would have been less than rs 700 crore.
but still you did pr stunt rather
then helping people what do you think
about that
so look i have a problem with
distributing money for free
okay because it doesn't last us
i'd rather use the money to create systems
which can generate more wealth and
long term beneficial for people.
so this argument is that instead of 700 crores this
it just doesn't make sense.
ok
i mean, then it's okay, no company should make it.
profit also means
keep doing charity only. right? that's not
how life works.
life works when profit gets
investing
invested in other systems and businesses
which creates even more employment even more
wealth.
ok. so now to come back to that yer gig
would have improved the conditions of the workers.
i think that this argument is a david
versus golayat pr argument.
okay it's just very easy to pull us down
ok we pay well we pay way more than the minimum
wedges okay cool there are so many
unorganized and even organized
sectors which float losses and pay less
we
give me an example
most of our most of the people who late
complain about on twitter and ina saying that
friend
you don't pay
you don't pay you
exploit you pay less. you should pay
more to your riders. i was like you
how much do you pay the driver?
you tell me this thing first. you made your
how much money do you pay? this is yours
the drivers are yours and the maids and gardeners are yours.
and this is everyone. who leave your jobs
are doing this work. why? give because
find this job to be better than what they give
use to do.
okay they left something they didn't find
dignified enough and dose businesses also
own by people
we
people like us and you, whom you left behind and came here
are they
ok they have respite here
he has financial independence
they have freedom here but not to the
point off that yes that
take the car or do whatever
will find. but they can atleast have the
security of feeding their kids well.
right? they can send their kids to school.
ok? they didn't even have that before
man, i am constantly taking care of my children.
will i be able to pay for school education or not?
i will be able to do it. what we've done is made sure
that these people don't worry about that. give r
always able to continuously send their kids
to school. so we're just so short sighted
when we think of not paying them.
first of all, they are giving a lot. ok? v
can only pay that much. right? beyond that
economics don't work. business also has
to work. the business has to make money
able to do more things.
we
otherwise the system just stops here.
fair.
right? and the and the people over the next
25 30 years their children great things
will do. the opportunity we create
they are doing it, they are not doing it for them. their
this is happening only for the children. right? like
my dad didn't think of what to do? hee
was like let me just make the bear like
minimum amount of money to be able to send
my kids to school.
then i did that and then i did what i did
over the na over generations
the country changes. one in a generation
does not change over the years. we are saying this
that millions of people are their generational
will change the future. right? and i don't
think there's any other company which has done
that in india ever so far. right? so end
i don't understand the flag that we get
for it. where we are the only company which
has created so many jobs. so many
jobs. tell me any other company which has
been able to do that.
how much do you pay on an average? 7.5 lakh gig
are workers.
if delivery boys are around 7.5 lakhs then
how much does he earn monthly?
if you think that from late i can do regular hours
do it. if i work for six days, 8 to 10
hours a day becomes a plus of rs 25000.
and from people that you exploit them. why
do they say so there?
i'll tell you my theory on this.
yes.
why do people say you exploit?
yes?
we are not zomato swiggy we created a
a very peculiar social phenomenon has come here.
ours.
so there is this rich class. we
ok moneyed class
we
i am actually never
working class or
i didn't face to face with the less moneyed class.
it is not available in india
ok
has never come
we
yes sure we would have a driver
yes we have a maid ok one
there is a nanny
but neither we them nor they as an outside in
our people don't see the working class.
are. we think we should take care of them
are there only. correct.
but this is the first time that man we grow
we got these two classes face to face.
hum right? so now the reality of india
has become visible.
and people think we made this
reality. no, we have not made this. this
actually you are india's reality better
you are watching the version because of us. we
ok? you are delusional here.
people think this is a bad one.
it was worse before. this by fixing that
is made.
but we never saw that. we are oblivious.
what is actually happening to those things?
how much poverty is there? how does it look like?
we don't know these things.
true
it's a 10x upgrade for
the fox.
they are able to send their kids to school.
or
ok?
and then but this is the first time our moneyed
class just came to came came face to face with
the reality of the country. and then they are
like wow this is so bad. the guys
explain no we are becoming a generation
of people to educate their children to have a
better future which would have otherwise not
been possible
there are no jobs out there
but people than say that you don't even create
good conditions for them too
we have shelters we have shelters we treat
pay them nicely we pay them on time
we pay them we pay them fairly we have we give
can they switch off whenever they want to switch
off they can switch back on whenever they want
to switch back what kind of conditions
they say social security is not there but we are.
we give, we insure everything.
we provide
all the benefits that are in social security
are spoken. we would do it ourselves privately
they have rights because we care
ok accident insurance health
insurance blah blah blah all of two things
we do ok probably and we like
admin them so well
c recently n mp said
that in parliament should be closed 10
minute delivery due to death of riders
it is happening with extreme pressure that
they have to be delivered in 10 minutes. that red
running away by breaking the lights. follow rules
are not doing. and then that one constant
living under pressure and stress. whose
cause they're losing their life, late
losing their mind and they are exploited
have been. don't you think it's true? i don't
think so. why? first of all our
whatever our delivery partners are
no rider in blinked zomato
no timeline ever goes by that you have so many
have dinner there till 10 o'clock.
does not provide a 10 minute timer.
not at all.
not even in blinkit. not even in linked
is. we understood this and sorted it out.
you are almost in give up mode, man!
10 minutes is not enabled through us asking
people to drive fast.
10 minutes is enabled by density of
stores. they're just so close to you. ok?
delhi ncr has about 400 plus stores
blinket stores. that means there is her
there is a store in the corner. ok? so there
our packing time from 1 minute 40 seconds
is average.
ok? so a 1 km. come in 8 minutes
will the man go? he needs to be driven faster.
there is a little for that.
so there is no human pressure being
created to make this work.
but the timer shows me that in 6 minutes
will come. 7
he is visible only to you.
delivery boy can't see that 7 minutes
told that the customer will have to deliver that much amount.
everyboy doesn't know how many times he said it.
has gone. after that comes the job, man!
go and leave. he leaves and comes back
goes. that's it. it's a shuffling job
have no pressure on timing. when the when
they get very very late then we call them.
listen are you ok?
what's happening? do this na? than v
figure out if something is wrong we help them.
other times they are chilling having a
smoke and then listen later, friend
please leave it there and give advice, have zero.
time pressure
but there must be such pressure that in a day
15 deliveries have to be made because so much money
i will make it
those goals are not comfortable
it's not a matter of pressure
minimum 10% money is earned on every delivery.
or if you have to do 12 then money will be made
only i make money on every delivery.
i am a delivery boy, i decide.
delivering and i speak after one
today it's mine, so i got the money for one.
will get it.
you will get money for one.
it is not that you have to pay minimum.
people come every hour to work.
students come. students what give
do is that there on a bike.
ok? if you are coming home late from school
he will come back placing two orders.
[laughter]
how sweet extra pocket money i got a
i got an email yesterday from a
someone says he has joined the team.
we
hamari abhi na zomato ki ende hi sed sir char
sal was a rider, you supported education.
today i joined the design team of zomato.
was like cool shit man
on
see there's that happening but red light jump
are doing
good
have you heard that only zomato is available in india?
have riders seen the red light jump?
while killing or you also killed the world in general
have you seen everyone jumping the red light?
do it right
this is a type of sport in india.
is there support?
so even if he is not wearing zomato t-shirt
it must have been a human or a blinkt key.
i'm guaranteed to do that even then
red drag jump
because that thing is in our human nature
to do.
if it's just joe and blinkit
riders are doing this in india right?
then i'd take the blame.
we
but why are we taking the blame when all
of us who are not even actually employed
by us i don't even have time pressure. give
are still jumping
flights.
all the people in their cars are doing anything.
why are someone jumping?
they have little time pressure
got a gun no but it's sport
so i don't know why we get pulled
down for the things
what do you think according to you kya
where can the condition be improved?
it's useless for a delivery boy right now.
one thing me
it hurts us a little dangerously
there are no
cities
delivery boys don't actually complain about
it's much because they are from these areas and
they understand the vibe but something is unsafe
are areas. like
they just like get rubbed.
meaning, four people will stop you while walking on the road. their
will steal food and kill them types
like there is that rowdism in some areas
now customers live there
we
what do we do
so what do these we're like do with them?
okay friend, take optane etc. from this man.
let's see if you want to go or not
if you go, they say yes, if you live then
some people also share, they are also
people like that i'm not going to run away
from this i will go because at some point you
need to fight the crime.
but let me tell you, look at all this
there are possibilities. red zone
that there is a little problem here. there is a red zone.
you think carefully
everyone knows it happens. the word spreads
but that red zone delivery
do you get extra money?
see you. let's meet at night.
and what are the chances?
nothing like this happens in them during the day.
what will be the percentage? how many out of 100
of deliveries?
there would be 1000 cases a day. like this
now what will be the daily deliveries? let's put
that's in context.
in those red zones
25 300
decent numbers in volume
meaning
so it's like a gang is formed, isn't it?
people hold
yes that's what we do
to steal the food.
yes.
give local support there
then we try to do local police. like
there's a lot of work on the ground to be
able to
something happens in this
sometimes
there may be problems in your offices too
is. do you have a head of security or something?
something sincere?
why why would our offices have
problem?
that there are so many people every day now a days
you terminate, you don't terminate anyone.
you send 5000 people. 50 30 50 60 aa
went.
what has come?
to vandalize the office.
why?
it happens with no broker. remember.
why?
will come.
terminated. people gave that reason a little
to sabotage you. i heard uber for the
longest time in india, they were hiding
there.
so sometimes it happens people look terminate
those who are not people also know that they are
guilty
we
they create trouble, they don't commit crime.
so
what type of trouble does it create?
by gathering 20 more people that today
i will not allow work to be done locally here.
and all this but we have been able to now
manage it
manage and be pleasant with everybody and
get on good terms because of people first
don't know how this business also works. now
everybody is learning that this is fair.
this is how it works. and we also learn our like
systems are weak now they become better. so
there were flops where they were unfair.
terminations used to happen earlier. three times now
occurs after. right? so dose systems
become better. so there was a situation scene and
scenario i think
has it happened once or multiple times?
death of a delivery boy while making a delivery
he died at that time. why
and what happened?
man these are
these are
road accidents.
we
and as unfortunate as they are and we
support the families and we do all the work.
they're just mishaps basically
so i am from indore and happened in indore
was once
so
what did you do after that
we would have insurance
no how do you investigate that?
what happened to reason was it just purely
an accident
they're all pure accidents what happens
if someone dies what is the
protocol what is the policy of company
there's an insurance and then we also
like there is a team which reaches out to
the family understands the situation
what is it and how many dependents are there?
there is no when depending on that
situation will tune up and down so when
sometimes we extend job offers to families
depends on the situation. if there was a
child, there was nobody else earning wood
sponsor the child's education for long
term and so on. very case to case tailor.
chalta hai and kuch aise we look there is no
what we can solve for the impact of a
loss of a family member. but we try
to cushion the long term impact of that.
but do you pay the family? some
do you give remuneration? yes do jo insurance
it's money and family money
how much would be the insurance
this i think is 10 lakhs if not more last
time i knew it was 10 lax
minimum is 10 lux
minimum is 10 lux
do you know personal names of people who died
i don't want to take these names but
i know three four people i know families sum of
dose
couple of two kids i'm actually
personally funding them
so this is a very touchy topic for all of us.
all of us
we know the hidden cost of the entire thing.
feels guilty. not guilty.
feel sad. guilt is not guilt. meaning
it's just like we go to work too
anything can happen. so gilt wali
it doesn't matter. because we know that we are friends
also creating lots of good. so there is a
lots of there are lots of lives being saved
while we do what we do
but this is the cost that we pay for it. so
we just try to
soften it as much as we can. there was there
was a political leader in the country who said
that this is not innovation. of our india
what are the companies doing? in deep tech
we should go ahead in technology. us
that startup should be created. that this
are you a startup through delivery boys?
are you getting it done? what is there in this? how do you
think about that? when we talk about a lot
off
second time founders
who have created money who have been able to
create wealth
a lot of
kids off
rich founders
we
who have and could take more risks. we
i think they could take more risks
they could have done more
a we didn't have the privilege of o i have
capital let me see what should i do right we
are like that friend we started off with one
i create new scanning company
₹ lakhs will be made, ok someone's job
won't have to
that was our starting point
and then we just survive and build this
and what we did for us we are not the people
to be targeted here right so and if i do
a second startup and a third startup
i'd do deep tech i'd do crazy deep tech
we
right because it'll be fun
we
i'd have the risk appetite to do it i
am already doing deep tech startups right
so
and at the time when he made the comment
the minister made the comment i was already doing
the things. so i was like it's cool it's
okay let's continue doing our job.
i will tell you that i do
i will not tell. i don't care about anyone
tell. i have to do my work. so i am
look we've been talking about allegations
for so long.
we just get so much i mean it's just like
sometimes tired of too or there's another
allegation's ₹ lakh chief of staff position
there [laughter]
the allegation is that you
excluded by keeping this condition and this
kept for elitist people whose ₹ 20
only he can join to spend lakhs
is. this is a very latest way of
finding talent. so this one is not a trick.
i didn't want to play for 5 years
i had the idea for this thing
we
okay friend, i have to do this sometime.
and i was like this thing on this thing
my personal reputation has improved by doing
i will get hit.
we
so i have to do it. where the reputation is
at a point which is enough to take that hit.
[laughter]
ok.
so [laughter]
and the idea was that
i wanted people who could see through what i
am saying
we
i could see through that he is bullshitting
we
okay, and he's not looking for people like that.
actually won't ask for 20 lakhs like that
doesn't make sense but there's a point to this
chat what's a point to this chat learners
i don't care about money while i give
will still get the cash
right. so and we got 17,000 of these people.
our recruitment pipeline is still the same
interview application is going on from the bank
is.
it must have been one and a half years. i think one and
half years have passed. one year's time has passed.
so purpose all i knew it was this
to be a pr stunt.
to be a not a pr stunt.
it wasn't for pr. i actually
genuinely wanted applications
someone good, we hired so many people.
i am saying that all the hiring has been done since then till today.
coming through the same pipeline
took 20 lakhs from someone
we pay we pay people 20 not taken from anyone
lac was not the point [laughter]
but so it was just to segregate the money
minded versus the learning once that's just that
our filtration system was not very solid
on the other hand, how many people would have written this also?
sir i am very talented but i have
there is no money. absolutely. amazing and they are
also considered for the job even.
absolutely. who became the chief staff?
am actually a people
put money first na we didn't call them.
[laughter]
because that's not the point. then you missed the
message. then you're buying a job. this is not
about buying a job. this was something else.
like so extremes on both sides
we filtered out. so in between
those left at the people center are the people we
wanted
fair
there like i think that month itself we
hired 18 people almost everybody we give
them 50% raise on top of what they were making
because that's a fair salary at zomato right
just who became cos after that we don't
have achu cos
well, then that position for which
it was designed to create applications
[laughter]
you didn't have cos no one do you think
cos isent position?
man cos can go very wrong.
it's a very dangerous position to get into
right. it's a very tricky one.
why? it happens to many people. that na
he is a deputy ceo type role. ok?
and
so that person has to be very clear that
they're not the ceo. right? so and that
the boundary is very very very blurry too
manage
and it blurs out from then
yes
you think
yes and and then you are like communication with
the team sort of
like cos said something and gave an end to the team
forgot to mention that this is his own point
is off view. this is not mine. and the team
thinks it's my point of view and too
months later i found out but i never said
that and then that shit that person told that
to me you assume i said that yes we assume
but it's fair for you to assume so just it's
a mess
the first cos was the first to learn by hiring.
ever
thought you this lesson
yes
we
but things never went very very bad butt
i just like figured out quite quickly at first
that this whole situation is doomed to fail.
fair fair end
there's one last thing i was asking and then
we go to temple and continue and let
doing aerospace and bunch of deep tech jobs
ho right is there was a point where zomato
in you were expanding in nine different
countries all shut down, one in us
bought startup for 50 million then 50 million
got it done and then stopped it for 5 months
inside the
what do you understand about
expanding globally and at what time?
should and why should one do or not
when should i stop i wanna get yours
like just your opinion on that
i think back than when we started
international expansion in 2012
hmm v
never thought india would become this larger
market ok ok. so i came from india haze
positively surprised us surprised us
with the size and the place of growth. so first
we felt that there is more business in india.
will not become big.
ok?
have to do it.
we
will go out. will go out.
it is not made in india.
and will create a global company. complete ghost rider
was there there
and in that ghost we failed to realize
really good, this is our business
why and how is this happening in india?
other markets different from india
we
we thought the restaurant was running in india.
we want to find people, we will find them anywhere.
copy paste but it didn't work there
those who will not move in var knows markets
ok
to the point that india's success
did not come in the market. ok? failed too
not much but india wala
success also did not come anywhere. arrived in dubai
was. one or two had come to the philippines. like
and so on so on but like most places we
the media remained. and
in any business and any expansion na medium
is the toughest place to be in
when you get stuck in the medium. either we or you
break it or you go home, go home
get shut up ok when you in the middle
you are getting stuck, you don't even know how to stop it
or should i not yes agri ok like what
have to do this
terrible place to be in okay so [laughter] v
got stuck there in so many of these
markets and they are like and fight
it's an even cost fallacy and on top of that it's a friend.
okay, so much money has been spent, a little more
we have told this story to everyone
our culture is one of international expansion
paint the map red on our posters
has been installed. right? so how do we go back
from this one? no we can't go do more
peacock. so
then the food delivery battle in india
started
we
and then i was like okay we need money and
people to go here.
so that's when we like okay all like off
do it all. brother if like and i was my ration
was if i lose home
we
there is no global
we
home market is sacrosanct.
we have to protect.
yes
no matter what
true
that's fine
now i have grown so much, now dubai means uae.
and why not the philippines in these markets
go away
india is a big market so much to do
here friend
let's go bigger and go places
now food delivery is available everywhere.
business
let's go to school
[laughter]
something happened which you are not telling
because of which the government may fail.
will be different like uae is very close if
if you work, this will happen
just india is massive like blinkit is i
think zomato blinkit they are actually
early stage businesses it will look like i
am bull trying to like bull it u but give
are early stage businesses like indian
still eat out four times per month
we
compare compare to singapore which is 50
times a month the us which is 25 times a
month and even more some like it's crazy
numbers so journey off
avoiding home cooked food is just starting
right now and it will grow massively.
will kill. and i don't want to lose this. i
don't want to like get sort of
distracted with something else and say that
man, this opportunity was missed. this is
our hour to lose is not even our hour to win. you know so
but now you are getting distracted like this.
distracted in this [laughter]
what am i getting distracted by?
early stage not early stage food delivery
if you have a business
and now zomato blinkt is all in early stage.
will become very big. don't distract
are you staying? they are also entering aerospace.
you are also doing research on continuity. temple
you are also driving.
so first of all i am not doing anything.
you are trying to run. you are entering
yes in some.
ceo, i am not anywhere.
i am not a ceo in any business.
not in zomato
i am the group ceo. i am not a ceo.
ok.
so he is also the ceo of zomato. blinked also
is the ceo. there are ceos for every like
business.
ok?
so i don't have a full hands on
executive role in any organization.
ok?
ok?
so no on temple, no on continuation, no.
no friend. continue the research. it's a geek
out hobby right thing. so it's like a
mission for humanity thing is what i am
this just happened to me. it's not even like
that's what i wanted to do.
and it was my duty to take it to it
sudden point.
so he continues his work.
like two hours a month.
we temple we have ceo
let's have ceo. be smart blinked. so
my job is to work with ceos
we
and coach them and work with them to grow these
organizations. so that's what i'm not
loaded. still yaar like this
investors don't ask these questions, man!
your focus is going from eternal to eternal
is. now if you do all these things then maybe
will lose some trust on you now that you
you have got carried away on things.
don't ask directly. butt if that
even if you are asking indirectly then my answer is
wood b ki yaar listen 99% and 100%
of my financial future and the right to do
anything else
we
continue to be eternal
if eternal stops working and failing then
i'm just gonna turn everything else off and do this
because this is where the future and destiny are
line
large this is like a labor of love for 20
years almost now
but at one point you must be thinking like
that now this machinery is well oiled. so many
good people were deployed and the system was created. now
running on its own. i got stuck a little attention
i can lead you astray. i can go somewhere else.
there is no such thing that the system runs on its own.
is. the system also works. watch succession
planning is the main thing
in any business. we
so coming to the topic of eternal, what about eternal?
name and what does it mean and how do you
make an organization true that it is eternal
do it last
we
i used to create a system that's good
hr systems should be like this, our culture
it should be like this bla bla bla bla that
build the orchestra that drives the company
will remain
we
eventually i figured out that none of that could
last
everything will degrade over time
we
the only thing that will last is succession
planning
we
you must have a solid pipeline of leaders.
want capable enough as good as me and better
then me to be able to continue growing the
binance
we that's what eternal means
why named eternal
my mission of building an organization
which can become that we
so it's actually a mission statement
more than a claim that we are this we
it's not that we're not like eternal at all
we can die today okay something can happen and
we are done
we
i mean if
if we get band for example [laughter]
right so we're done so there's no eternal that
they eternal is about ok even if we get band
we
ok
we will find a way to rise we will find a
way to do something else we'll create
something leadership pipeline cultural pipeline
innovation pipeline
spirit tomorrow likes everything that needs to
be put in place that it can continue
rolling over and over and over and over grofers
why did you link the name because you are talking?
about planes
because grofers was associated with certain
kind of business
rebranding kids fresh energy
but it takes a lot of money to rebrand.
i'll spend the money [laughter]
day in the hand will go ahead
i also like blinkit i like both the
names i like zappo and blinkit i like
both the names of quick commerce like zapto
the sense is also good that he gives a lot
smallest part of second and blinkit's
also that just blinkit it's amazing ok i
think i think zappo's name sound sounds
cool but you have to know the meaning of it too
understand that it's really cool
or
blinkit is like a little plain and simple
vanilla cool
lemonan makes sense
lemon is cool that little one
i'm more into lemon cool stuff than [laughs]
zomato is not cool, that means it is not lemony.
don't know how
just cool cool just like cool
now you made it cool by doing certain
things must be local otherwise it was it
was a nice name when we actually first
heard of it. it's like this is a cool name.
yes, it's a good one.
yes, good, zing to zing to it, zing was
what zing was a word we used when we
heard the.
sometimes there was a near death experience, sometimes like this
looks like we spent $10,000 on it, that
would have done it in the name of fokav-wok.
past is past man.
but never thought, never thought at that time.
there was another name in the thing, $45,000.
always focus on the now, and the next week,
like, we don't
and you don't care about at all.
past is gone.
so let's talk about each of your new
passion obsession. what are you doing? how to do
are you staying? which one what do you do wa pick
up first? continue's lett i think lett
let's finish the get over lay.
yes.
then continue temple is a long story.
why late aerospace?
it's a very ambitious
long term research project. ok? i wood
from
sorbie who is the founder who me on lat
so both of us used to work at zomato
since ever right so and we used to
travel quite a lot you know here and there
we
used to do domestic also
we
it always used to be painful for us that
okay, from here we are going to pune.
come on, pune, i am talking too much.
going to chandigarh
we
so where we if we are taking a flight
it takes six hours to go there right end
if you are taking a car then it takes six hours
to go there. first of all i go to the airport
going this far. an hour and a half away
going to the airport. i will be here for an hour and a half now
i am waiting. then i'm taking a
flight like. so this is just like
senseless.
why can't i have a small airport right
next to me.
we
ok where there is a six seater at seater me
b15 20 seater. even seater small flight small
like a plane. small plane small air
take off from 20-50 meters from the strip
and that of chandigarh
land there in east west north south
go where i want to go.
we
rather than airport to airport
connectivity. like i wish there were we
just like 10 years ago we spoke about
these distributed air air stops
vision. ok? and that friend is in delhi.
let's make 25. ok? and it's like
shooting the breeze. ok.
and [laughter] nobody knows how to make planes.
nobody has even made any of us
money to even think about these things.
so this is 10 years old
this is a matter of 10 years.
shooting the bees dude makes air sticks
are.
if you have to go anywhere your
frequent flights to the
to the side of the city where you want to
go to. to the side of the city where you want
to go from.
we
and there are short flights. cheap honi cheap
there should be. they should replace train ok
and then the other thing that came to us
mind what actually excites us quite
a lot is that yer listen cities na de here
na dee dee congested
we will become de congested
why is it like that man if this is possible
so i will not stop living in delhi.
why would i live in the city at all
hmm hum i would live 100 km. away somewhere
quiet peace. ok i'd have air stop in
that small town. we
we
and i would ask zomato and any other larger
office close by and a cluster close by
build air stop there
and will come every morning. will go every morning.
if city traffic takes 45 minutes
i have to go to office. me in that time
i will come from somewhere else. hmm.
the economy will be distributed.
we
wealth will not be distributed.
factories are now near cities because
because the management is all here. ok?
cities are also not getting polluted. traffic
is also increasing. if we can make this happen.
india has just become a beautiful place
to live in everywhere.
right? and wealth wood distribute and
logistics like it was just like i could
just keep going on and on about how
wonderful would it be if we make this happen?
and
surabh after ipo blinket winket everything
like she was like gon took a break
sabbatical
we
one day both of us were talking like dude
do that and at that time one of mine
investor friends bamsi
we
was also there
we
and
he was like cool i'll fund you
vamsi vy capital so like he is early
investors at zomato from 11 12 years
ego and he was also there and he like
cool i'll fund you guys do it do it do it
and i was like cool so you do it i will
also put some money in [laughter]
just that like moment where she was like
really aerospace company me ask like we
figure zomato out not like new how to
build anything here you'll like
figure this out and she like cool let's go
come as a board member
sometimes i said ok once a month
i will come to you for half a day
that's [laughter] it
so literally late aerospace is just that we
trying to build small planes that
fly anywhere in the city
may also land
will fly and land in 20 meters
so that you can get information about air stops and airports.
iborate infrastructure is not required.
never been done in this world. this is radical
in terms of essay.
and it does in a way that even if it fails
so it doesn't matter. tried it.
absolutely. the company should be tried.
like if we don't try this shit. who else
will.
yes. now you guys have money. so you can do
all this shit.
this is where deep tech comes in. [laughter]
this is your crazy idea.
moonshots, you better try this.
are. this will take 5 years. may be 10 years
will take. but we have the patients and the
capital and i think the ability to
attract talent to work on the problem
for long enough. so
let's see wild.
how much money did you start with? how much did it take
on? how much to invest?
the total commitment on this is rs 50 million.
we take it when we need it.
over the years?
right now
between you investor and everybody. how much
did you put in?
10-20 million total has gone to him. right now
so there's 30 million more. i gave want call
it.
so you said 20 million 10 million
my time is gone total 25 out of 30
i have done
otherwise sorry they will get total 50 million
whenever they want
yes 20 have been found
will get 10 out of 20
ok and overall how much have you committed out of 50
have done
25
25
50% of the ferning is buying you
good and 50% is others
and it doesn't matter if it goes to 25.
fourth shot what are you going to do with the
money
buy more cars which i'm not going to use
no. [laughter]
i like it. it's a good way to deal and
there's nothing to do beyond a point.
fund ambitious projects.
absolutely. like i don't want to like
see charity has its own place.
i was going to ask. butts don't do charity.
i do. that also works.
that's 25 million and he gives it to charity.
friend.
did more than that. somewhere
i have done a lot of charity.
but this should also be done. this wood completely
revolutionize things. charity is not
going to create the kind of outcomes that
let aerospace will create if it works.
the landscape of the country will change. let if
it works. so this is the system this is the system
level shots that money should be used to take.
you know a lot of people will cut this
clip and be like that these founders kinda
are crazy. why do we need 10 minutes
delivery in advance. now on top of that we need smaller
why do you even need planes? better than this
you it's 2530 million which is eventual
like 100 of crores to help these people
put in. to end hunger in the country
pour. pour in to increase education in the country. he
hunger will end in the country by making these companies.
the money will not be distributed.
it's a very short term mindset that i
hunger distributed the money. and we are feeding india
let's do it. meaning
we feed millions of children.
the country is not going to change just by doing that. this
companies will build enterprises. when
then the country will be structurally changed.
the country will progress. and i'm here
and i'm here for the country now
just doing it. there are always choices too
go away but i love being here.
give me a lame man explanation. absolutely
basic explanation so that my mom and dad
do you understand or there are millions like my mom and dad?
people should understand that
charity will not bring much change. businesses
by creating, by creating such enterprises, change
will happen. why was this said and is there any merit in it?
is it? i think it's a good thought
that tough one. that's from a lot of entrepreneurs
around the world. look charity
the source of money is limited.
it ends. so when i'm feeding
india also does this for schools, right?
support to feed kids. we
one of our biggest fears is if we run out
of money ok and suddenly kids like kal khana
was not there today.
charity has this nature to it
that today is not tomorrow.
because
true
after all, money is finite. infinite
there is no capital generation anywhere.
true.
because
out of profits, out of founder wealth
from nowhere
it will end. come to an end. but when
businesses are created, they are cycles of money.
let's start. employment start
do it. ok? and the empowerment comes
over there. schools are built there.
something else keeps happening. over there
progress comes.
and we have to balance these two things out.
charity needs to make sure that's the current pain
sort of subsides
cannot subside fully.
right? so bare minimum should be done for charity
to make sure that people
could today's men survive today's problem?
basic bread cloth house basic problem
write as many solutions as you can.
educate teach as much as you can so they should i
am not saying charity is bad i'm saying
charity is amazing necessary
it should be done but it should but just this
why are you doing this comparison? why are you doing this?
not doing much and that ratio doesn't
apply i think i think doing both things
you must wear it in a balanced manner
think that's ok if i create this business
will completely radically change everything
we right
good thought sir, this lat arrow is doing space now
so let's continue
what is continuum
what is continuum
first of all don't give before i tell you that
what is a continuum? i will give you a continuation
and let me tell you the story of the temple.
we
ok.
well, i am a sucker for dr.com.
okay [laughter] dr.com okay. cool when i
is there any like cool dot com?
forget the money, how much is it coming? i take
i take it. because this dot are dot dot
comms.
d.com and some. nothing works for me. i
want dot
ok if there is agar dot nahi hai na me
looks like this is not a legitimate business
[laughter]
ok
i'm that for dots
so continue and temple were dots that i
head boat because i love the names temple.com
continue.com
yes because i loved the names
iteternal.com i also read eternal
took three years before making it.
keep the dot handy. what will we see?
sound like a trademark like a trademark
no
looks like it to me.
so eventually things happened
which side sides steve jobs used
to say no that you actually sort of connect
the dots in handside. so the site happens
on the names. i have more dot coms
well.
which ones?
leave it.
tell me one.
let them drop when.
well, that too must be something. i i have
this belief that like life happens for a reason
like things happen for a reason.
so anyway you were asking should i continue?
is it? hmm.
so i've been i've been
focusing on my health, trying to stay
healthy.
i have a genetic disposition, pre
disposition towards cardiac diseases, the
cardio cardiovascular
diseases and i also have a
predisposition towards sparkins.
ok. my mom has parkinson's and my dad
has cardio cardiovascular issues. i came to sleep
was like man i need to beat this
we miss is no about
at what age did he come?
this happened five-seven years ago.
42 in 37
this has come in 36 37.
just about before covid.
ok.
we are saying i need to beat this. i need
to be healthy.
so helps has been my obsession and also
always trying to
make mom better
make her feel better i've been researching
about ben about parkinson so i've been a
biology
we
aging
longevity health span geek for a while
okay like this has been my area of
interest like a very passionate area of
interest because i want to make sure that
i function for
we
25 30 40 more years the way i'm doing right
now and the way i used to do
we
ok and i'm not too much into living long
but there is you know health span and life
people say different things in spain
yes but i don't understand this difference
how is it
if your health span increases, your
life span will also increase.
ok? ok? if you stay healthy for a long time
life automatic
life automatically. you will be a little healthy like this
yes and one day your system says yes
your time's up. no
the unhealthy periods
will be there. it's about how far you can
push em.
ok? they might become 10 years instead of
20 years. sum of two thing. but they will be.
pushing butt health span, pushing life span
it's such a rough thing to do. ok? so i don't
i'm not in this camp that health man
don't say life span, bro it's the same thing.
dude pitical
let's keep correctness aside here.
so that's what i've been like studying
and i've done so many things too
what like optimize my health and life?
supplements countless
cryo oxygen chambers right end
rapamycin meformin
ble like tried every gum thing on like
what is known to mankind to be healthy
ok
and
this was couple of years ago
i was i was actually
walking around without my phone i was just
thinking about this healthy business is
just pay too much time
yes
what does just like mean in the morning?
let me tell you what the routine is.
oppositely we want to stay healthy
wake up early in the morning
we
don't look at the phone for an hour, take natural light
we
isn't it mindfully slow?
slow morning
we ease into your day
we
cool grounding go to the gym after we go to the gym
sona sona after ice bath this is me
i'm going to do the laundry list
prescription ok full
it's 11 o'clock, friend!
[laughter]
ok just not strengthening
sometimes it's okay to alternate with cardio.
you should also do yoga and stretching
i want it, it's okay in the evening on alternate days.
do yoga also. do all this in the evening.
then early bind down mindful eating ok
but i was like bro this is like six
hours a day
yes then or
isn't it a full time job and
i think but i have a job
yes this is 6 hours a day is a full time
job. that's 25% of my life and 25% off
my life. there's no evidence too for me
right now in and in like front of me which
tell me that if i change this 25% in my life
if i spend rs., i get even 25% of my life.
will you get more or not?
we
i was like nobody knows this.
yes.
and i don't think 25% by doing all these things
you will get more life.
we
i will get b25.
yes.
isn't it? not getting 25%.
you will also get 25%. let's say 25% is still 25.
let's get 100 out of 100. isn't it? meaning butt
25% of my life. i'm going to
spend. i am going to spend. i
i'm going to get 25% of my life back. the math
don't add up.
we
okay. i was like that yaar kuch toh na
there should be a leverage point. we
we always happen
where you move some small thing and
its ripple effect is bigger.
there are systems. we are also a system and
we should also have a leverage point
if i change something the effect is huge
we
it's like deep also you have gone mad.
we
humanity has been looking for this
forever.
no people have been liked for like eternity
looking for it. isn't it?
so like how can you even think of finding
this we
so this is me two sides of my brain
talking each other
and the other side of my brain says that friend
humanity does miss things
yes ok and you know the only way
humanity could have missed this potential
the leverage point according to was if the
the answer was so god damn obvious so right in
our face so
in our face that we just look right pastor
it
we
the other side of princess
we believable
we
all of us do these things like obvious
things like we miss a lot we like
these things do not happen in our face.
and it's like okay what could this be
and it's like shuffling through my brain
the word gravity popped into my head we're okay
and right at that moment i was like i
haven't read about
gravity and aging are always ok like there is
this constant force which we all live under
we
i never heard all this in biology
it is not. ok
we
that gravity keeps us, our aging, our
how does biology affect the earth?
we
astronauts biology in zero gravity
how does she behave? we have studied this.
so people say that we have studied gravity
end aging. no we haven't. we have studied
lack of gravity and aging.
ok? we haven't studied how gravity is.
ok?
i googled i searched i knew that there was
nothing i said i spent a month looking for
you will get something, someone said
hoga i found clues ok
somebody's saying that's okay there's a book called
sing kills
written by a nasa scientist
which emphasizes how chronic inactivity is?
amplify the effects of gravity on ourselves
body bodies and why head down tilts
could be good for you.
okay okay. so this person is not saying
gravity's with you
to have to do with
have to do with or gravity is a huge
is a factor.
but there are least like a little close. ok?
there are little research papers which go
close.
hmm
but not from the thing. ok that friend ok listen is
gravity by b age. i'm not saying that
it's the only reason why be old. it is is
it's one of the overlook reasons that reasons
could be potentially a thing.
potentially a thing and i was like deep
listen you can't go say these things to people.
will say ok, he has gone mad. gone mad.
discover it and sit peacefully at home
go. because you have a reputation of zomato
eternal bl bl bl bl
and i was like listen if this is true
it's my moral responsibility to make
sure that the world knows this like i can't
i will not be able to take this to my
grave's friend, i knew it was right and
i didn't say on mega phone but if this is
true, i had little idea at that time.
didn't know didn't know. i was like but you are
will study whether this is true or not.
we
what did i do to even study?
i didn't
folks, i gathered a team. i have
said friend, discover it.
we
let's try to discover this. contradict
do it because that's the easiest way to refute
anything. not living in confirmation bias
me. we
let's try to discover this. i'm going
to walk away in peace and say there's nothing
do it. let's move ahead. we
months after months of work hours contra
teams become pro teams ok we find another
contra team they became pro we found another
contra team happens four times
ok they didn't find any evidence anywhere
who discovers this. zero zero
contradictions found ok the entire body of
science can't look for this and let me
actually take a step back and tell you
what exactly did we look for
yes means first tell me what is yours
hypothesis and what you were looking for
so we said gravity the thought came to me that
man is gravity one of the underlooked reasons
yes sir
and like reasons by we age and
we don't know how much of a factor it is
we
okay it could be a factor study that
what's going on? ok?
and before we even figure out we have to choose
a mechanistic explanation or we think
this is why gravity could be aging us.
what was it?
i came up with theories. we're just white
white boarding.
very outsider in point of view. and
i think our strength forces us to do nothing
used to come.
we
ok? and we know a little physics.
i know biology and a little chemistry.
math comes, logical reasoning comes
and all of those things combined we are
thinking of ok how could this even be true
if this were true
so we came up with this thing called this
the story that our heads are above our hearts
and because of gravity our heart takes a
little bit of extra effort to push blood
to the brain
and a little bit less blood goes to the brain
we
then it should be because our head is above ours
hearts.
ok and if there is less blood going to the
brain there has to be some little bit of
damage to the brain because of it's not getting
enough blood.
ok. and if there is this enough little bit of
damage, they should accumulate over time.
hmm. and if this accumulates over time
and has been the master sort of controller of
the body, let's say it is and we know that it
is.
is this the reason why first
brain aging happens. and then the body ages
because the brain can't keep the body healthy.
so these are all the questions. yes.
this is still happening only in if if
question.
it's all in if. nothing is proven
is. right now
nothing is proven. us us us
haven't opened any research paper yet
this is our first two weeks off
the idea came when
it's just a rabbit hole to think in one
direction.
think in one direction. three or four before that
and the theories we created ourselves
contradicted that this is possible
there is no explanation for this.
ok?
i don't even remember they were so stupid.
we
but this one made sense.
ok?
i put together a team. just for myself
and that was my personal fitness team ok
that dude i want to measure my brain from
we
and that's what we started building
we
we started building a device
what we benchmark with mri
tcds ok and works beauty beautifully
now and we're further benchmarking it third
party validations are also happening now before
we may take it to the market for me
i only need third party validation because
know the data is correct. ok? but if we are
if and when we're going to market it
we will have third party validations.
so
we build this device and the kind of
learnings that we have while we are
wearing temple. the first temple was like
this big.
we
there was a wire going behind it. battery here
was. the one hanging here. [laughter]
so he used to roam around wearing these.
yes. used to roam around wearing it. used to sleep
in that. we used to see good sleep
what happens? brain in deep sleep
what's happening to brain flow? and there
so much math so much like this was a research
topic for us for one year and tuning the
devices and making it better and still we
are tuning and making it better and better
and better in different cases
we figured out that everything
what is known to mankind to be healthy
increases blood flow to the brain
and everything that's known to us that's not
healthy decreases blood flow to the brain
which then stacked up as one more
clue slash evidence point in the gravity
aging hypothesis
that listen this cbf thing you should know
upstream of a lot of things it may not
just be a downstream effect of entropy
and aging okay it could be upstream i'm
not claiming it's upstream i'm saying
i just can't i i just can't unsee the
body of evidence
ok we'll prove it right or wrong
hm hum incidentally
but it's hard to unsee the body of evidence
a story like this has never come together
beautiful in biology at all like
this
we
okay so like that makes me feel there is
something here which we need to do like father
so here we have done this research on gravity aging.
it will start with whether you can prove it or disprove it.
let's do it. we started talking to
researchers scientists we like funding
studies. so there is a lot of work going on
there and here then we started building
this experiencing mental brain fruit
device end
and we're just finding it so useful we are
like friend, we do anything healthy.
goes up. do anything untoward
goes down. when this is going well in
a day i'm feeling so good. when this is
down in a day i'm feeling so shit.
this is a biomarker what i need in my
life right so and that relatability
it's not well known this is this is not
something that's ever been measured on a like
continuous basis
we
so for us i was like that man it's good
they make the best products
let's make this and let's take it to people
who would value this and for us this was
like's science research projects categories
creation is a very new thing.
we
and
i don't expect to be massive
i really expected to be really the one to go to
device for people who care people who are
scientific enough and who's geeky enough too
understand that my heart rate only
tells me part of the story. my vo2
max only tells me part of the story.
my resting heart rate only tells me
part of the story. but here's this new
the matrix which could tell me the entire story
which could be the master biomarker?
for everything
for everything input and output good and bad
that's how we're feeling
ok
and it's not just how we're feeling
then we dig deeper into research
we
so that's why we like to create that variable.
it was a very
hard hardware rad project to do a
we had to miniaturize this to this level.
we got stuck here.
stuck here in a way because the first thing we did
we created the device just for this
made. for this very place, it was not
like we do that here to make for.
the capillaries here are very thin and
dense. and they are very like close to the
skin. so any sensor we put reads the
signal very nicely like much more than yours
finger your wrist and anywhere else. so wee
r like that dude proxy from here
that this is the flow of the head. external to this
carotid artery internal carotid artery
will do approximate math of artery. some how
will calibrate. so from that we get brain flow
will take it out.
we
so all our calibration was for here.
we
we just can't do it again. it it was a
lot of cost. [laughter]
that's why it is visible here. then give v
got stuck here. i'd have made a device
for this for somewhere else but all the science
and all the effort right was done for here. v
try it doing somewhere else. but we are
not getting the accuracy like if
we did not get it. then we like cool. and at
that time somebody also said depend.com
near you. we should call it call it that temple
that's what you're implying
this is what you are calling it, we are calling it something else
the giver
is this like what is it? is there anyone inside here?
you are doing blood test with injections
what is it just a sensor?
no, it is non-invasive like a sticker.
is this
it's just a sticker
yes double sided tape
yes
there will be a tape applicator and you will apply the tape on it.
just stick to it and you're done
end tape is super solid hum
you can't get out and
seven days battery life five to seven days
go swimming gold go iron
man, go surfing, put a tape out.
will not come
we
and it took it super easy even out of comfort
she will come
we
but if you're not going to pluck
it out this device will not come out it's
super easy and it measures blood flow to you
ware
but then when you're assuming that's it
falls then someone likes you so big public
go public and write this on a public statue
it doesn't seem like you are posting it, people.
wrong influence will go without having
some extreme to the tee evidence man see this
i'm not from this background
we
and for me i needed to put this
hypothesis out to call for global research
to call for research to reach out to us and
research this on their own i wanted to
spark a new branch of science
we.
ok? this is just about this hypothesis
i am not. this is not just about
dec. ok? even if this hypothesis
turns out to be right and wrong, it will
spark off a lot of new branches of
science.
we
which will buy themselves a lot
about how we treat aging and the brain
biology. so it was just my thing man
take it. whatever inspiration comes to his mind
now do it. my job here as a researcher
is limited and i can do but i don't
have the ability
and the resources to do this beyond a point
and resources is not just money right so
you need to have the labs you need to have the
infrastructure and bl bl bl you need
to have the right doctors and the scientists
to be able to do this since we made this
public over a 100 scientists and
researchers from all over the world have
reached out to us saying we think you guys are
onto something we'll run this experiment
on our own ok we will share data with you
please share anything that you also find so
that we can improve our experiment does
some research like ya listen we want to do
this we have some of this data
can you give us a little bit of funding
because of our funding from the us government
has dried up so we can prove and disprove
part of this pretty fast we're like cool
you guys go ahead write some questions like
listen we never have a lot of this data we
can for example see weather we have like ah
mri for a thousands of people we can see
weather perfusion in the brain for shorter people
is there less perfusion in the brain for taller
peepal. that's a significant piece of
evidence if they like if they are able to crack
it. it's like but now we need to take
permissions from the person who funded that
study? so we are now following the process to
be able to but did you reach out to anyone
prominent body?
any prominent
which is already established whose word
will matter. may be some institute some
educational institute cum hospital
institute some body of neurologist
neuroscientist
i don't know we
if you are working on gravity then i can
isro and nasa
we did we have reached out to so many people
friend
the first one we did was i'll tell you the hole
story when we had this for the first time
when we started researching on this
we reached out to some scientists and researchers
and
and then we told them okay this is what we
are thinking they are like are you mad we auto
there is regulation, it happens a little.
when astronauts come back from space
deterred and come right how do you
explain that and we did have answers to
do we like okay we must be wrong withdrawal
we did it cool. after one and half
years of work now we had answers to all
these things we
astronauts come back because
gravity is important. we are not saying this
that you disappear from gravity
will live. we will be able to live only in gravity. butt
we also age due to gravity.
this is paradoxical. ok? now you
negative gravity by living in gravity
solve effects by interweaving them
to whatever extent possible.
people like us that's what you say. this
was one month before we release the
gravity aging high gravity aging
hypothesis
we spoke to the most eminent
most well known people in this field
people have written books on brain
ok and we told them grand them through ours
entire body of work which was like 80
pages long
not something i can post on twitter at all
[laughter]
so
so when we took them through the document the
comments that we used to get from a lot of
these people like from harvard medical school
from
like university in france like like some
like super well respected
scientists in canada right globally runaround
people like and lucky
because of me being like zomato founder i
used to be able to get them on half an hour
zoom calls with me are better than nobody's used to.
i am not on a 15 minute 30 minute zoom call.
i will come and then these zoom calls are used to last
for two hours
because they are all married in it and they
they all like they like tell me more tell me more
tell me more the kind of comment that you should
we used to get after all of this was man
i think you guys know more about the brain than
almost anybody in the world likes right now
that's the kind of comments we use to get
from like eminent scientists across the
world because they are like everybody does one
part of the brain and they go deep in there
okay but you guys have gone broad as well
as deep while trying to connect all of the
dots and the kind of knowledge and the kind
of research you've done with spans decades
is there something we've seen anybody else too
that's the kind of you're getting feedback we
got
but tell me when you posted on twitter
put so people like liver dock he said that
it's dangerous it's pseudo science you startup
make a startup, make that's just.
put an end to that absolutely everybody is
in everybody is entitled to their opinion
and rand
liver dog like people i don't think
let's listen. just have to speak. ok? i have
didn't message him and saying this purely
for the sake of science. respect for
whatever he does and whatever he is good
et. i told him, friend, do one thing for me.
you are calling it pseudo science. please come on
zoom.
i will explain you and then you can
decide and if you think and if you actually
tell us we're wrong i'm happy to admit
it's in public sorry guys this is wrong. hm
i'm wrong.
right? i have zero shame in admitting this
that i'm wrong. my like identity is
not too tight for this.
yes.
not at all.
we
ok?
not yet. [laughter]
apna never
okay. means i'm i've done bigger
things and this is just one of the things.
so i was like sir come on zoom call.
let me tell you. he says, i have time
it is not.
like is correct. cool to rent with you
i have time but i actually have you.
time to evidence with the science team
not there. that is not the time to speak. his
he put six more posts nearby
long and long. i said you're just bull shit
you have time to do it. ok. i came to sleep
lost respect for him at that time. i
i used to listen to was like right before
whatever.
and
but what if this is wrong? what if this
the gravity hypothesis is wrong. to this
your reputation at stake
no, not at all.
why? don't think like this if i go wrong
wrong.
people will call me stupid do you
are you crazy?
i will tell people. i'll be the first
one to tell people because i'll be the person
converging evidence. i'll tell people.
guy's listen hypothesis turns out to be
rong.
i got nothing with it. no public cost
not over it
what is the public cost of being like?
curious in asking play questions there
there is no public cost is not for me
i have no ego i am very shameless
in asking questions which matter right?
questions do matter somebody should be asking
them but what do you think that
neuroscientists all around the world so
researchers all around the world
what's missed that you're able to find
i don't know first of all i think i have
this like outsider in point of view where
i can think from physics i can think
system does i can think biology like i
m
half 50% good on multiple things
so i think that was my like strong
sweet outside and see when
when this happens
the other thing is i don't think i'm the
first person to whom this first time
i came up with the idea
i think i'm the first person whom
your reputation
who has this idea?
[laughter]
because the ideas they must come, people come
will be right so end when i have such wacky
when ideas come, i don't discard them.
i do them without confirmation bias
i had nothing to do without emotional attachment
prove's friend
let's see
if i don't pay attention
too true random world changing ideas
else do you expect more bills.
so i feel this is my moral obligation.
that if even the odd possibility
of changing future of humanity mankind
comes to me and i think that's true for you
age well. right? so if if that happens to
u. like you would put everything on the line
from the end friend, i will keep telling this to everyone.
means desire for results by performing actions of harma types.
don't do it. will figure this shut out right? so end
that was my plan.
but a lot of people will say that this is just
there is a mask. he has to earn more money. now this
the new device that has been made has to be sold. its
for this is a simple hypothesis from the mind
making and selling it. i am not
do you you you you people will say that.
people already saying that's probably?
offcourse offcourse people are so smart. yes.
if i could make this device and listen to it,
i don't want to sell, i don't want to sell it, i don't want to sell it.
to a celebrity, out of four crores, no means three.
would have worn celebrities by giving them sponsorship
my sales would come.
why wood i
by the way have you ever seen such an iborate
marketing plan? what? what kind of things are you saying
are you staying? [laughter] do you think i went through
means three eight decades of research to sell a
device like come on like this is not something
this even doesn't make business sense this is like
he is a conspiracy theorist isn't he?
those who are in their conspiracy theory bubble
have to live and that living has to die there too
it happens that people say all this
things [laughter]
but this is not for pure greed obsession
that's another new thing to make money
i will make it as big as zomato.
it's just pure and money which is
driving this entire thing.
i don't think i don't think about money. i
think this is a bloody cool thing to do right.
so and money is an outcome. 4% edge will be attached
near me. even then there is a lot. how does it matter? that money will not be spent for the rest of your life.
in. what am i going to do with the
money man. i'm going to donate it to
charity. build new companies which will
create more jobs. but tell me what is this
what kind of biomarker is important in brain flow?
which is the existing device which is able to do
she is not able to major already?
existing devices all of them are first
of all like [laughter] nirs which is a
device which make sure that
de vary balki.
so nirs scan measures there are multiple
large bulky things mri scan
we
butt
we just miniaturized it
so this regular seemed to me in miniature version
why do i have to test my brain every day?
how much flow
if you do activities to keep your
brain flow up will make you feel better over time
right you will understand okay this is the
kind of behavioral pattern that actually
take it down this is the kind of
behavioral patterns that takes you goals
give yourself to me friend, if i can do that much
i will hit this many goals if you continue
hitting two goals will make you stay healthier
for a long period of time this is all
science fact, we are saying that friend
increasing brain flow is a good thing.
that's what everyone is saying. it's all the same
are speaking. this is an established fact.
is.
put i'm saying up.
isn't it? you set your goal. now this which
what happens to the top 1%? top
how much is 10? there is established science.
we have the numbers for this. and now
do the benchmark. keep moving up and down. ok? this is now we just basically put a
software layer on top of actual science
which helps you set a goal and take sort
of achieve two goals.
ok? and this is basically over the long term
we think that this will lead to better health.
c, if without clinical trials when you
talk about all this so publicly
yes, people get influenced, so don't
you think it's responsible to not talk
about all of this. until you have proven
something.
man, i think my responsibility is too
from the truth.
hmm
that's how it is with the total caviars.
please behave responsibly.
we
don't run away. don't be crazy.
we
ok? treating you like an adult
i people to adults.
we
ok? if you are saying friend the world is crazy
what are you doing? you are responsible.
behave means come on right let's all treat
each other's age adults and figure this stuff out
right i'm telling you the truth i want more
research ok cool i want people to know i
also this is not just about the gravity
aging hypothesis for me i also want
this building science into public culture too
happen in like india ok this is like yaar
i'm sure this is the first time in the
last two decades where science has gone main
stream us
okay this was for me this is like that man
if we don't even bring change culturally then we are useless.
i mean, how much can you talk about random things?
but we won't talk about things like that.
is this the kind of these are the kind of
these are the kind of topics which will raise
our average iq on how to interpret these
things. how to increase responsibility?
meaning if we tell the whole country the whole world
if he continues to work thinking that he is an idiot, then he
and he will continue to become stupid. let's not do
dec.
fair but then you run zomato we are that
majority of people use it so that they
can eat junk at 3:00. that means at 3:00
like can eat overall junk. right? so at one
side you become a billionaire by actually giving
guilt about giving people what they want
and at one side you're promoting
be healthy, live long, not 100 years, not 180 years.
sal live all that so i are don't you
from a place of contradicting yourself
you deliver junk food at 3:00 at night
at one place you are saying that people should be healthy.
go i don't think so at all that i
i am contradicting
why
i order from zomato 10 times a week
order we're perfectly fine.
ok? again this is about yaar yeh
is the platform. you have to indulge.
indulgence will also be available. isn't it? you mean
if you want to eat unhealthy then you will eat.
zomato and no zomato.
we
zomato's customer base is a small fraction
there is no population of india. do you think
do the rest of the people not have diabetes?
are we doing anything? no. we're just
another retail outlet of food. what you choose
to pick from what that retail outlet is
your choice.
we are not spoiling people.
people are doing whatever they are doing too
themselves.
if there are chips in the supermarket next door
if you pick it up at the counter then you are the one.
but you're supposed to say that you're not
promoting unhealthy culture at all
and are you guilty of promoting some
extent so there was there used to be a
this is what we solved over the last
month
when we started getting all these hits we
some things unconsciously mistakenly
it was cooked
we
for example if we have push notification
if you have eaten biryani once then you will like it again.
i used to say to him, "friend, will we eat biryani?"
so these reminders are borderline evil
we
these promote unhealthy things we stop doing
two things
ok
now you don't need all this reminder to biryani
we won't do it if you ask, jeric.
will say he is hungry
order please hungry order we are
like we never do targeted unhealthy dish push
notifications
eat this ice cream, eat this motichu laddu
used to do everything with me
they do like that will stop all the drama
all of all
already done in the process this needs massive
code changes may be ongoing
interesting and then do you feel that you can't
sit alone with yourself that's why you just keep
building new thing
keep trying and people also say that
sumtice
people get addicted in some sort of just
keep building new thing sit with yourself
can't because it's not an old game
exciting enough
i love the game man old game i still i
still review product mock set zomato
blinked sometime i'll be ranse blinked
for most of the time but zomato
i do products anytime. a
i think i'm just a
just a curious person. i can sit alone
with myself. will r i live in between
i very often. but than i've never done
things out of necessity. ok i
if i'm free, i'll do something. right? i
told you the journey of
okay, i've been looking to salt for me
health. gravity aging hypothesis. letts
measure a device. so temple. oh wow this is
so useful. the world would need it.
let's build it. ok. like this is like,
i'm just so excited to take temple too
the world. that this is going to be so life
changing for people who like to use it. so its
not i'm not doing this for the money. i
have enough of it.
but i want to i want to do this for the
joy of it. and
temple is also the first time. i am
building something where it's me, my team and
the user. we there's nobody else in the
process. there is no restaurant. who can
send the wrong food. there is no rider hu
can't grow in the like experience. like us
we were talking about perfection in zomato.
not possible. we're like this is a
products which will be made with absolute
full love right and we'll get it perfect.
so that's what we're aiming for together?
do you think that you're doing sometimes the
things just for
more influence, more power, more
ego massage that i got it more things right
than wrong
i don't care i'm just doing my thing
do you care about power i don't even get
out i don't even if i care about
power i would do way more podcast i
probably start a podcast
[laughter]
if i care about influence i would do
these things i don't care
i actually want to be able to do my
work quietly.
but do you become friends with powerful people,
influential government office and all of
that?
i don't know anyone. i stay in my cocoon
and do my work?
you don't care about being powerful at all.
no.
have you worked in the room and where you felt
you are powerless.
i mean helpless for sure but [laughter]
even today or i mean sometimes we walk in
situation we're like helpless but
helpless is a life thing it's not a thing
situational thing life happens to you and she does it
haps
butt or i don't care
i am very happy just like me my
team and the world doing things right
building things
geeking out
i don't spend much money right goes on
come on you spend a lot
not really
meaning
these things mean everything when forming these companies.
his job
not much compared to what i could spend it
se small fraction so you don't spend a
lot and sir have you walked in any room where
u ft in ferrier
and i this happens to me all the time
almost
ok explain
everything every time i do something new
which is outside my comfort zone
i feel like that for example late
right way engineers
whenever means sometimes in a month i go to their
what are they talking about
ok c by l l by d and it's just
feels like i'm so dumb right right so
[laughter]
and i'm good at physics but i'm able to
grass but inferiority complex to come
goes there
be in the temple this is the first time
hardware is being done so it started
off with why are you doing hardware and
why are you making it? don't tell anyone.
this company will give likes for you
i am not making it, i have to make it for myself.
i need to know what goes into it so that
i can really know weather this is telling me the
truth or not
this is for me
why are you making this for you ok just
for you like yes just like why who does
things were just for themselves i like
because i'm curious i can do good
lo right so and like than you higher people and
then you feel inferior in front of them so
it happens like anything you touch like for
example of all the scientist conversations that happen
we did before launching introducing the
gravity aging hypothesis avery
conversations i used to feel like i used
to start with thank you so much for your
time appreciate it i know i am probably
the last person you want to get on a call
with and you're like wondering why am i
getting on a call with this food delivery guy
from india and why is he asking me
for time but thank you like so i can
please go ahead
so intellectually inferior you feel
but have you ever compared based on money like this?
someone has more money than me
i think people have a lot more money than me
think they have less money
they don't have enough money [laughter]
i think i've always felt i've had enough
money no matter how much money i have i think the
the only thing money does is
it saves you some time hum
pretty much that nothing else
so i mean your home right you will have some
space you can work better increase efficiency
it's better that you don't do some things yourself.
read somebody else will do these things for
you're right i think that's pretty much
the value add of money. i think it too
gives one more thing which i think you will
agree once you have enough money whatever enough
definition is it also makes you delusional
about your own beliefs and the things that make you
doing like it makes you more delusion like
you go stronger at something that you are
doing because then you know that down side is
being covered
i doesn't apply to me why i mean what
what's the down side in general life in let's say
everything goes down to zero
hm
do you believe in yourself to be able to make
a living next month?
or
yes same here.
but if this goes away then this life will go away.
so what difference does it make? meaning i will build
this back in three four five years?
do you really really believe that there is zero difference
it falls. if i had gone anyway
people speak just to speak.
meaning if it becomes zero then off course than you
really really need to eat and all of dose
things. right? means i have taken offcourse
friends and enough social equity to even
boro money
we
and i have
okay like this was four years ago from lb
i had spent a lot of money boro boro boro
run my own life
so but then i recovered [laughter]
have you ever in your entire journey got an
egotistic
websys
what do you do when you feel egoistic?
please tell people around.
but what did you do? what was the worst
thing you're not proud of?
i mean i think what ego manifest is in
that you stop listening to the truth. like so
what you're telling yourself and the world
that's my version of the truth is the right version
of the truth. so that leads to friction.
that leads to faces getting pissed at you and
and i can generally face getting pissed at
i am doing something that is not right.
going on then i think ups and downs
let's keep going in what's your biggest
insecurity today
my biggest insecurity is that
i should not
i should not
and up lying to myself in any way. so
intellectual honesty
not being inside me is my biggest fear
because of the kind of work i do if i'm not
being intellectually honest as it can go
very wrong
so
so it's a high risk, this manowar
all of these are my own intellectual
honesty and watching my own thoughts and
feelings and he was and keeping them in
check
that's super and weather i'm going to
be able to do that or not is something that i
consciently
i am aware of mindful law wawful loss
just scared of getting swede away by yours
circumstances
bye about bye whatever i don't know bye
something right so please like stay centered
humble
don't think about yourself focus on the work
work be honest don't care about outcomes
you don't care about weather it's gravity
aging is right and wrong is following the path
of truth follow the tell you don't care about
tupper right and wrong do your best work ok
release it only if you're actually convinced
this is useful else tank it can do it right
so end
i would not i would only like release
temple and i'm even if i said like coming
deserted
i'm ready to say sorry guys not coming
[laughter]
something fell right this isn't this isn't
gonna make sense but i really want to make
sure that if this goes out this becomes
this is not just about temple there
is also this i i always have this india
and being this like role model
for india kind of a
n like intention behind things that man this
to create a world class hardware company
is. don't do this random nonsense around here.
okay, this is good enough. right means apple should
like steve jobs should look at this and say
good job. right? so like that standard
like and that quality of it works. that
quality of user love. right? so if i am
if i think we get there only then i am
not and then i'm putting this out fair.
and what do you think is the biggest
misunderstanding about you?
biggest misunderstanding about me. i
think it's not just about me but i fall
into that bucket. right?
people na india has a india has a bad
relationship with wealth.
i don't india at large think that
wealthy people are evil and steal money
is made
we are not true, not by stealing money.
money is made by making people's money.
is like i don't think we stole somewhere
is right so i think we have created
value we have created jobs we have
actually create the largest number of
jobs in the history of india may be if
i can put this you could verify this fact
i don't know but i think
butt
like so okay we had some money where
should we deer it we're going to put it too
good use we're going to spend some of it
on for us as well and the way we are
spending that money is exactly what all
of you dream about that you will spend your
money
like when you make that kind of money so
when
we're living the life of your dreams and
this was the life of our dreams. so why
pull us down? why are you like this, you
well, you do it for the money. work
what is it friend?
so you do it too. if i can
you can do it too. stop talking. stop
having this negative relationship with wealth.
that and wealth will also come to you. so
i think that's slightly weird but i
agree to this point because for the longest
i've said this before on the podcast end
multiple times that's for the longest time
i thought that money cannot be made only by stealing.
could. only useless people can make it.
you have to be crooked. and it's not
like that. infarct
when i stopped thinking about money
since then i started earning more.
exactly exactly
meaning i have never cared about saving
money. i have never counted money. like me
i used to have something for someone.
if you want, i will give it. ok? even like
people around when they have troubles, issues,
some family i'm like very very okay
friend, take it. and never ask for it back. hm
so and some how i think that karma comes back
right so and the more you try to protect
it's you're very scarcity mindset again
scarcity mindset doesn't create abundance
outcomes abundance outcomes create abundance
mindset creates abundant outcomes true
it's on our wall in my office.
that money is like orgasms more in the center
you try to choose it the less chances you have
[laughter]
like stop thinking about it a lot ya
absolutely had a last question for you
you know you have a daughter
what do you want your daughter to think about
you in 10 years from now
imagine you directly talking inter daughter
like right now she's watching this | what
why i want her to think about me 10
years from now.
i i'd i don't have an answer to this. i
just want to make sure that i don't do more
and up doing anything that she is
shameful of a shamed one.
i don't care weather i do something weather she
is proud of and not. that's fine. his
there are choices. she might have different things
that she wants to be proud of and not but
the things that
humans are generally ashamed of are fairly common
so i'd i'd want to make sure i
don't end up doing any of these things.
do you think you're cable
of doing something shameful?
everybody else. so and there is no such thing
as there is no true thing that it is milk
is washed and it is not. no true thing.
it's about
how much can you observe your negative side
and how much can you keep it in check everybody
has that side.
are you good at keeping in check?
reasonably i think
but you know if i become too confident about
this statement that i'm making to you
right now i'll screw this up fair to i
have to stay on the border of
but it may not be true you might still be
screwing up something right so
constant swallowing self doubt that i might
actually b
things up keeps me in check.
thank you so much. thank you for spending truth
a long time with me is pleasure hosting
u.
this was fun exhausting both of [laughter]
butt
i think at the same time.
you know this was the first interaction. i came to sleep
had to come prepared
based on all the researches. am.
but there was so many things i pointed
and i rot down. it's like made some notes
and mental notes.
at one point whenever next time six
months, one year later, we'll have a
conversations where there be no papers, just
you and me randomly talking about things
and will dive deep.
have fun.
[music]
i was trying since 2021 that i
should i do a podcast? like last year we
then i gave up hope that it's okay when
it will happen, types will try for two-three years.
but this morning when i was going
through everything [music]
i was so happy that this is happening right now because
i do podcasts
and i ask very stupid questions and
i [laughs] i wasn't that mature at that time.
and i would have said such things at that time
where does zato sell the most?
is pizza sold or biryani sold? you know
that's the first initial days of
curiosity. the thanks that's happening
now.
i think so true. dude does conversations
how much does pizza sell for? how much biryani
is it sold? they've been had 100 times.
what's something that you hate? that this again and again
people ask. i mean i'm tired
i am ready to give this answer. what what is
that? is that anything?
how was zomato started?
how was it named? like two questions
lakh
so everyone asks. give even today
even today i get two questions and i was
like kill google man. [laughter]
if you have to ask something ask something
new [music] which you can't find somewhere
else.
thank you so much for watching this episode till the end.
for. now you have to do three things. the most
first subscribe this channel because
the more you subscribe the better
and we will be able to bring you valuable guests.
for. number two tell me this in the comments
what did you like about the episode and what else?
felt dirty so that we don't repeat the same mistake.
could do it. and who are the guests that you
want to check back on our podcast?
so that we can bring them and give you more and more
be able to provide more value. and number three is this
please share the episode with at least one person
do it because one conversation can change
someone's life. i'll see you next time.
until then keep figuring up. [music]
[music]
