we look at western cultures we look at
western world and the startups which
have worked there right and we try to
copy that here that's terrible you know
from the maybe 100 unicorns today i
don't think the out of these hundred
more than 25 will be unicorns in the
next two to three years we should really
be cautious that they should not become
the inspiration for all your listeners
and viewers here also today because
actually that's a bad example to follow
but this gold standard that we put on
this self acclaimed back thumping chest
thumping approach because five people
backed you at a certain valuation and
you manage that your problems are all
starting now don't you feel that some
people should not be an entrepreneur and
they're trying to become entrepreneurs
today's episode is with the india media
mughal and the education mughal as well
at the same time today we spoke to
ronnie screwwala who started his journey
from the scratch on the streets in
mumbai and turned around his life into
something really really big he started
with building a media house then he
bought a kabaddi team and turned that
around then he started an attack company
called upgrad and now he is actually
helping every indian learn better and
get upgraded with their skills so that
they can lead better in their life in
today's episode we've spoken about the
media education sector entrepreneurship
what young entrepreneurs make mistake
what is the difference between venture
funded startups and bootstrap starters
and so many more tips which you and i
everybody will be benefited from and if
you feel that this vodka is really long

just short amount of time enjoy today's
show
tell me like were you always like this
big dreamer and dream with your feet on
the ground or like you started as i
think i started with feet on the ground
i don't think i started with dreaming so
you're not born into riches you're not
what's the background like you mean yeah
i mean yeah a complete lower middle
class background in a place in mumbai
called grant road i do remember we had a
large joint family there was no private
bedroom the toilet was at the end of the
door and i spent my first 17 years
incredible grounding in those days the
you know the there was a lovely cafe 786
on the ground floor which served the
best biryani in grant road and the best
jalebis okay
um my two aunts and my mom used to teach
the piano so i think all my first few
girlfriends were all uh students piano
students
impress them yes i learned how to play
the piano in the process but that is
compliments to my mom and my aunts not
not the not the girlfriends but very
very fond memories and that's why i
meant that you get grounded you know
then your expectation on life is
everything is up there and i think many
of the times when i've been set back my
introspection was now how worse can it
get at worst look at the first 17 years
of my life i was very happy then so even
if i get back to even that level how bad
can it get it allows you and empowers
you to take lots of risks and lower your
expectations in life hmm interesting
okay tell me one interesting
lesson that you learned while you were
going through that phase or like from i
wouldn't i don't want to call that
adversity but like in the initial years
of your life like something that you
learned and that still stays with you
yeah i think well i mean i'm coining it
now i don't think it was i was not
mature enough to do then you know where
i learned
a couple of things one is you're on your
own i mean you're on your own in many
ways i mean not from a family family
ecosystem is always there but you're on
your own and the second one is
when you choose to do something you have
to go about it with you don't have a
choice right because i think when i told
my parents that i want to do something
on my own that was a big shock for them
like it is for most 99 of the parents uh
that want to look at that but they were
like good party parents
quietly worrisomely supportive okay
um and i think
one of the things that my parents said
is look even if you finally want to do
this i just want to tell you you're on
your own because we don't have the money
for your first mistake forget about your
second mistake and your third mistake
and i think that rang a bell with me
that says you know you're on your own
and therefore you don't have a choice
and when you have these two
non-parachutes
non-parachutes with you in life it kind
of holds you very tightly and makes
again your feet on the ground always
that's a that's a very interesting take
because you are on your own and mostly
what you do yeah but i'll tell you a
contradictory thing like with i also
grew up in like a middle class family
and didn't have enough money for the
mistakes and stuff but my parents on the
contradictory maybe because now the
generation has changed and like so much
awareness is there they have always been
that okay we know that we don't have
enough resources but even if you fail
don't worry correct like they were so
satme i think is is all parents like i
mean all parents would be sats i think
what they were telling me in a very
materialistic senses while our spirit
will be willing our wallet
you know they always say i'm asking this
question because people say this right
that the money changes you success
changes you the more you achieve you
kind of become like a different person
so that's why like the belief system and
the things that you value do that change
i've seen that happen with people and
i'm not sitting here from the pulpit and
trying to lecture uh i i hope when i
have my own report card that it doesn't
reflect for me that money has changed
anything for me but i can see that it is
quite intoxicating right because it's a
thumbs up for you what is it you know
when you see that what do you do money
attracts people thumping your back it
attracts more friends than you want it
attracts a fan club which can be which
can be disappeared the next day it makes
every glory look non-fleeting whereas it
should be fleeting so it can go to
people's head
um and it just sounds like you're an
invulnerable and actually you are a
vulnerable at every given stage and the
world is fragile it is fragile today in
many many ways right i mean what do you
mean by the fragile war i mean it's an
it not just changes it is a fragile
world today i think the biggest
challenge for any person young
or old uh aren't wanting to do something
in their own or in a job in a career or
not in a profession as a lawyer or a
doctor or whatever else has to deal with
fragility because the cons there's so
many things that are actually changing
in around you and 50 of them are not in
your control
right i mean i'm not talking about the
macro things about war in ukraine and
two banks collapsing or the economy go
those are all i think we have to live
that that's going to be a way of life
but fragility today i think you know
what troubles me frankly is the fact
that almost 10 15 of the people today
are have more of a mental crisis i mean
we are now vocally talking about the
context of uh mental health right versus
health most people would have scorned on
that yeah firstly i'm one treat somebody
who's genuinely sick you think i'm gonna
wait for you because your mind is not
working how dare your mind is not
working go fix it but today that's real
so which means there's a so much of
fragility in the world that's creating
so much conflict in your mind uh and
there's so much information that comes
your way you know and i think my
brother-in-law told me one point there
last week he says i'm going to put that
watch on you it's going to give you a
lot of data you can do that when you ex
i said look i'm dealing with too many
data points i don't want more data right
now in my life and i don't mean data in
that sense just any more information to
process because frankly you need to you
need to chill you need to relax you need
to get the thoughts that come flow into
your mind so to me fragility is is
things outside your control will change
things within you will control and
change they will change more sharply
than ever before if something was bad
news you'll have time to process it
maybe even avert it go back and do it i
think that's becoming less and less
before you can digest it it could be
fatal you know i am asking this to you
because i recently read about like
couple of silicon valley founders who
have all made it multi-million dollars
in last four to five years like from
zero to four five years and then there
was a study done on there like there's
80 of them they found out majority of
them are data control freaks sure and
they track their life their time their
body not only their organization and
their productivity they track themselves
in fact so i was having a conversation
with someone about this and they said
like they track the um
the steps they do the food they eat the
calories the intake like every little
thing about everything like they just
track everything do you think like that
kind of tracking becomes no and i can
tell you is it good or bad legacies no
right there's no judgment call it's each
one to their own sorry what would you
say i would not say no i think that's
relevant but for each time so i will
answer that question by saying if there
are 80 of them a b in silicon valley c
then multi-million and they've done it
between 2019 and 2022 that's a different
era will they be able to do it if it
started in 2020 to 2025 probably not
and that's the difference between saying
i'm a data freak and therefore i mean
because there were things that had not
been in control whatever velocity they
thought that got them there 50 is
serendipity and tailwind if some sorts
that that gets you to a certain level
number one uh two the opportunities in
each place are also very very different
right and you can do that for a
momentary time in four or five years the
question would be can we track these
same 80 people over the next seven years
and figure out whether how many of them
kept their wealth
if wealth is the benchmark because
they're the other unfortunate part is
your benchmark of all of this is wealth
yeah why
where's the happiness question where's
the joy question where's the balance
quotient whereas there's so many other
questions and i'm not talking about
nirvana i'm not talking about buddhism
i'm not talking about i'm not talking
about meditation just the because at
some stage when you have this kind of
acuteness
you're going to need balance at some
stage
because do you really want to test the
pulse on your body and the calories that
you burn every single day of your life
you know because at some stage the penny
is going to drop did that make me happy
that i was so you know willpower is a
very difficult thing for a lot of people
and it's great the people who have
willpower and i think at leadership you
need that kind of willpower right
because you need that willpower to get
up at 4 30 in the morning still continue
at regiment routine 99 of the people who
say i travel 10 days is the month i
can't keep my can't keep myself fit but
the people who have a willpower will
find themselves so that's a very strong
anchor but i would say to this you there
are two three things here one is
validate that after five years and see
how many people continue to do that
second wealth is not the only benchmark
and third is if you're so obsessed i
think you need to take a reality check
can you be obsessed for 20 years ago i
don't think so
that makes sense because it's
periodically uh relevant for some people
at some stage as much as a sprint versus
a marathon yeah as much as 100 meters
versus 500 meters and whatever else yeah
and you know we we overestimate when we
achieve something we tend to look back
and try to connect dots and overestimate
uh like you know we we give more
importance to certain things because we
are going through that phase it why do
we give more importance i think we give
more credit to ourselves
that's true 99 so i was i just said it
yesterday uh this is a belief there's no
math behind it and there's no signs i
just believe that 99 of his serendipity
like luck one percent is your
manufactured luck right yeah yeah and by
manufacturing luck i mean strong
believer in serendipity i wouldn't put
99 or 90 i put it at 50 okay because if
it's 99 or 90 also then you are you
might as well sit down and chill and let
the breeze blow but it may blow you in
different directions yes but if you
really want to catch serendipity then
you need to be out there in multiple
places so that when the wind catches you
you know when to ride on the sale and
when to walk in the trenches fair i know
that's what i'm saying if there's no
match to it i just believe that it's a
combination
but it needs to have a slightly more
balance than saying i'm around now come
hit me from the back true that makes
sense okay quick question what do you
think like what makes what's the
difference between successful
entrepreneurs and versus people who kind
of quit on just the entrepreneurship
journey after a while i would not call
them unsuccessful entrepreneurs well i
can like people who make it versus the
people don't make it and the judgment
criteria can be wealth happiness impact
anything i'm just saying like people who
make it yeah i would answer this very
directly because i think the question is
a very relevant and important one
the people who haven't made it there is
no category like that because actually
that's not a category so it's not that
i'm comparing it to but but the
difference between somebody who made it
and somebody who called it a day because
there's no such thing as i didn't make
it yeah it only means you call it a day
and therefore the difference between the
two is you didn't stick it out
you didn't stick it out because if you
stuck it out you wouldn't be in this
category that you have self it's a
self-claimed category it's not a
category that is a category
i didn't make it there is no such
category
i didn't stick it out that's a category
i copped out that's a category there's
no question about the fact it may not be
the success you planned it to be but the
fact is that the people who got it
because they eventually became
successful
okay so if you ask me which of my
journey whatever else is because it's
that's the journey and you're eventually
and then eventually becomes a new
benchmark and okay there's a certain
benchmark for which you feel you may not
fall but you could so that is a
progressive one but the people who did
not make it
open the category that doesn't exist but
it's a self-made category called i
didn't make it because i don't think
anyone should sit in that category says
i didn't make it
why
of course you may fail you may have got
bankrupt
would have happened to you lots of
things may have happened in man at that
particular point your life is over your
career is over your reputation may be i
don't mean reputation as in you did
something and you know it was crooked so
without ethics your reputation of a
failure those are this those will fly
out of the window in one minute so i
think that category should be mixed
don't you feel like there are people who
are not cut out for certain things
some people should not be an
entrepreneur and they're trying to
become entrepreneurs or some people
should not be working so then it's not
that they didn't make it they tried
something and they made the wise
decision that i need to go back into a
cry into my into a zone which i know is
going to be my security zone like i
think taking risks or working and taking
that responsibility is not my best i
perform better when i'm part of a
overall support system that doesn't mean
you didn't make it as an entrepreneur
you did that and then you took a good
call that says for good reason not
because i failed not because i didn't
make it so and i'm trying to dissect
this here because i think i've lived all
of those journeys enough to be able to
dissect that and say very clearly don't
go do it because if you think i'm gonna
i have the option to go back to a job
you will if you start on your journey
and i think you asked me in the very
beginning whatever one or two things
that i started for my early childhood
and i said one is you know you're on
your own and the second is you don't
have a choice so if you ask me today
given that i had zero opening bank
balance and didn't have money like
everybody else thinks today is their
birthright that i want to start a
business and let somebody funds me
today at that stage there was no such
thing it was the reverse of that so for
the next 10 years not having any fiscal
support but still building something you
go with the fact that i don't have a
choice you have won multiple hats okay
there's a media company and then there's
at tech and then there's multiple things
that the sports franchise right like
everything you've done and you have you
have tasted success in like multiple of
them
after lots of failures but of course we
will come to feel this i'll come to that
but i want to understand like
you know there are people who are really
good at one thing but when they try to
get out of their zone of like a level of
expertise they kind of fail in like
other things right so what do you think
like what
what makes somebody or what are the
fundamentalists what is that one thing
or two things which make someone
successful in like multiple things yeah
because it's so difficult to succeed
like some domain expertise and figuring
that out i mean the first is the
supposition that i was a media expert
when i decided to start media i wasn't
right i mean again that was serendipity
okay that got me there the day on which
i said i want to start something was not
the day i knew i wanted to start
something in media or at the time in
which i started it there was no words
and vocabulary like media and
entertainment but now the world
describes your like media expert and all
of that at that stage it wasn't the case
right but i used to do a lot of weekend
as a hobby weekend theater
uh i used to do frontal camera hosting
for do darshan at that particular point
in time so why and how those are all
desperate to get pocket money and
theater was something i came not having
from a lower middle class house not
having uh too much of education so soft
skills for me were very important and
theater debate elocution helped me there
so i think those were the early years
when i felt wow i'm having fun and i'm
earning pocket money to go out on a date
i mean that was real pocket money it was
like 250 rupees on a weekend of 500
rupees on a weekend kind of situation
but enough for you to be able to move up
in your lifestyle and not go home and
ask your parents for even 50 bucks at
that particular point in time so
it was great fun and i so my first part
of my career was not because i was i had
an inkling towards media and
entertainment but because i was exposed
to it and then i said why don't i make a
business of it
so i think that's that's kind of how it
works i mean i think if i went forward
to so i think domain expertise
um when you're on a job you know when
you've taken engineering or technology
that's a good one but that doesn't mean
today you need to be a specialist only
you can be a generalist so all i'm
saying is people can do something great
for the entire part of their career i'm
sure if you're a great lawyer the
probability of you switching and saying
i want to be a doctor for the rest of my
life is not gonna it's not gonna work so
there'll always be those examples right
but a leader in a oil rig company can
become a ceo of a media company
why because both are equal in terms of
their probabilities of success you'll
drill 100 times and have three times
when the oil will hit the ground right
i'm just saying it as a yeah so it's
about how you how you build the
organization how you look at your if you
understand consumer if you understand
consumers you understand trends you can
actually transcend many many sectors
okay we'll come to consumer trends
because that's my favorite favorite
favorite area but speaking on the topic
you said about taking risk on
entrepreneurship right in as an
entrepreneur or as a job as an employer
as anyone you need to take risk in order
to go ahead
there was a very interesting quote which
i heard it says getting rich is about
taking a lot of risk with small amount
of money and staying rich is a lot about
taking small risks with lots of money
and to me that was like super
interesting but
when you think about it what essentially
the court is trying to say is take
calculated risk at any point of your
life right and you believe in that like
every entrepreneur should keep taking
risk and but what's the right way to
take a calculated risk yeah so firstly i
mean risk is a very subjective word
right because it really the most
important part of a risk is your own
appetite your own appetite not just
financially your own appetite mentally a
lot of people think you know because can
you have the shock absorbers to take
whatever because if you are resilient it
doesn't make a difference where the
financials will come from that'll get
could get figured out in most spaces if
you have the mental aptitude for it for
risk it will work very differently
to the quotes that you just mentioned i
think my ratio of success to failure is
about eight failures to two successes
so let me explain my formula if not my
quote because i do believe that in and
this is evolved over a period of time
it's not a strategy that i've walked
into
but at the stage where i walked in with
a dna that says what have i got to lose
in a snakes and ladders game i'm still
in the game even if i go from 97 down to
six because it's still six it's not zero
okay so what's my worst case i'll go
down to six but i'm still in the game
and i don't know i might still go up
there because there's there's ladders to
climb and snakes to slip down from so i
think my ratio is that when i take the
risks
the outcome or the failure is a 1x it
could be i invested 10 crores and it was
a write-off or i hired somebody who's a
right offer i started a business and
it's a writer but whatever that is it's
a finite zero sums game
but when you're taking those kind of
risks on a sustained basis and i don't
mean risk just for the sake of taking
risks but if you've got these
opportunities the probability of you
having a 40x 50x or 60x gain versus the
3x or a 4x gain in the things that
really work you're setting yourself up
for that
and that's what worked for me as a
formula that while they're enough of the
minus one x's but if two of them are 30x
that's 60. and 60 minus 8 is 52.
that could be 32 but it still won't be
two two yeah and i think
now it's not just a mathematical
equation and it's not about only monies
it could be as i said one could be a
decision about personal one could be a
decision about people one could be a
decision about exiting something before
it's time giving up on something before
it's time all of those are one x's but
because you're moving your journey along
with that that in mind
your probability of high success versus
good success is really where wealth
creation happens okay you talked about
consumer trends all right and i want to
know that because he said like you can
actually win at a lot of things in the
business world in different arenas as
well if you know how to spot consumer
trends okay so give me like what do you
feel what's the trend in india right now
sure firstly to spot it you need to be
in it right you need to be in the you
need to walk the talk you need to be
doing that you need to be open to the
fact most people are not necessarily
open to the fact they'll take a consumer
research or they'll take a focus group
they want to do it because it's a tick
in their book but actually they're
saying yeah yeah i think what he wanted
to say was this and what no no he's
saying three different things from what
you set out to do in that context so i
think you need to be kind of open to
that
the second part i think is especially my
media days and today even in in upgrad
and what we're doing in in skilling
basically
my next 15 years is about preempting
careers of tomorrow it's about seeing
how soft skills can become super skills
for people making them understand that
just a formal degree is fantastic but
it's not the be all in end-all and that
every single day every three years the
good news is and the bad news is that
when you throw up your graduation cap
and you thought you were done you're not
done anymore
so when you're looking at that and
you're preempting it you need to
understand what's in people's mind right
because i may say here's a career of
tomorrow but the fact is the matter is
that that person may not feel the
agility for it and how do you get them
and therefore understanding what the
consumer what's my messaging to them to
pinch them to make them feel that hey
hey you need to upgrade and one of the
examples and we have a great university
here as part of upgrad which is at bkc
and we had a class of about 35 40 of
them that were in a room and i came in
there and i brought the head of kpmg and
the head of uh mckinsey there and they
were talking about careers of tomorrow
like here's you know i mean as normal
consultants everyone talks about here's
what i think is going to be there and
the kids there said actually we are here
to tell you what the careers of tomorrow
are we don't want to hear from you what
you think they are because actually
we're going to make the careers of
tomorrow it does make a difference
whether you think this is what it is and
this is the future we know what we want
to do for the next 30 years of our life
and that's going to be the careers of
tomorrow and when you take that insight
that one insight
i'm sure those two people walked away
from there saying i better shred half my
reports out there because if i don't if
i'm telling people what they need to be
prepared for without listening to what
they think they want to do for the next
30 years which is going to give them
maximum of joy excitement to do i'm
missing the boat
so that's my best example i can give you
of why it is absolutely important how
you do it
and you need to and i think for me the
best mix today is
i'm i'm involved with storytelling by
making movies so you have to understand
what audiences are looking for just in
every sense of the word why they want to
go to the cinema what do they want to
tell in stories what's the genre what's
it this and then in education what they
want to do with their careers and
work-life balance and if you put all of
that together and if i do a webinar with
5000 of our alumni on a sunday i get
more insights with the questions they
ask than having five boardroom or
meeting room conversations there so it
just depends on how you're open how you
process that information and we know we
spoke a little bit about data earlier on
but data without understanding how
you're gonna
place it in context is very very
important a little bit like i had this
conversation and you know it was so much
gold there but no it may be gold to them
how am i gonna make it platinum or gold
or silver is up to me
so these are three different lives
you're talking about in three different
things right one is the media and the
stories part i'll come to that the other
was a work-life balance that is a
different part and third was how do you
take people's feedback and then kind of
backward engineer and try to build
things between but i do want to say that
all of three amalgamate because if i
want to figure out the consumer of
tomorrow what is their wallet share why
you are spending only 20 on
entertainment three years back and now
you want to make it forty percent of why
you're spending three percent on
education and why you're spending 20 now
all of this you'll need all this
information but we can still break it up
but i'm saying understanding the
consumer to understand because you asked
me the first question on this was what
do you think where do you think
consumers are and what are they looking
for so therefore a lot of that is what
is their wallet share like if you are
100 bucks what would you spend it on if
the if the if the if if my if my
community the village where we work for
example if we had 100 bucks so share 100
bucks what would she work what would the
mother do what would the daughter do
what would the son who migrated to
mumbai from liger do all of these are
very different questions for different
people
oof okay and all right will we come to
this okay interesting take on wallet
share because and give me your take on
this okay i read a report recently uh it
was done by like obviously consultants
and stuff like very named i don't want
to quote them because it might change so
54 percent what they said that our
parents generation used to save 54 of
their income yeah okay and our
generation only sp only saves 17 of
their income yeah so that's a huge
difference like there's like 30 35
percent which people are spending now
more than saving yeah so where do do you
like you have read the wallet share and
you understand that much better where do
you feel like the consumers of today or
the today's generation is spending the
mindset has changed right i mean the
fact of the matter is when you ask your
parents and they've got a bank balance
you say mom dad why don't you go to
nainital and have a holiday
you know what will happen to me so
they're thinking of that negative
tomorrow you're thinking of the positive
tomorrow
today i have to live so that mindset has
changed a lot and that is a that's not
wallet share that's behavioral pattern
that's pending pattern that's everything
you want to do and a lot of that is
because of the media the social media
the interactiveness and the peer-to-peer
pressure that you get today that they
didn't have so that to me is the is the
one where somebody is looking that
tomorrow i need to make provide for
tomorrow and you're saying
yeah
that's true i'm little i'm still in the
middle of it i am sometimes
they're still spending by the way i want
to tell you that's slightly better than
some nations where that 50 is all debt
yeah
yeah but that's what i'm saying so you
take here this is the psyche and
actually it's a good indian psyche from
that point of view but if you take a
western country take america their
pocket share is not 100 bucks is 400
bucks their pocket shares three thousand
bucks for 100 bucks because you can
mortgage your flat you can do this you
can take on debt everything is on that
basis right so then you're leveraging
is very different and you're leveraging
at 0.25 interest where in india we've
grown up on 8 to 12.5 interest for
example then everyone's mindset your
parents mindset whatever else is there's
a value for money um
but and that doesn't mean i'm saying
america is a less value for money but
it's just a very different way so wallet
share in each country when you're
looking at a consumer you'll have to see
which consumer the guy in vietnam the
person in india the person in bangladesh
the person u.s the person in ukraine
very different you know what and you
know we tend to yeah i'm having so many
different questions and now not
completing the last one but i'm still
going to ask
so what do you feel like what everybody
we look at western cultures we look at
western world and the startups which
have worked there right and we try to
copy that here that's terrible right but
i've never done that in my life and i
don't know why people do that but i want
to just caution you what you read about
in the media is that small minority of
people that actually look at that but if
you see the people that are out there
and some of the entrepreneurs the sme
sector the small and middle those are
making manufacturing if somebody's
working in climate change or they're
working in agriculture they're working
those are all those are all
non-copy-based so it's a homegrown but
ninety percent of business ideas today
on a cumulative basis not basis on how
they're funded by nine crazy vc and
private equity investors who want to
just throw money on people the other
people they when you don't have that
kind of money you come up with better
business models some few investors have
decided to over value you i mean
anything nothing can go to that level no
mercury rises in such a sudden manner so
i think that was a phase there was a
phase of zero cost of capital there was
a phase in that that report card changes
very very quickly i don't think we
should use that as the gold standard or
is that as the benchmark for anything
from that point of view i mean i've said
it before and i'll say it again you know
from the maybe 100 unicorns today i
don't think the out of these hundred
more than 25 will be unicorns in the
next two to three years there might be
another x number of unicorns i'm sure
we'll have many many who will have the
right value but they'll have built a
much more business but today i think a
lot of fragility in the in in the
valuations that have happened there and
for all good reason we know that we know
the reason why it's happened so we
should not we should really be cautious
that they should not become the
inspiration for all your listeners and
viewers here also today because actually
that's a bad example to follow
and look i mean i think upgrad is in
that category but i i kind of cringe
because i'm just saying we went about
what we went about the first five years
we funded it ourselves and then we went
through with that process but this gold
standard that we put on this self
acclaimed back thumping chess thumping
approach because five people backed you
at a certain valuation and you manage
that your problems are all starting now
there's a statutory warning
your problems start now after getting
that that decision because now where you
go now where do you go where you go from
here
now you've got to build solid where you
go from here 25 sure out of the 100 yeah
i would say the rest where you go from
here
um
yeah for the and that's not a model then
let's keep that out and then when we
talk about the real india or the real
opportunities even the real anywhere
from that point of view or the real
vietnam or the real china or the real
any economy or the real africa i mean
yeah there's a lot happening true that
that is i'll come to that the india
story right and first i want to complete
the last question was
where do you feel like the
today's customer is spending on like
what do you think where are we spending
the most the year generation is it
entertainment is education like where
are we spending the most yeah so i mean
my broad and i'm not an economist so i'm
not coming i'm giving i'm giving a very
down-to-earth person to person as as a
customer nice i can see that the
self-consumption is gone up and i say
self-consumption and then can have many
rules in that so for some people i think
the whole element of what i would call
for yourself is a combination of
entertainment recreation outdoor
activities something that you want to
consume in that thought process
lifestyle approach what you spend so
there's a whole consumption pattern on
self whether it could be an expensive
phone because it's you're spending six
hours a day or three hours a day on it
to lifestyle to how you want to dress
and do whatever else to what you want to
consume in every sense of the word and
recreation i think today more and more
people have spent more money on that
the savings part i think is the one that
is shrunk because you do believe rightly
so i think and in india that tomorrow is
going to be better than yesterday and i
think when you ask for that generation
maybe your parents at that stage grew up
where tomorrow may not be as good as
yesterday yeah and then you have a very
cautious approach to life so it's not
that they were born pessimists but it's
just that you felt i have to save for a
rainy day today i don't think that's the
first thing you think of a rainy day
you know part of it is also because you
have a lot of self-confidence today in
in in young india like i'll manage i'll
figure it out
at that time you didn't feel you had to
figure it out that's why my dad said and
tell me but you are on your own yeah
because he didn't think that there would
be but at that stage in age i felt i'll
figure it out true so that's why my
ability to take risks so my spending
part of 100 wallet will be on great
ideas it may not be necessarily on my
self-consumption the t-shirts and the
trousers i wear i buy 10 of each and
then wear them for 10 years okay so it's
the easiest decision for shopping and is
the easiest decision every morning for
wearing your clothes right so i think
it's each one to their own but still
it's self-consumption it is
self-consumption but it is because you
believe tomorrow is yes better than is
going to be better than today and i
think some of the other earlier and you
know i i'm not saying i mean i mean that
generation where i feed young but i'm in
an older generation so i i feel i can
relate to both where i do believe
tomorrow is better than yesterday and i
think and spend accordingly um yeah
because you know you you're right you
could have seen my father from like the
best thing happened to me was like i saw
my father grew building okay i i was
born at the time when we were not doing
very well financially and then
eventually i saw that whole struggle
like up and down up and then and then
eventually started doing better right
but even today his entire life is about
my choti's mom
right his whole life is i've never heard
him saying okay let me go take a it's
like a holiday yeah let me go spend on
myself let me buy something because i
like it yeah okay and whereas we i make
like friends
not from an indulgent or not lack of
indulgence point of view he might think
it's worth it to take all of you all for
a holiday yeah yeah okay but now you are
not willing to go for a holiday then his
mind will change overnight on that
yeah that's true okay and coming to the
next topic okay that was about education
and because i have my own courses as
well i have my small university called
figuring out university where we teach
people lot of how to become content
creators how do you expand your
businesses through social media and
stuff like that right and there's
something i came to
a realization because i used to talk
about public speaking as well and i i
used to have courses on public speaking
and stuff right and correct me if i'm
wrong
india specifically this is what the
pattern of scene
india spends very high when there's a
promise of jobs of jobs yeah well of
jobs or the money or something in return
like there's a promise a certificate
which can get them a better job right
they spend very less on soft skills yeah
right they and then they spend like
extremely low on something which is just
for passion yeah so the highest is
something which is rewarding them
instantly yeah second is passion and
third is something which is just like
yeah so do you feel that that's true i
think that's a very good categorization
but bottom line is it's not about
whether see firstly education is a very
evolved word because education is a
talented event now in your life which is
school in college so the minute you say
education sounds like i'm going back to
a place to learn and i think today
people are understanding that education
is a lot more it's a lifelong learning
process or a learning process or
skilling process or an upgrading process
there you're right that for a lot of
people see in a developing country or
even even though we're going to be one
of the three largest economies we're
still in many ways developing even
though we're not a category of a
developing country in india but in that
category you are looking at where 90 of
the people do want some sense of instant
gratification there's low roi on soft
skills because it's not an immediate
yeah you know in the heart of heart that
they are if i could just do this this
actually i just finished interviewing
for a job but if i i don't think the
connection is that if i knew my soft
skills i would be able to get 80 better
marks just because i presented myself
better rather than i knew everything i
needed to do to go into our interview so
today it's a lack of knowledge that you
feel because soft skills is the most
important i'm a product of soft skills
yeah i'm not a product of half skills i
did my become and then i moved on to
being an entrepreneur so everything that
i've done since that not having had
funding for 10 years not having had
recourse is about my own self-confidence
then my ability to communicate and i
wasn't born with that right i mean it
was something that i inculcated i
realized the power of soft skills more
than anything else and therefore i'm a
preacher of that i'm an evangelist in my
second book i did was really about
saying how important soft skills is and
i think for a lot of people they don't
see the immediate roi
they feel but actually that is going to
be 10 times more critical today in this
field of education and i think what
you're doing here around this show
people want to absorb that today they
want to feel okay so i need that two
three things they might listen to us for
45 minutes they just need to get two
points out of it nobody needs to get 40
points out of it we've talked about an
array of things and i know you might say
we've talked about lots of things in
this too much but actually what i want
to do is if two people if one person has
two things to take away from it superb
true now that in that context what they
take will be something that will give
them that level of clarity and
confidence to put into life so i think
soft skills is underrated but it's very
very very critical i've started calling
it super skills because soft sounds soft
yeah but super sounds like shaktimaan
and nice i like that so i think we
should all because we're going to be a
superpower and i think we should just
call it super skills because actually
it's going to give you super powers and
you're going to be a superhero if you
can just get your soft skills into some
super skills and look there are 60 soft
skills you just need to know two pick
your two not everything is about you
being able to be a creative person or an
articulation or english language yeah
hindi language
i think it's about any two things that
you think will make you stand out is
what you need to pick and then just
focus on them just curious question from
an entrepreneur what's the difference
between upgrad versus all the other
attack companies you know
yeah so i mean
the way i see it is
our vision is a much more integrated
approach right i mean i'm saying
somebody may just want to give college
degrees somebody wants to do a boot camp
somebody wants to do just job enabled i
think what we have and this is my media
upbringing and the way i've started a
media company i'm a firm believer that
scale in a country like india or in when
you want to build a global company which
i think we want to do uh is to have
something integrated which means you
take everyone postcode k12 which is a
college learner all the way till 65 and
look at all their needs and i think
that's a differentiator today where some
people are doing uh study abroad some
people are doing transnational education
some people are doing only boot camp
some people are doing formal degrees
some people doing undergrad degrees some
people have only offline and online
blended i think our ability is to do all
and i think reflecting back uh when i
started off and finally made a media
business and i think the reason we stood
out and created value was because we
were not just a content creator we were
not just a production house but we have
10 broadcast channels yet we understood
content and created for many people yet
we were a movie studio we were an
animation studio in a production house
so it was all very much part of media it
wasn't some diversified salt to steel
kind of definition it was a very
connected approach to creativity and and
being a catalyst but in an area where
when something went down something would
go up and i think that makes a you know
more like an aircraft carrier so i see
ourselves more as a flotilla or as a
sort of an armada of ships rather than
just having one one aircraft carrier
because sometimes once that hit then
it's hit
and where do you which one is your
favorite or where do you see the most
traction out of all the things that you
provide
so at upgrade i i'm fascinated by the
fact that i think the future of learning
tomorrow is going to be a lot more about
peer-to-peer learning and i know that
most people said when you build brick
and mortar curriculum is important
follow the rules important and faculty
is important and faculty is definitely
important but we're not going to be able
to solve the faculty problem in india
because it is but peer-to-peer learning
today is becoming today as it's like
anything else right when you want to
consume you don't want to see a
marketing ad anymore you want to see
what 40 other people who experienced it
went through that yeah so that whole
element of study groups and peer-to-peer
learning is something that we're
cannibalizing and second i think that
the umbrella of the future of learning
is coaching and mentoring and i don't
mean one-on-one coaching or even what
we're doing here it's just the element
of permanent coaching and mentoring if i
look at these two umbrellas i think
that's a guiding force for everything
that we're building for the next 10
years what do you feel like how is what
do you understand about indian consumers
like give us some consumer insight which
you feel like oh indians are different
in this way if i'm an entrepreneur is
there something i should know about
india very well or something diversity
diversity of culture diversity of needs
diversity of spending and i think you
can look at that in the largest common
denominator you're going to look at it
in the top of the pinnacle there's so
many different markets that you can play
with here both from a taste point of
view consumption point of view uh ethnic
point of view habits point of view
family vanish values point of view or
patriarchical society versus a
matriarchical society versus just a very
democratic society the whole younger
generation this to me this thing of
tomorrow is better than yesterday
psychology is a very very haunting one
to me it's it's haunting well i like the
word haunting because it's like you know
then there's it's in the room it's
omnipresent and you should it's
something you need to take into account
because when you have that sentiment and
if you can create that sentiment it's a
it's a minds it's a mindset change
moment if you do believe that and it's
something for you to introspect
do i really believe tomorrow is better
than yesterday every day tomorrow is
going to be better than yesterday okay
and that if you look at it it sounds
like it's just a nice simple firmly
optimistic believing sentence but you
need to actually change your mind and
believe in that and you'll find
behavioral patterns
in a very different manner your answer
to work life balance will change your
answer to so many other things that you
angst are angst about may go away what
do you look in a movie before you invest
in it so firstly i don't think i i if i
have an investment mindset i'll crash
and burn what kind of movies you create
do you feel like oh this is gonna work
in the movie i think i understand
consumers and i keep wanting to
understand consumers in a different
manner number one number two i want to
be true to storytelling in the way i
want to necessarily do it because what
is that like what do you understand
about consumers yeah so obviously today
more than ever before outside the fact
that this is an entertainment sector i
think people definitely want a certain
sense of context and a certain sense of
realism so i think the movies we've made
versus see i came from the outsider so
being an outsider to me the song dance
family approach and you know everything
goes and either that or the dishum
dishum or just hardcore nonsensical but
it works in a hardcore leave your brains
behind yeah i can't relate with that i
wouldn't be able to make it better and
only make it worse so i stayed out of it
so then therefore from my early days
whether it was for days or whether it
was rang de basanti those were the
breakout stories that appealed to me
right and i guess maybe to that extent
in those early days i do believe that i
was part of the formula that allowed it
to happen maybe if i hadn't backed it
maybe somebody else would not have
backed it and therefore it may not have
happened but being the outsider gave you
the sense that if i stay with my values
now i was not doing it saying i want to
talk about an audience that i don't know
exists i don't make movies myself
because if i did i would not make 99 of
the movies that i would make because
what i want to see if i want relaxing
versus what i want to see from what i
want to do as a passion are two
different things so to me i think
getting the message across having a
sense of realism that doesn't mean that
everyone should do that but i'm saying
there's so many people doing the other
stuff in any case that one more person
doing that doesn't make any sense so
that's my way of storytelling now when i
was running it as a business to what i'm
doing today with rsvp as a passion are
two different things and the reason is
when you're running a business 50 60 of
your decisions are what you have to do
yeah and 40 what you want to do when
you're doing a passion 100 percent
better be what you want to do and
nothing that you have to do because it's
a matter yeah you don't have to do so
you don't have to get up in the morning
and play golf you don't have to go to
the swash court you don't have to play
chess or whatever else you want to do so
that is a very liberating sense of being
able to then do what you want to do
because you can say no 99 times when
you're running a business you can't say
no 99 times a lot of people are doing
what they used to do in bollywood and
divi that's the reason why it's
struggling right now or because or is it
just because of ott and the south cinema
has gotten like super successful has
always been around and they tell great
stories yeah but they're just looking
much better and shining much better
because of the simple reason that
they're doing exactly what they were
doing and staying focusing on it
innovating and doing it better so yes i
think here because you you talk about
like sense of realism right like in so i
don't want to be judgmental but i think
we've taken our audience for granted
here and i think that's the problem
right and we haven't made the change and
even the main problem is when you're an
insulos industry and i'm not saying we
necessarily are and i don't want to be
critical because i'm very much part of
it i'm very proud of it because the
creative industry does have a strong
impact but when you are insular and when
you're clannish
you just say the same thing again and
when you're you're with people who
finish the sentence for you is the most
dangerous place to be in
because of every meeting somebody can
finish the sentence for you or going out
saying see all right what a culture
whatever it's so nice we're all we're
all so hum uh sorry where's the
diversity and what's going on outside
and how do you gonna figure this part
out and who's going to challenge you and
then you're then you're in your own
world and you're in la la land funnier
in your own world then you're in a la la
land and then you're irrelevant
hmm
it's not because of ott or the world or
it's just about
we're not being though those changes
will be there in any case but thank god
for ott right thank god for ott because
the simple reason that good creative
people are getting an opportunity to
write even better scripts for a much
wider audience and what you've done is
now an audience has actually got used to
a different level and of of storytelling
and now finds it very difficult to just
be in suspension of reality
or look at a star because the context of
star and actor and larger than life has
also changed for a lot of people right i
mean in the younger generation complete
iconic situations are very different a
20 million uh you know tick-tock view a
viewer is is very different than 20
millions of twitter with an actor coming
to the last topic of the day why do you
feel like giving back is really
important
because and at the youngest as well like
yeah i think that was my balance i think
it's a root sometimes and i think for a
lot of people who feel uncomfortable in
their work-life balance therefore
they're feeling unsatisfied with their
life in some form or the other and i
know i'm i'm not trying to be a mockery
because there are people who are
thinking they are between the two hours
it's so easy for you to do but i commute
to ours each day each way then i come
home and fact out my family my kids i
don't see them growing up i'm being made
to travel those are ground realities i
fully get that but you can manage a fair
bit of that is what i think you can be
at least 50 in the control of your
destiny giving back is a very powerful
medium and i think it gave me a lot of
balance because at that early age and i
don't know why it's a little bit like i
wanted to be an entrepreneur i didn't
know what i want to do i became
something in media and entertainment as
i gave you because of serendipity of
doing theater and whatever else the same
way i don't know why but when you know
when we started something my first thing
was that you know about 10 of what we do
we'll do for giving back and at that
stage again with no balance
the for me we are at 10 000 square foot
office that we had rented and at one
thousand square foot of that we started
the old age home a little bit of a crash
and an orphanage kind of situation and
that was extremely binding because
nobody went home at 6 37 everyone would
you had 30 people in the people all 30
people gravitated that until 8 9 10
because suddenly it was a different part
of them and i saw the culture building
in an organization at that very early
stage but i wanted to do that so i think
this thing about i can't make a
difference singularly which i think
today the generation feels i think is
wrong and i know that when we did in
2006 and i remember amir rakesh and me
going to delhi university and they were
you know in that large quadrangle there
were almost 10 000 students and after
the screening and they said sir this is
nice because you know it's a the heroes
die at the end and whatever else and but
there but the cry at that time was
i can't make a difference yeah it's okay
you can make this statement before using
yeah you think i can make a difference
and i think that's changed today where
people do feel singularly we can make a
difference and i think
in the giving back individuality is very
very important it's not about money it's
about the mindset of that balance
and i think you'll get your work-life
balance because if you're slightly more
blessed than the next person you'll you
look at life in a very different
perspective and i've come from a lower
middle class household so i can identify
with that journey that i've taken that
at every stage if i look back over my
shoulder and say ready but if i've come
here what about this person and hey you
know what about that person or
i was privileged in the last five years
of my life to go to a good school like
cathedral but before that i went to an
even good school called dunn's institute
right where it was it was a challenging
environment then today i still sponsor
at least about seven to ten kids from
that institution but that's just because
you're looking over your shoulder so i
think it's not a categorization and i
feel sure there are enough people who
say make a pledge i think that's all
fine and it's nice because maybe bill
gates and buffett have at least made
philanthropy a little bit more high
profile but i'm not it's it's a very
personal thing but i would say for
everyone in the younger you can do your
balance it gives you a very strong
purpose even if it's ten percent it's
like your wallet share in that wallet
share you don't need to spend one rupee
of it but take 10 of your mind share and
it'll make a big difference
so it's either you give back via time or
you give back via wallet chair or like
money my daughter runs a mentor mentee
program with about 700 called the
lighthouse project and i've spoken to a
lot of people in the you know they're
they're young professionals or
college-going kids who adopt a kid and
you need to spend about a day a month
with that and actually most of them
spend much more but the impact it's had
on the mentors is more than it's had on
the mentees
so i think it's a strong message for
anyone wanting to look at a balance in
life forget work life balance mind
balance mind share balance very
important i see it's like self-help and
help others both the categories you
should be there yeah yeah that's what
mom says you know my mom says like you
guys keep reading about self-help
self-help self-help you need to have a
lesson in your life which says help
others absolutely like start reading
books you want to say in that early
stages while you may be helping somebody
else you are big time helping yourself
for the future
so introspect on the impact is having on
you also there is an roi for you not an
roi for somebody else when you're doing
that so be selfish when you're giving
when you're being something you'll get
you'll get a lot of self-conviction on
yourself and that you'll be able to
you'll just be able to you'll feel that
all right on that note thank you so much
thank you i think we are i think it
flowed yeah i think it was very natural
and obviously you have a lot of
curiosity that brought about a very
diverse set i didn't see you looking at
any notes ever it was more about
something you didn't ask about a lot of
stuff like so so many things but best
way for something is for the water to
flow yeah yeah thank you so much for
watching this episode till the end
please let us know in the comments if
you like this guest if you didn't like
the guest what question do you want us
to ask from the next guest which is
coming until the next episode keep
figuring out and don't forget to share
it with at least one person because
one conversation can give 100 ideas and
out of those 100 ideas if one can
implement even one in their lives then
their indian dream will come true
