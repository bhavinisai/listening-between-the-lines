[music]
[music]
[music]
this compared to this profile shot
[music]
but this is the final stage. [music]
[music]
[music]
hi, how are you? good. thank you.
>> thank you. [music]
>> okay.
>> so, she was telling me earlier,
>> put you under the bus. now, [laughter]
>> he doesn't speak much. you [music] also
don't speak much. [laughter]
>> i told you right. i predicted right.
[music]
>> when you speak tamil, i can understand
it cuz i'm also a south indian.
>> oh. and i have grown up all my life in
bangalore.
>> bangalore. so canada.
>> canada. yeah. half connecticut, half
kani. dad is from this town near udupi
called udyavar. and mom is from myo.
have you been to bangalore much?
>> yeah. yeah.
>> yeah.
>> 80s.
>> yeah.
>> quite a lot. used to work for canada
industry a little bit.
>> how is the canada industry?
>> canada industry is now rocking, right?
there was a dominant 20 years nothing
happened
>> after the grades
>> now they just leaped
>> i met uh i sometimes wish all of them i
call them zoom and
>> wish uh
>> they're doing much better
>> the music composer
>> and everybody
>> so you grew up in uh chennai most of
your life has been in chennai
>> most of the life in chennai yeah i was
born in chennai my father
yes he's used work in the studios
>> and then we we are in the belly of the
beast near kumbbakam.
>> okay.
>> our house where all the studios used to
exist.
>> yeah. so maybe we start by making you a
little bit awkward and getting you to
speak about your life so far. everybody
knows you and uh i'm a fan. i've heard
so many of your songs from different
eras and i love them. i wish i could
sing better and then i would have but i
can't.
>> my mother used to be a music teacher.
>> oh,
>> classical karnatic music. and they tried
to teach us everything. so i went to
classes for
uh guitar,
uh piano, flute, mandolin, everything.
>> but i discovered after much effort that
i have zero talent. [laughter]
>> no, it's not about talent. it's about
leaning in.
>> yeah.
>> never give up.
[music]
>> tell us a bit about your childhood. it
feels like you're a
or from what i've heard you were very
introverted.
>> yeah.
>> and now you're more open to speaking
because
as you have said your ability to
articulate has gone up significantly.
>> what changed? um
i think when i was growing up i was went
through all this the death of my father,
my grandmother
and then um conflicts
where
i was just seeing trauma every day like
my mother was a single very very
confident lady. she took all the pain.
>> at what age did dad pass away? um line.
>> mhm.
>> and she had to go through protect us
from and she was so strong that
withstanding all the kind of
humiliations she singly brought us up
right encouraging me to go into music.
she decided for me that i should be in
music. so i've tell that told that many
times and so in a way
i felt like i should be clean because i
had three sisters and
me behaving in a certain way would also
reflect what's coming back
and i was my whole childhood was with
40year-old and 50-y old 60-y old in the
studio
>> playing music
and
i missed all the fun with friends and
all that stuff at school. no college.
but
>> what year did you stop going to school?
>> 15, 16.
>> same actually. me also.
>> me also. school is not just about
education. it's about understanding
humanity. it's about
>> seeing each other and getting to know
the stories and learning things from
other kids. you know, their families are
different.
um
that i missed definitely. but then i i
got the i was with intelligent people in
the studios, great musicians in the
studio which also inspired me to reach
up to more musicality and play more
stuff. and
>> your dad was a successful
>> he was. so the story is like dad lived
in his uh in his house by the mother's
house and both mom and dad um their
clothes were thrown onto the streets
said get out of this house from his
family members.
so he had to go search for a house. so
he took a rented house and then to get
us a house he worked day and night
>> worked in three different places at the
same time. so that one story is that his
health went sec
>> because he anyway that's a dark
>> uh side of my childhood memory.
>> that's why i never speak up with my dad.
>> you have vivid memories of this age
night.
>> yeah.
yeah. i think uh after that to forget
what the trauma
took ages, right?
>> and has that memory changed? now it's
changed because i think it was such an
inspiration because every musician
came from his uh troop whether it's a
guitarist, a violin player or because he
had he had given so much work to the
musicians because he was working three
different places and everybody used to
adore him even if they're not talented
you'll but then you sit in the last row
take some money and go it would be good
for your family good for your education
even people like uh world class players
like el suburanium had kind words to say
he shared with me like a couple of years
back. so even now even today that
probably set the standard for me to
where i should head as a human being as
a successor to him. and now my nephew gi
prakash is shining got won the national
award twice.
>> he's a hero
>> and my son my daughters.
>> yeah.
>> and how did that change you? like my dad
passed away recently last year.
>> oh sorry. [snorts]
>> no. how does it affect you first and how
does it change you later?
>> it affects you because
that's the only thing you you have right
your parents.
>> um that's the only holding ground for
you the memories and what your dad is
what he represented or how he worked.
and um so to everyone your dad is your
first hero
>> right? your mother is the angel. m
>> who
was a safe place to go
>> the lap is the safe place to sleep and
that's why the respect for my mother or
my father is still there same thing. so
>> did the position of your mother in your
head change after your father's demise?
>> yeah my mother became like a
entrepreneur. she took the equence and
started renting it out. everybody
suggested that she should send
>> sell all the stuff put in the bank get
the interest and she said no no my son
will play
>> i'll keep my husband's stuff and then
she expanded she bought more keyboards
for rental
>> we used to rent it out for light music
for studios
>> so that was the income for like six
seven years and then that stopped cuz
everybody started buying the equipments
that's when she said now it's not going
to happen you need to go and play
>> the equipment rentals gone down and
>> and you started writing jingles
>> no i started playing keyboards for other
composers.
>> yeah.
>> like telugu composers, canada composers,
mr. raja,
>> um t rajander, masri,
>> raj koti,
>> like multiple composers like every day
there two songs.
>> every day they'll be like i go at 9:00,
i come back at 10:00.
>> and do they tell you what to play or do
you have to come up with?
>> yeah, they have to they will they'll
give the notes. but after a while, i
think when i bought my computer systems,
my
>> which is around 86,
>> i they gave me the freedom. they'll just
give me a melody and i say you arrange
it.
>> so i'd arrange all the stuff for them.
so that i got used to arrangement. but
they it was easier for me to arrange
then. they'll say, "okay, just do a
fight music." so i'll have to create a
fight music
>> with rhythm and large 2t bangs and stuff
like that. if you could pick one
instrument and never play another again,
which one would it be?
>> piano maybe.
>> yeah.
it's hard to travel with, right?
>> it is
>> like a guitar you can just carry.
>> no, but keyboard is like you can you can
have a smaller one,
>> right?
>> the electronic one,
>> right?
>> but having a piano i could only afford
after probably six, seven years of my
earning. then i bought a yamaha
and then now i have steinway and all
this stuff.
>> so for a few years you played with other
composers
almost 10 years.
>> 10 years and then they started first
telling you what you should play and
then allowing you your own compositions
or arrangement.
>> yeah.
>> and then
>> and then slowly went into jingles which
everything is mine. right. my
>> jingles you mean ads right?
>> ads. yeah. like in tamil.
>> no, i think jingles because most of the
agencies were international agencies
right on m hda.
>> uh they would do the scratches here and
they will throw that out and do it in
mumbai
>> and then after a time i think they
started agreeing they started putting my
stuff
>> they initially do scratches.
>> what is a scratch? scratch is a tune
where they just give it to the client to
say uh if it's a ointment or a paint and
they say okay this will work now go to a
bigger
>> jingle composter and get this.
>> so then that became like okay now this
itself is good enough and we can use it
>> right.
>> so that's the process.
>> when did it all change? when did it when
was that ah
>> 91? yeah,
>> i know actually magic happened when i
built my studio 89 pitan studio which i
have
>> is when i felt like empowered like i had
something which nobody had
>> which was
>> which my home studio
>> why did that change so much? many people
probably had access to a studio, right?
>> no, those days studios means like the
big halls where uh 90 people can play
together.
>> the the concept of home studio never
came.
>> so when i build my home studio is when i
realize like nobody will judge me
whether i do good music or bad music. i
can judge it myself and play the final
product. because in studios whatever you
play 50 other people are watching you.
if you you're bringing equipment,
they're all coming. oh, what is it? what
is the new stuff? m
>> how many people are going to lose jobs?
>> mhm.
>> so i was the gizmo guy, right? i used to
buy the computer.
>> so if i want to become a musician in my
life or if people watching want to
become a musician, what is that thing
they have to do now? like you got a
studio. is there some equivalent for
today?
>> you just have to practice. you just have
intention to learn. you can learn
anywhere now.
>> what if i'm already learned? like i'm
not not me because i have no knowledge.
but somebody who is a learned trained
musician.
>> you come to chennai, come to my
conservatory called k music conservatory
and join [laughter] there.
>> right. and there you will teach me how
to compose music.
>> everything any course like piano, voice
and yeah.
>> okay. so you started a studio at home
and then
>> and then i started experimenting my own
music which nobody heard. so manatam
came and i played them all
>> and he was quietly listening to all the
stuff. that listening session became the
dna for roa
>> and then roa changed everything
>> immediately.
>> yeah. overnight.
>> yeah. what year was this?
>> 91 i think. 91.
>> right.
>> so roa released and next day
>> roa released
>> people started treating you differently
altogether.
>> yeah. because he's one of the top
directors. every actor, every composer
wanted to work with him,
>> right? he's one of the top notch still i
feel like everybody is drooling over to
work with the money movie
>> whether it's a success or even the
process is so respectful
>> the same is true to for you you know
that
>> yeah absolutely oh me [laughter] okay
>> yeah and then everything changed people
around you treated you changed how did
you change
>> how did i change i was like okay this
will be the last movie i don't want this
i don't want movies because i've been in
movies and it's so boring but the money
at the movies are completely different
>> and he kind of listened to me like this
is what i want to do or i don't want to
do movies.
>> then i told him like i said i'm very
satisfied working with you. i don't want
to work with other people.
>> uh he said no no no you should work with
everyone. [laughter]
>> so i said i'm very happy working just
with you and i'll do jingles or i do
private albums. he said no you should
work with everyone.
>> and uh so my first 10 years was like
okay enough after this movie i'll leave
everything. m
>> i'll do my own stuff.
>> even movie was my own stuff but i
something non-film.
>> why do you think that was?
>> i don't know why i had this thing of
leaving everything.
>> is that because fear of disappointment
is?
>> no. no. i was resisting
uh
i resisting the the way the movie
industry was consuming because my father
was consumed right
>> after he passed away only couple of
people were there
>> and nobody else showed up
>> so that's when i like people have their
own lives then you realize they all have
their own lives
>> you were thinking this high will go away
>> not the high no i said like it is a
thankless any any industry it's it's not
a community
>> we just meet at studios very rarely do
musicians meet right [clears throat]
>> so after he passed away it is not a
government job there's no pension
nothing
>> right musician job i said if they are
like that we also have to be careful in
not giving every part of us to the
industry we should have soul left with
us so that i can do other things in art
>> do you still feel that way about movies
>> i always i always that's one of the
reasons why when other composers were
doing 30 movies a year. i felt i would
do two.
>> i started with two and then three and
then four. then became 12.
>> then i i escaped to resist uh people
coming to me. i went to england and sad
>> with hand lord weber doing bombay
dreams. the reason is to resist and grow
>> because i'm giving away all the stuff i
learned but i don't have anything new to
offer. i'll be thrown away. so it's
important to evolve artistically as a
musician composer is when i think the
the the foundation of what i'm doing now
is probably my time in london, my time
in hollywood,
>> not doing music, studying,
going for short courses,
you know, unconnected with music but
>> to understand art art in a very
different way.
>> that's crazy that you're still learning
to the day.
>> learning in the way because it you're
forced to learn. you buy a new rhythm
machine, you have to learn how
>> where the where to project load. most of
them are common,
>> right?
>> but even there
many stuff is changing right now.
there's granular synthesis, there's
algorithmic composition, there is um now
ai assisted editing
arrangements which all the masters have
done like bernstein
>> and gershwin
>> and john williams and
>> it's fascinating to see the older
um chaikoski or
>> mozard and there's always things to
learn
>> not to copy
>> but to understand the to speed up
orestation [clears throat]
>> and even studying songs about poetry
about metaphoricness about not straight
words but where it's hitting you
>> did you feel any impostor complex in
this period where you thought you were
undeserving of what you got and hence
yeah
>> always that's why i surrender
>> does this also translate into personal
life where you might spend a lot less
money than you can afford to
>> like
like say
as a very wealthy man you can afford to
live x lifestyle but you live 10% of
that or 20% of that.
>> my son is listening there. [laughter]
>> does he?
>> yeah. i think i think because it's not
that i'm not
uh i feel like if i can sustain like my
mother
god bless her um she used to give i on
friday she used to give
>> food.
so doing one thing
>> and for a certain number of people
choose to feed them.
>> we're still doing that.
>> she didn't feed on every day and on a on
a bad situation you cut all the stuff.
>> we're able to do that by the grace of
god even now.
>> that's consistently doing something good
for a longer time is better than doing
everything at the one time and then not
having money. so i believe that
consistency is very important your
lifestyle even whether you have money or
not
>> can be the same
>> um because when i was doing roa i didn't
have money for even putting petrol
>> because i was just doing that one movie
because i had to concentrate so much
>> there days where i didn't have my petrol
was i used to drive that time
>> was zero
>> and i felt like it's a good feeling
because you're sacrificing all that
stuff for the
>> believing in what you're doing right.
so it's important that even my children
realize like to be consistently in one
lifestyle that you can travel,
>> you can eat anywhere you want but you
don't
you don't want to show the whole world
like what you are and then it's it's a
fake um pompousness right
>> and anyway the in chennai i think it's
it's a city which makes you
>> be simple. m
>> it's not a unlike some other places
where they don't hug you and see what
you're wearing
>> the [laughter] back.
>> yeah. [snorts]
i would ask myself when i like delhi and
hyderabad are on one side and bangalore
and chennai are on the other side
of where [snorts] projections sit. so i
i would think why is it appealing to
bangalore and chennai to live under
their means and why is the opposite the
whole
showing living in the moment more
appealing to the
>> nothing wrong in i think it's the way i
think is consistency over years rather
than you know you can buy the best car
you can buy a bugatti you can be in the
best flat
but then ultimately where do you get the
happiness in the studio? so if you look
at my studio i have a the most expensive
piano, the most expensive mixer
>> but that's again helping me to serve
better
>> right? so it's a little old school but i
believe that
>> when i thought about this i i was
thinking about things like okay maybe
north india saw so much war so many
people invaded
people did not live for as long so they
lived more in the moment people in the
south have largely been
>> secure for a long period of time
>> nobody's secure
>> relatively
>> they have other tortures in life
>> yeah
uh it is a double-edged sword when when
we go out
it's important to present india in the
best possible way
>> because the whole world think india's in
poverty and this and that
>> i feel like india
the certain people are not in poverty
>> we probably have the richest indians
here
>> and it's important to represent the
country with dignity
>> to dress up to show that we are culture
people we have a great history and
culture in style and thing it's very
very important you don't want to show
them that very simple when when people
are judging you
>> you know as an indian i feel like i want
to be in the best representative the
best car outside where i i when i go and
i'm in la i have bentley
>> i lease a bentley so
>> i mean at least i had that time at least
right [laughter]
>> so
>> why a bentley van
>> because it's easy it's cheaper you have
to pay 110% duty here there you just
lease and
>> right but is you can get any car like
>> you can get
>> as an artist the style aesthetic of
bentley appeals most
>> not like that i because i never believed
in that and because it was so cheap
there
>> right
>> to to rent any car i said i had that
moment of 2 years
>> driving my kids around
>> hey come let's go and i have still have
videos of my son screaming when i'm
going fast sitting at the back
>> and you started driving when you were
really early and still enjoy driving do
you still drive
>> i do drive started driving again
>> i got my mahendra every car uh
>> and uh there i have uh
>> why mahindra electric cara?
>> i don't know. i just love it.
>> for the first time i felt like it's
world class quality and um i also worked
on it. i was also constantly suggesting
them do this to them
>> the sound system and we have some of the
best
>> my music sounds the best in that
the car.
>> yeah.
>> so you were part of the design.
>> i'm not getting paid for this. okay
guys. [laughter]
>> so it was like a hobby project. it was
something very different. i think
hanzimmer had done for bmw
>> and i mr. veu was the ceo like he came
in and
>> we had fun. yeah. yeah.
>> yeah.
>> and beyond roa and the initial success,
what happened after that also? were you
in some way on the cusp of a change in
trend of what kind of music was working
in india in the '90s? did you catch a
change in trend or did you create a
change in trend?
>> the trend happened because of rojo.
>> right. what was
>> there was a denial that oh this one last
and i think there's a denial constantly
for
>> what was the incumbent trend and what
was the change in trend? there was a
traditional kind of music which is
beautiful
>> like
>> the hindi composers were all there and
there's a beauty in it still but because
i'm not made of that my sensibility was
different because i was in a band i like
jazz i liked rock i liked uh you know uh
kowali i like karnatic i like hindustani
so my aspiration was very expansive
>> i didn't want to stick to
do and um mandolin kind of a this thing
i wanted to
because i could do it because i
>> i was now experienced in arranging for
other people and
>> also seeing the results and i had my own
studio
>> and i could uh get to the results faster
than imagining it without people judging
me.
>> so you changed that trend into roa kind
of music and how would you articulate
that? what was roa kind of music?
roa was very so my intention was when i
met manatam g i said when we are
listening to
pink floyd
>> queen
>> right
>> um john williams evangelist beatles
michael jackson
>> they don't listen to us right
>> so what's the reason
>> language production
and uh vibe feel recording
multiple things, right? so, i addressed
all this stuff. i was studying all the
stuff. i addressed all the stuff. i said
tamar song which we do here should go
and my if you look at my internet um
initial interviews, it says uh each
tamil [clears throat] song i do should
go around the world,
>> right?
>> and it was planned. it was i worked for
it. that's why i did less work and i had
to a lot of people thought okay this guy
is like very adamant and you know
snobbish not
>> my human limitations are i need time to
heal i needed time to listen to it i
need time to change i need to evolve a
song into what present shape it's not
like i could do a song three songs in
seven seven hours so
>> because i knew all the formulas
>> but
>> that's not what i wanted to do right.
>> i wanted to take it inch by inch to what
i felt would be the future of my sound
for the world.
[music]
>> indian classical music never had its day
under the sun per se. like at some point
rock music was cool. at some point jazz
was cool. at some point i'm saying
across the world in india obviously
bollywood is very very popular. we need
to position classical music in a very
higher
>> way. i think right now it's like i i
give this much money i can get a
teacher. no.
>> yeah.
>> getting a good teacher getting the they
say heart to heart transfer of knowledge
mindto mind transfer. no spirit not just
the knowledge of ragas but the spirit of
giving from a guru is only india sees
that it comes in you know the saints and
the sufis
uh is not just knowledge.
it's giving the prayer. the soul
actually wishes something, it manifests,
right? the product has to be truthful.
the product has to be sincere. when it's
sincere, they they grab it
because we look at all the the voice
talent shows, they pick the best
compositions usually. they pick because
it's tough to sing and it shows the
proess of the singer.
>> that's very important. so even that even
classical music the way
it's performed needs to change. it needs
to be more immersive
>> and that's what we're doing. i have a
band called jala which
>> mhm. and we're also floating a award
called the barat mastro award to find
the next zakir
>> next ravi shankar of course lord anushka
is there already for india we need to
find them and then nail them that these
are the mass roles of india
>> like recently i did a song called
muttamar in thug life
>> it's a very complicated song
>> they embraced it so much
>> embraced it and it became a talk of for
3 months they were talking about the
song
>> because it it has multiple ragas mixing
and going in and if we put our energy
and mastery in how we deliver the songs
to people definitely they'll like it. it
should not be the oh i'm giving you
classical music listen to it it's good
for you.
>> no give something good and make it
masterful
>> with the whole team like the dance and
creativity and everything
>> they will take it definitely. hey rama
>> it's a classical song.
>> the narrative is it's how you make them
feel. that's the most important thing.
>> like this decor
>> it feels very inviting.
>> yeah.
>> it feels very
>> uh it's welcoming. it feels like
somebody's
>> it feels lived in, right?
>> yeah, that's very important.
>> yeah, it's all from age old. like those
pillars are temple pillars.
>> that door is
>> from a temple chariot. they're all from
south indian.
>> i think you will also find it familiar
cuz it's largely south indian stuff.
>> yeah, i love south indian stuff.
>> yeah.
>> same with the peace garden. if you come
to peace, if you come to chennai, i'll
take you to
>> which is a combination of south indian
temple architecture, sophia
architecture, mix of all the stuff.
>> yeah. but indian art seems to be making
a comeback.
>> not enough i think.
>> no,
>> i think art should be taught artistic
view should be taught to the kids from
kindergarten.
>> the way they keep their houses, if the
every house in the street is kept well
clean, the street is going to look
beautiful. when i went to italy that's
what i found or you go to jaipur or
kerala they have a sense of uh
style which and neatness and i'm not
saying i'm i've not been to many states
but i feel like uh that's very important
to inject that in the minds of younger
people who will change the look of a
country
>> western cities are very homogeneous like
every building will have the same color
>> that is us [laughter]
>> but if you go to places like uh
even italy uh greece is different,
>> spain is different,
>> morocco is different. they all have a
character.
>> don't you feel like indian cities have
every building which is so different and
the color is so different that it
doesn't look cohesive?
>> cohesive. no, it doesn't. anyway, let's
not talk about that.
but important thing is to uh nurture
children from kindergarten. so they look
at a country in a way where they will be
the future people who will change the
way it looks
better like ai.
>> i think creativity will become more
relevant in the world of ai.
>> absolutely. because i think you're
empowering people with with a vision
>> who don't know the chops.
>> mhm.
>> and the chops are actually ai. so
>> the vision and the prompts actually
gives you options which you see oh i
love this
>> and it's a very empowering tool for
for younger people who don't have the
access to
make a movie or
>> make art or they know how to paint but
they have a vision at least it'll force
them to
have an example to in power of what it's
creating to beat that
>> right
>> which is a interesting thing now i think
when you do music also
>> you're constantly thinking now the songs
which are coming out are very
experimental like
>> the recently there's a song by ry
>> and it clearly shows that she's trying
to beat ai
>> how is that
>> uh the way the construction of the song
>> uh is different from what people would
do
>> which what ai copies right it's learned
from the past so
>> so you have to be contrarian to whatever
the predictive model is
>> absolutely yeah it forces us to think
differently okay now we got that okay
how about this
>> but can't tomorrow another ai just play
the role of
>> humans have this evolutionary
spirit and we will do something else
[laughter]
we'll go back and do something which is
completely wrong which will be very cool
>> does music have rules
>> music i feel
uh i go by nostalgia i go by
uh the good things of tradition and
sometimes i got bored with that and i
break the tradition.
so it's not one formula. it's like how
how a narrator. so like when when i'm
talking to you, if i talk anything
boring, you won't look at me. i was
like, "oh, he's already told this. i'm
going look away."
>> but i'm looking at you. i'm constantly
evolving. i'm saying like, "okay, let
let me tell
>> tell you the stuff or let me tell you a
new information which you're not." no,
then you are curious about it.
>> right?
>> music is like that. m
>> it's like a conversation where
um one is like this tune is going like
this and i need to surprise them with
this one. pull out the rhythm or chain
the key or change the rhythm
>> right chain the raa
>> or come with the same lyric in a
different way. so it is an experience
right
>> that's how i used to think i'm still
thinking the same way. do you think to
be as successful as you have been you
need to catch a counter trend?
>> what is a counter trend?
>> whenever the incumbent trend like you
said about old school music with dolak
and mandolin and all of that. no, i love
dolux but not all things [laughter] but
that should not be the only thing
>> right
>> you know even now when i do a kavali
track i use dolk and tabla
>> i [clears throat] do i use strings but
in my
>> but to be able to recognize that people
are tired of that and
>> i am the people [laughter]
>> i need to see whether i like the song
>> and if i feel good ah this is this feels
really good and they will love it
sometimes it takes time for them to get
it and they get it and then it stays
there forever
>> and for all the aspiring musicians and
songwriters and composers watching this.
what do you think the next change in
trend will be that they can get on
early?
i think all of them are so smart now
>> and because the exposure
>> they get to see everything on reals and
and social media
>> every person is a makeup person an actor
a cinematographer a director and it's
fascinating to see how the younger
people are evolving like i discover so
many people who are extraordinary in
comedy
>> in direction
>> in effective you know reels like it's
just 30 seconds and
>> they have to come up with stuff,
>> right?
>> and it forces them to become great
directors, storytellers
>> and so i get inspired by them.
>> yeah.
>> but any any suggestions young
>> lean into it,
>> leaning into something, not giving up
like you shouldn't give up. you should
go back to music and lean into it.
>> i'll show you how bad i am at some point
in
>> no, bad and good is subjective. it's
subjective,
>> right?
>> one person's bad, the other person is
good. m
>> like you know good music when you listen
to it. so
>> i'm good at listening to music.
>> that's a great start. that's a great
start.
>> that's how it is.
>> right.
>> the lean would just don't give up and
because you know you dig like then the
cliche is like first you get mud and
then you get water then you get petrol
and then you get gold.
>> so but you have to keep digging
>> right?
>> and the more you dig you will you will
forget yourself that you'll become that
>> right? how do i okay, this is very
personal. i don't know who this will
help but i can play a few chords i don't
sing well now i want to suddenly get
better not suddenly in a year get better
how do i do it
>> practice practice practice practice yeah
>> don't wait for tomorrow to practice
practice now once you go after you eat
>> sit for 5 minutes take your tambra
[clears throat]
>> singapadana
>> slowly
>> i've heard it all my life i don't know
why it flew
>> i have to tell you a secret
>> um i'm singing m
>> from 92.
>> uhhuh.
>> but then my singing was always to
compose.
>> right.
>> right. i was i'll play a chord, compose.
>> then i realized that when i'm composing,
i don't have to be in tune. i just need
to understand what tune.
>> when that becomes a habit,
>> your singing becomes more
uh not that perfect because you're
trying to reach notes and you're trying
to like scribbling something painting,
sketching something. then when i'm on
the stage is when i realized like i have
to be in tune because people are
recording, people are putting it on
youtube.
>> then i started uh my teacher said um
who passed away. so he said practice
your lower notes
>> like go
make it stronger and your higher notes
will be as strong as that. so and now
i'm learning a little bit from aja
shakaroti and his thing is like go and
go louder when you go down and that made
a lot of difference in my pitch when i'm
singing a note longer. i could feel that
i'm in pitch and when i look at some of
the reasons i like yeah okay that's good
that's good 20% improvement from what i
was doing before
>> right
>> so there's no time no age
>> right
>> we are constantly evolving in every
aspect of
>> yeah maybe i'll try and get a teacher
>> that's a great idea
>> right
>> and bombay is filled with teachers now
>> do you think there's such a thing as
talent in music
>> there is some people understand
something better than other people mhm.
>> because it comes the way the mind works.
>> it doesn't mean that other people can't
reach there.
>> right.
>> i have this theory about passion.
>> okay.
>> i feel like all people are born the same
and we all attempt different things.
if i was 5 years old and i played
cricket and i played cricket better than
the 20 classmates of mine, i would
organically become passionate at
cricket.
>> mhm. cuz i'm doing it better than the 20
kids around me.
>> do you think the same is true for music?
>> no. in when i was young, i felt i was
very bad at music.
>> yeah.
>> i had stalwarts like marilyn swinwas who
was a genius. you could play he was
younger than me. he was playing kana. i
said i'm not as good as that. and i was
seeing my teacher's son playing piano
was younger than me.
but i was forced to work anyway. so my
needed talent was less because i play
some sound effect or some simple
melodies.
>> and i met a teacher called uh jacob john
who's my father's friend.
>> he called me and said you you play very
well. i said no i don't play very well.
>> and he had this amazing technique. he
would wantedly play with mistakes
>> and we let you play. see you're playing
better than me.
so he had this incredible technique of
trick to make you feel
>> better and i hung out with him like 3
four years. it was one of some of the
best times i had with him.
>> i must also say you look incredibly
young for your age like skin is glowing
and all that.
>> that's my software is very very latest
but hardware is becoming old. [laughter]
>> any secrets?
>> secrets?
>> just don't think negative stuff. don't
worry about anything. nobody cares. we
all going to die one day.
>> so all this happened. okay.
>> yeah.
>> and then i have i have like notes about
different years of your life and what
happened and i'm trying to like go into
today.
you did andrew lloyd weber
dil happened wand mataram india at 50
muj salam all of that happened.
we come to 2006. mhm. what's happening
around this era? you started in '90s
because of the studio.
>> when you started a studio, you got this
big break in roa. your life changed
overnight. people around you started
treating you like something else. you
got a little impostor complex and
insecure about putting all your eggs in
one basket because you had seen it
happen at home at an early age. you
diversified. you continued to do many
things. you went to andrew lloyd weber's
thing. you did things outside of india
in india.
tell us where your mind is at 2006 7 8
around this era global slowdown era.
>> so 2006 i was uh appointed as the stop
tb ambassador by un.
>> mhm.
>> uh so i had went traveled to singapore
met aids tb patients and a very
completely different role. i met kofan
in the un all that stuff. and then
that's when my foundation idea of
foundation came by. and by this time you
were a big deal because you're meeting
them.
>> i don't know
>> 100%.
>> yeah. i don't yeah. so i meet them.
>> uh i come back with a vision of like why
don't we have a school like you know
>> all these musicians of my father's age
now and what if they pass and we don't
have string players or trumpet players.
>> so the idea of uh starting the school
came at 2008 where
>> uh i called one of my associates and
said hey we have to start a school. m
>> it's a free school i'm going to he said
no no no no free school nobody's going
to respect you have to get money and
i'll be the and i'll take care of it so
i didn't know anything so i took i
called him and he took care of it and
then there's so many conflicts so many
conflicts happening
>> it evolved and then finally we bought a
bigger place um mr. rambani came and
kindly inaugurated the place in 2013. my
mother was there
>> and we started the cm conservatory where
it is now in chennai.
>> by then we had some of the young best
piano players in the world young young
ones.
>> um and then it started evolving and then
oscars happened all the stuff in 2008
2009
>> i was in a band with mc jagger and
>> how big is that? like i've always heard
of oscars as being like this crazy ass
thing that
>> what is it actually like?
>> i think when you see from outside it's
much more fascinating
>> than being inside.
>> yeah.
>> inside it's just
>> it's like a
>> it's happening. yeah. it's it's like you
know once you get once you pass one then
everything's the same same photographs
are coming. hey ar look here. so that's
interesting. first when i got the
critics award nobody called me. then
then there was a golden globe. hey,
that's you. come let's take a
photograph. three people call. then the
next one is oscar.
>> you have 100 people calling your name.
>> so that i could see the whole evolution
of how famous that movie and about the
music and you're all becoming. and how
does it make you feel personally like
now i'm guessing wherever you are
>> like people are probably like
surrounding you and asking you for this
and that and pictures and
>> no actually i have lot of private
moments in the studio.
>> no when you're at home yes but if you
step out
>> i step out very rarely
>> but whenever you do
>> i'm prepared for it. [laughter] uh when
i'm very uncomfortable is when you take
a long 16our flight and you're doing a
transit when people come in
>> and i said i'm tired. no, no, but we
have to go.
>> can you take a photograph?
>> anyway, it's part of the game.
>> is there an onoff button?
>> for what?
>> for when some fan walks up to you and
he's and you're tired, you're in
transit.
>> yeah, it is. but rarely. it's not every
day. so now i have a mask because
>> they recognize you with the mask.
>> no,
>> no,
>> not everyone because i don't go with
security. i just go walk alone.
>> uh no security anywhere in
>> only only when i'm doing shows,
>> right?
>> cuz when you don't go with security,
people don't take you seriously. only
when like group of six people come over,
somebody's important. oh, that should be
him.
>> so
>> when you go to dinner in chennai, for
example,
[snorts] you have to
>> that is the irony of my life.
>> you can't. that's actually took a toll
on my family life. when nobody allows
you to eat any even in a marriage when
you go there when you're eating people
say can i take a photograph i said i'm
eating no but we are going to go we have
to go so they don't understand that
person is eating he's a human being
>> he's not being bought by you but then
you understand that how important you
are in their life and they don't want to
miss the chance to take their
perspective so i'd never eat in
marriages i just go wish them i said
they won't allow
whenever i've worked with like rock
stars abroad,
>> they're just straight on the face and i
don't do that. sorry. whether it's
hollywood actor or i've been with couple
of them and this they're straight on the
face.
>> that's why people don't come because
most of them are like that. they just
snap and say no, i don't do that
>> straight away. indian actors are more
kind. [laughter]
>> why is that?
>> i think because we you are a different
race.
>> we did a call with your sister.
>> mhm. and uh she gave us some points.
>> which one? [laughter]
>> ra.
>> yeah, i think so.
>> okay.
>> you didn't have many friends growing up,
she said.
>> yes. i had two friends actually.
>> yeah. one was a electronic greek geek
>> who used to love making amplifiers. i
still met him. the other one was also
electronic geek.
>> i was fascinated with electronics when i
was young.
is it the same even now? is it tough to
be friends for somebody in your
position?
>> there's no time
>> outside of time.
>> just even to spend time with family. i
have to make sure that i now pull them
on to a dinner or something where not
everybody's free. they all have their
own lives now, right?
>> do you have friends?
>> uh, all the directors are my friends.
>> work people don't count.
>> i don't treat like work. i treat like
when i work with anandra or mia or
>> uh
>> people ask me this question and i say
who are your friends? i'll say lawyer,
ca, all of that. it doesn't add up. it
doesn't come.
>> then then i should have a life where i
go to a club or
>> no i go to a gym or something.
>> nothing. no hobbies, sport, gym.
>> no,
>> nothing.
>> no.
>> i love what i'm doing. i love because
it's not just music now. now it's
metahumans and this ai
>> and this virtual reality and you know i
have younger people who are joining and
doing amazing work.
>> so they are my friends. i just eat with
them, hang out with them.
>> each team is different
and yeah and i sometimes dm people.
>> if there's a good uh person with a farm
uh interesting plantation thing, i dm
them. say, "hey, i would like to meet
you
>> then." no, it's like random people. it's
not just music. it is illustrators and
cosplay artists sometimes.
>> anyone incredible you've run across like
this by dming them. by dm, i'm assuming
social media.
>> the the most biggest surprise i got was
spikeley dming me. hey sir, how are you?
>> really?
>> yeah, i was doing co
>> dm on what platform?
>> on instagram.
>> you're active like that? you use it
yourself?
>> yeah.
>> yeah.
>> yeah.
>> can i message you?
>> of course. yeah,
>> but i i don't pick everything. i see
sometimes you feel
>> i see some oh, blue teleski. who's
>> what would be interesting for me to send
you on instagram? that will make you be
like, "thanks, nikl for sending me."
>> i have this investor who's got $1
billion to invest in your [laughter]
company. i'll be
>> immediately answer.
>> yeah.
>> and then
>> you went you went to the us and met a
bunch of ai people, right?
>> yeah, i do.
>> some of them are my friends. okay.
>> and they mentioned it. you went to
perplexity, you went to
>> who was the most interesting of them
all?
>> no, actually it's very very brief.
uh sri ram and arti came to my house and
we hung out there and
i met savas in
>> public.
>> what did you make of him?
>> met uh
>> he's also from chennai. what did you
make of him?
>> yeah. yeah, he's very good. but he's my
son's friend more than me.
>> yeah.
>> yeah. they hang out.
>> and sam alman.
>> what do you make of sam?
sam strangely i was the only person i
followed on twitter for a while
>> when chajidi came in
>> and he was like he was looking at the
secret mountain. he was fascinated i
think.
>> mhm. than whatever help you guys need
>> uh in technology right but i think this
is not just secret bound is about
fashion
>> merchandise music wisdom entertainment
>> quite a lot big package and pretty
exhausting if we don't have a big team
so that's that's what one of the reasons
why we are like
>> waiting to for the big leap to
>> we're just preparing all the ground work
on that one
>> when you hang out with those ai guys. i
i've ended up spending a reasonable
amount of time with all of them. in
fact, i have to go.
>> my first my first
uh comment with any ai person is
>> don't make people lose jobs.
uh empower
people
to remove the curses of generational
curses which comes to like poverty uh
misinformation
>> and lack of tools to create stuff to
telling stories right
>> i think this is the from the beginning i
was like a broken record just saying
this because you don't
>> how is that possible [snorts]
>> that's if you buy a gun you set rules
right
>> you don't give it to everyone
>> cuz they're going to shoot everybody
sorry, we're going to kill people. it's
not free to use. it has restrictions.
>> no, you're not shooting people, but you
can pull the carpet off, make them
jobless. it's like making families going
into poverty.
>> so, it is the rules. humans have to set
the rules. you have traffic rules,
>> you have immigration rules,
>> your customer. while it might kill jobs
in the short term, one can argue that
productivity in a society will go up in
the long.
>> you have to shape it up and saying
>> you can't give a tool which is very very
destructive in
making a family go into debt.
>> if somebody just learned something and
now it everything can be done with ai.
>> he's going to be helpless because he's
learned that in college for 4 years. he
spent all his life learning something
and ai can do it in 2 seconds. m
>> so we need to find an alternate way
before you jump and give those tools to
people.
>> tough though.
>> no because australia never said like no
no person can learn
>> uh use their data to learn stuff so that
to create their identity
>> but the new ais are learning of
>> learn do stuff which humans cannot
rather than
>> doing things which humans can do better.
that's what i'm saying.
>> yeah. so that's why i think art plays a
very big tool like you need to make
musical theater symphonies and all the
stuff which can entertain people
>> and they can be a part of that larger
system
>> economic system.
>> the problem with regulation around ai in
my opinion
is the incumbents will use it to not
allow new people to come into ai.
if there is a young kid in bangalore
trying to build a ai rapper albeit
>> by virtue of regulation he will be
regulated out of
>> no not that kind of regulation not in
entertainment i'm saying in in finding a
way all the [clears throat] people
running things the entrepreneurs or the
chief
>> they should be careful in finding
because this is history is going to talk
about them in future
>> like how they made something which is a
monster as a blessing, right? it could
become a monster. it's a blessing and a
curse.
>> i'm actually going back to the us. i've
been there a lot this year. i've been
like working, interning with these ai
companies trying to learn what what is
coming up next, what can be done. i'm
going back. the reason shaker mountain
is also set a pattern
>> where we use the best of ai
>> and we use the best of humans
>> and there'll be so many jobs there's so
much of uh human contribution to
something like big as this so that
>> it becomes an industry by itself
>> right
ai in music will
hurt musicians right
>> it'll hurt but then can ai go and sing
with the guitar in a house or in a
concert
>> or can it teach in the human way which a
teacher has been teaching with the
spirit passing on the spirit of music to
a
>> student there are so many things which
comes human experience is the the best
word i would say which it can't do
anything on tv could be generated now
>> right so i i think that that's why live
concerts live dance live musical theater
symphonies will be respected even more,
right? the value of that is going to go.
>> so, in a way, you're saying build more
live experiences, businesses for young
people who want to start a business
>> because we're all now locked in
something called the flats, imprisoned
in those little boxes. we can't even get
out. so live actually gives goes back to
that community feeling where you enjoy
something which the other person share
the experience the joy and
>> that like that is also being reinvented
now live experiences now the way visuals
and everything is time code singing with
with um augmented um musical gadgets
>> visual gadgets
>> so the experience is not as like how we
watched 10 years back it's much more
better. now,
>> when you work with people and you try
and figure out what music should be put
out, i'm guessing very often you know so
much more about music than these people.
>> i don't know anything. [laughter]
i go like a blank slate because
>> like if a movie producer tells you for
example say in hollywood that this is
not working, can we change it? what do
you do?
>> always change it. i uh i don't go with
one idea,
>> right? i go with sometimes four ideas,
five ideas.
>> then i throw out two of them. so i keep
sometimes three. i play them and
sometimes you have an instinct to say
this is going to work right.
>> i put that in somewhere i think they
will connect to something but this is
nice but can you do this? yeah, i'll add
that. it's not a readymade product which
is given. it's
>> that is why that will never work.
somebody calls up i do a song inside of
me there specifics about story
characterization vibe which they like.
so
>> i was reading this book about
michelangelo like
>> artist extraordinaire
all time whatever and he was like once
while he was sculpting david
>> a politician came to him and said the
nose is too big. so
what he did next is he just he was on a
scaffolding. he threw some dust down and
he said he changed the nose but actually
he didn't do anything.
>> okay. exactly.
>> it's just
>> a lot of that.
>> yeah. yeah. it happens. see now it's
correct and you don't know anything.
[laughter]
it's just their ego.
>> yeah.
>> see i made it better sometimes.
[music]
i was in delhi couple of days ago and i
was at a friend's house and i tried the
new meta glasses.
>> okay. it's coming.
>> it's coming. yeah. which have a
so on the right side they have a display
and you have to wear a band.
>> yeah.
>> and then you click like this and you
scroll like this. for the first time
it's starting to feel like it could be
the form factor.
>> yeah. do you have a bet on what could be
the form factor of tomorrow? how you
interact with ai?
>> uh, so i started researching on virtual
reality around from 2015.
>> so i directed my first vr movie in 2016
and i was fascinated because it it's so
real. it's so immersive and it helps you
to go to places which you never been
like the spaces you can you can see
spaces which antarctica you know
>> the vatican
>> right
>> and the cabba
>> the temple
>> where people
it's so real right and i could probably
look at one image for more than 5
minutes it's there's so many details so
much details in it
>> so it fascinated and then i i said why
don't we do i had a story and i said why
can't we do a movie in this this is the
path nobody's taking it very difficult
path
>> lone ranger
>> taking it and working so i did le mask
now it's been almost 9 years since i
directed that one
>> wow
>> it's playing in singapore and it's
playing in vancouver dome now
>> and you have to wear the vr glasses
>> in vancouver no it's projected in the
dome
>> right
>> it been translated to dome thing
>> so my primary job is of a stock investor
yeah.
>> so i used to follow
meta now facebook then stock for the
duration that they attempted to put a
lot of money behind the metaw
>> they would spend something like 89
billion a year if i'm not wrong about
the number
and eventually they ditched it. so does
that they didn't ditch it or they
stopped the amount of money that was
being spent on
>> i think what happened was for for making
vr movies you need to unlearn many
things
>> for content so film people come and use
their techniques to do virtual reality
it makes people throw up
>> so because i didn't have any experience
in film i could take the path of what i
felt will be right for for me so like
moving the camera would be called nausea
then the frame rate
>> global shutter
>> and what kind of experience it would be
great for a person who's a
>> it shouldn't be a replacement for cinema
but but an alternate
coexisting right so what you don't get
in cinema you'll get on this one
>> in cinema you get the kind of community
feel like you all whistled on the same
thing you all
and look at the other person oh that's a
great scene you know that you can't do
in vr it's very personal you can't look
at your facebook, twitter and
>> but you can have other people who are
also on vr watching something with you.
>> no, but this the like when you come to
chennai play you my experience it's
installed there.
>> you will understand what i'm talking
about.
>> yeah.
>> mhm.
>> so i have no agenda today. i don't want
to speak about anything. i want to speak
about what you want to speak about. so
>> let me speak about the meta band.
>> yeah.
>> again,
>> uh this idea came from when i was
hanging out in la.
>> mhm. after the oscars, grammys and all
this stuff. i said like why are indians
not creating something for the west or
not the west for the whole world right
because we've seen great bands coming
from
um sweden, america, england, africa but
the only indian was famous like ravish
shankar zakar rosin alshanka subramanyam
>> but then uh why can't young india create
something like that?
because we need to be ahead. we can't go
back to what they did but we need to
find the space which india what india
wants to say to the world.
>> so that's where secret mountain was
created
>> and not just to sing hindi songs.
>> mhm.
>> but being a voice for from india to the
world not like indian voice but an
international voice. right. so we've
been working on it for 3 years.
>> can you simplify it for me? like i
watched a bunch of videos of you talking
about it.
>> yeah.
>> i saw the characters who are the band
members, the blonde guy, the the punjabi
guy, all of them.
>> and they all said that my proficiency is
in a and b.
>> yeah. yeah.
>> and we are a band.
>> yeah.
>> but what does that mean really?
uh it talks about [sighs]
each community each where they're coming
from like africa,
>> north india, south india, ireland.
>> she was the prettiest the african.
>> yes.
>> we made sure that we gave her the full
respect.
>> uh especially africa, ireland, india,
>> china, they have millions of stories to
tell.
>> but there's no conduit for that. but now
if they're virtual,
>> they're now mentors for each character.
so we we go like this is what we want to
say. is it okay politically? this is the
kind of lyrics which are going to come
and their lyricists there are i'm
composing all the stuff but then we have
partners like people like edin they
promised to write songs for this he was
hearing a couple of songs i love this i
want to do something so
>> so these are virtual characters
>> virtual characters
>> you are the mentor for say one virtual
character amongst all
>> i'm mentor for the whole band
>> for the whole band
>> all of my digital children
>> right and they will create songs
>> they won't create songs so they are
human people like like in a movie, a
james bond movie comes in. james one is
a character.
>> people keep changing, but james bond is
constant. [snorts] superman is constant.
spider-man is constant.
>> so these people will be constant.
>> exactly. they'll be constant. the voices
might change
>> because they're all live voices, right?
live musicians. live musicians going to
play with it.
>> so it's not ai created content,
composition or anything. it's all live.
>> the only the face of that,
>> right?
they won't have flash and blood, but
what what going what's going to appear
on tv or or in a in a show will be real
because because of the technology
hologram and
>> and why would this be better than say
red shiran is writing a song for one of
those characters,
>> him singing it himself and having his
face on it?
>> because this is a multicultural band.
they stand for the whole world.
>> yeah. there is no band like this. m
>> either you see a k-pop band who are all
koreans, an english band, they're all
english and very rarely you see this
kind of eclectic diverse band coming
together.
>> right. and me being not in just one
genre of stuff and film music has taught
me to be expansive.
>> right.
>> right. so i felt like
>> taking the burden on myself to see how
much i can go dwell in it making it pop.
i'm not able to picture it. do you think
an audience will i mean the same premise
i guess in a way applies to movies where
>> you look at uh did you see the aba
voyager?
>> yeah.
>> you saw that
>> the hologram right?
>> yeah. so this is this is probably a
diverse version and maybe seventh
generation of that
>> right
>> that was like created 7 years back right
>> this is today's technology.
>> was that kind of playing on memory
because everybody kind of
>> yeah. but then being a songwriter and i
just tested all the songs
>> and i was testing all the songs. i was
trying to see whether they like the
music or not.
>> so all kinds of nationalities like
people from america, england, ukraine
and it tested very well. at least four,
three to four songs tested like i like
this. not they didn't mention the same
song,
>> right?
>> they mentioned four different songs. so
i felt like okay, we're on a good track.
an end case. what will be happening with
this?
>> uh they will be performing. they could
also perform in three different places
too
>> at the same time. omni potent
>> because they're virtual, right? they
could be performing in england, in
india, in dubai all the same time,
>> right?
>> different different teams can come in,
>> right?
>> and they could become a series, they
could become a movie.
>> have you seen nfts?
>> yes.
>> this kind of like
it started like that. it started like in
a way when hara came to
>> it started like can we do a you know
crypto nft kind of thing. i said like we
need a bigger idea
>> right
>> the bigger idea is this and let it let
other stuff source come from here
>> because even if that goes off like a fad
this will stay the music will stay
>> uh the vision of this band stays and
what they going to say
>> so it's a solid idea so that's one of
the reasons why even after 3 years we
all excited about it
>> and every inch we move towards getting
it out we feel like
because it's evolving. when we started
it was a a game engine, unreal engine
and metahumans.
>> now we have ai technology which enhances
the face
>> enhances not generative but face
swapping and all that stuff which might
used to take a long time
>> and then even the capture is much faster
cleanse the capture which sometimes you
have some stutters with this costumes.
>> i can send you all the footage. yeah.
no, i'd love to see it
>> tomorrow. if there was a movie with say
uh shah ruk khan in a particular
actress,
not really them but artificially
generated movie would you watch it?
>> there are so many movies like that you
don't even know
half the movie is
>> 100% of the movie
>> 100% of movie. it depends on the story.
you don't do what what a shah rukhan
will do
>> well. you don't try to imitate that.
that's that'll be mediocre of this band.
they have to do things which only they
can do. they are they have the
superpower to do the stuff right. so
that is important because i've seen a
lot of people use ai
>> uh generate a tv serial which is you
know tv serial actors can do better than
what this generates but you do stuff
which will be impossible for
>> uh production or to finance or to act
and do and give that experience which is
transformative
>> once you've been able to art articulate
an expression and voice and program it
in
>> long term these ai characters will
inevitably they're not air characters.
they are real characters. it took 9
months to illustrate to get the nose,
the eyes, the smile and everything.
>> no, but these characters will always do
better than real world humans.
>> no, that's we i'm the founder of that.
so i determine and i've set the rules,
the parameters for what how much it can
talk, how much money you can send to
each fan.
>> all this stuff will be set by our team,
the found.
>> why would it send money to a fan? that's
the secret.
so just to be like i think if they make
money, the band makes money,
>> what can they share the money to with
people with who deserve
>> and so that is the whole ultimate plan
that
>> they benefit not just by watching it but
you know that is the whole
by going to things which
humans might be corrupted but with with
the kind of transparency which
systems can run and do all the checks
and balances
it is possible.
>> i know people have attempted this with
social media where super users
>> yeah.
>> got a percentage of the traction or the
revenue that the social media platform
earned overall.
>> so here you're saying because the
success of the character is dependent on
the amount of traction which in turn is
dependent on the fan you would share a
part of the revenue with the fan.
>> that is the plan
>> right? and in future
>> so you become the platform which
collects a rake in a way
>> even in the in the future even the
website will have all six of them
>> right
>> you can talk to each of them they'll
answer back
>> this is not a real human answering back
though at the back
>> no the parameters are said by
>> all the data all the all the all the
information or all the wisdom which each
character wants to which comes from
mentors which comes from the research of
what does an africa
>> an african person
>> want the world to hear what is the
unsaid narrative about that or what does
a north indian wants to what a south
indian i just put that because it's
>> we are different like a punjabi is
different from a tamil guy right
>> and extremes north and south and a
chinese person an irish person you have
great history the great history in every
character
>> and you would scrape news to figure out
bias and narrative
>> no it is just yeah.
>> from a common perspective and in a
middle ground i think when you look at
things there are a lot of unfair things
which has happened to many
>> many races.
>> mhm.
>> undeniable.
>> mhm.
>> and even if you look at uh the genocide
in africa which has happened which is
more than any other genocide in the
world.
>> mhm.
>> it's unfortunate but
>> the world it is not a political band.
they're not going to do political stuff
but i feel the gravitas of that is very
important for
uh a band coming from india which is
just which is pure in thinking and which
is entertaining first of all not boring
telling advice
>> would it speak about society
>> of course
>> but when you speak about society you
become political
>> i think you'll find the balance right
>> ai will help [laughter]
>> there's this interesting debate
happening in the us now where
if
i'm the new york times
i'm the editor of the new york times. if
a journalist writing an article under
the new york times says something which
is defamatory,
>> yeah,
>> i'm liable.
>> yeah.
>> the same question then starts to apply
for a large language model.
>> absolutely.
>> if the output they are throwing out, are
they liable?
>> so much of responsibility. yes.
>> they claim not.
>> no. but then that's why we have to set
the parameters.
>> set the par. very important. sometimes
you can't say the truth. just keep
quiet,
>> right? [snorts]
>> i think because it's music
>> and because it's about entertainment, we
don't have to go into that stuff and
>> um conflicts. it's very important to
entertain in a way where
>> people get hope and faith.
>> mhm.
>> and yeah,
>> someone said
a passion ceases to be a passion when
you truly understand it.
the good thing about music is you never
understand it.
>> it's constant evolution.
>> that's why they say no like if you paint
with the right hand constantly and you
get comfortable with it
>> you know tie your right hand and paint
with the left hand.
>> mhm.
>> but then you will find a different way
because your mind wants to express
>> and the limitation of what
>> uh your left hand is
>> will make its own art and it won't be
like
>> the comfort zone. oh, i can't do that.
so, i'll do this. and that'll be
different.
>> so, music is also like that. sometimes
you just have to throw all the formulas.
>> i have to rethink. i have to see. i have
to get there, but i don't want to go in
this route.
>> i'll go on this route. cuz you're the
first listener. the maker is the first
listener. like the cook is the first
taster, right?
>> whenever i cook food,
>> you don't taste it.
>> no, because i i don't know what it is.
like whenever i spend half an hour, 45
minutes making something,
i'm inherently biased into liking what
i've made because of the opportunity
cost of time that has been invested.
you're less
judgmental or critical of you.
>> no, i'm very critical,
>> right?
>> when i um listen to it a couple of days
back later or a week later, you you know
what's working, what's not working. m
>> what makes you oh, i love that. oh, this
is boring. i've heard this before.
[snorts]
>> i do a curation and then whichever thing
i like. sometimes i don't like anything.
>> i go back to the drawing board.
>> but how do you prioritize something like
that where it's not it's not what is
earning you your wage, but to focus on
it enough to not give up. i think what
happens when you do something
constantly
>> you get fatigued
>> your mind becomes tired
>> and in in this case where um photography
or anything else poetry or it's all part
of the creative industry it's not like
gambling or going away from something
losing money it is enhancing your
widening your imagination widening
your confidence in you that you can do
much oh,
>> are you still able to do that? pick up
new hobbies.
>> yeah.
>> yeah.
>> yeah. something which doesn't involve a
display because all my life i've been
sitting in front of a display.
>> so that's one of the reasons i don't
play video games any playstation or
>> xbox and all that stuff because i i
don't want to sit in front of a and i
wanted to try something organic. so i'm
going might go into farming a little bit
more.
>> are you farming now? yeah, we have a
mom's plot the trust plot. so
>> near the house
>> there's one from chennai. mhm.
>> that's where house samadi is also there.
[music]
>> okay. this is on the work side. tell us
what's going on in the personal side.
>> by personal i don't mean like some
controversial thing or anything like
that. where is your head space at? how
are you looking at society, at music, at
what is occupying?
>> what's beautiful about the past uh i
would say 18 years is starting the
foundation, starting the music school
and uh watching miracles happen there,
you know, kids
um and demolishing the whole stigma
saying that this cast is intelligent,
this cast is not. demolishing all the
stuff. if any kid who's created by god,
this the light of god is in every kid
and the knowledge comes from god. it's
not that they are worthy or not. if they
taught properly and we find those kids,
they shine, they become an orchestra and
they all play together as one voice, as
one emotion. so that's what we
discovered and it's a phenomenal
breakthrough which we are proud as a
family. my sister runs a school, i go
there, i'm the mentor, i'm the
principal. mhm.
>> and then recently we went to canada for
the glen gold foundation. they invited
us and they all played. it's such a
great moment to see kids from
corporation schools taking your flight
going to canada
>> and playing for you know billionaires
sitting there
>> and that itself is a great statement and
that keeps me going. if i'm the
principal of that kind of kids i need to
be shining more. i need to be working
more
>> and that keeps me going. like people ask
me what keeps you going
>> is that i need to inspire my my school
children there my students where we
teaching incredible
artistry right to sing or to play the
piano to compose
>> um to inspire.
yeah.
>> do you think humans can innately be
altruistic selfless?
it is how we brought up. i've seen many
people many families uh any religion if
they are coming from a great family if
they the fathers and mothers are
selfless and they act upon it
>> and they create a kind of a system where
the kids automatically get inspired they
look up to their father and mother. if
you go one level deeper,
>> yeah,
>> why is being selfless appealing?
>> i think it is hardwired. like if you
look at
>> every spiritual uh teaching in the world
>> is to serve.
>> mhm.
>> only when you serve. somebody served and
built you this house.
>> somebody served and built the road.
>> mhm.
>> and they might be dead, but their soul
is there in every and somebody build a
school. did they do it with the intent
of service or did they do it with the
intent of individual gain that they were
chasing?
>> of course, everybody needs to run the
family. but when you think about uh
they're not they you you can see the
sweat, you can see the
>> and everybody wants their work to shine,
>> right?
>> when they want the work to excel, that
means it is a excel. it's not
mediocrity, right?
>> there's a sincerity is very important.
the sincerity is what makes them tick.
mhm.
>> get them another job.
>> if i'm not sincere in my music, they're
going to throw me out from a movie,
right?
>> i think you're way beyond that.
>> no, i'm just saying.
>> i mean, nobody
>> anybody can be thrown. anybody can
>> cease to exist. it is
>> because if i'm not sincere to that
thing, i'm not sincere to myself.
>> i won't be able to sleep. if if i let a
mix pass by or a song which could be
better and i didn't work enough for
that,
>> that will be the biggest punishment or
self torture for me
>> for for at least 3 to 4 months. i should
have done that better. i should have
done. so i never give that chance for my
mind to torture me
even at the cost of getting a bad name
from the producer. right.
>> mhm.
>> so i'll i'll share a secret. i was going
through some i would not say bad time
but i would say i was feeling vulnerable
because of some issue being blamed for
something that i didn't have anything to
do with and i was sitting and thinking
about all these things
when i have been altruistic
is it
because the projection of altruism has
appealed because in the society that so
if if i go back in time when i think
about right?
all men
are competing with each other at some
level. the hunter gatherer, the the
biggest hunter got more validation and
importance in the society that he was
in. so everybody wanted to be the
biggest hunter at that time. and i think
with evolution, society has kind of
progressed like that.
in the capitalistic society,
>> the projection of being selfless
>> is a value ad.
>> so i think we are spiritually oriented.
>> if you believe in god, whichever god,
there's only one creator, right? we call
them in different names. so if i take
that path, there might be atheists. i
respect everybody. i've taken that path
where i feel like every breath is a
blessing to me. every opportunity is a
blessing to me and it comes from one
source. it comes from me surrendering.
then i don't have to worry. i will be
truthful. i'll you know
>> mhm.
>> i'll remember you and he remembers me.
>> mhm.
>> and if my share which he wants to give
has to come to me, even if the whole
world is against it, it's going to come
to me.
>> right. right? and if i don't deserve
something and if i want that if it's not
my share, it will never come to me. so
it's simple to be peaceful. i take this
as a formula. if anybody there so
there's no cause of jealousy.
>> if somebody's in a better car and a
better house or
>> i said his share his share is coming.
it's great.
>> i love it. i praise god for that and may
live happy. so you don't have the the
root of jealousy is now killed. mhm.
>> and if i need to be if i need something
like that, my worthiness has to be
improved.
once i'm worthy, suppose i'm going to
get 100 kgs, i need to handle it.
>> i need to take it other it's going to
destroy me.
>> i've seen many people be given something
which is very valuable and that has
destroyed their whole lives because
they're not able to take
>> that much. so each one gets what they
share by becoming worthy of it. become
the vessel empty vessel which can and
become cleaner and then you'll get all
that gift i think this this over years
you realize that one oh i didn't get
that project i didn't i'm not famous in
this area so you become worthy you'll
get
>> so
>> do you feel like that you are probably
one of the proudest sons of our country
ever
>> no i'm just saying like we can get we
sometimes know we human right oh that
music is selling well, it it crossed
>> two billion streams. i was like, fine.
>> right. so my share is always coming to
me and i'm working for it
>> and each day
>> i'm trying to get become worthy of
something else and right
>> i know you follow islam and
>> mostly sufism because
>> sufism
>> uh my quest to religion was more
spiritual
to because i've been in
>> i'm a fan of all the religions right
>> i've studied christianity and hinduism
and islam m i think every religion has
something beautiful about it. but i also
keep trying to figure out the
intricacies of what
makes one religion different from
another and why one works
depending on the
>> other my problem is killing people in
the name of religion. i agree
>> or harming people or abusing people in
the name of religion. it's not cool for
me. like i feel like um
it is a tool to discover greater things
and we have to go which is the core of
humanity right and that's one of the
reasons why i love music
>> uh i love to entertain i think when i
perform i feel like it's a shrine we all
enjoying the fruits of you know oneness
>> in in a stadium where you don't even
know some people believe some people
don't believe and they come from
different nationalities different
languages but one sound and one
happiness and one ecstasy which is
beautiful. that's what the wonderment
tour is about which i'm doing.
>> can you tell me more about sufism? i'm
very interested.
>> sufism is
>> somebody gave me two books to read about
this.
>> okay. the simple thing is to discover
yourself.
>> how do you discover yourself? because
you have screens.
>> your true self is uh screened.
>> and to remove those screens, you have to
perish.
m
>> so [clears throat] when you perish
>> you become a part of the
the light
>> you're saying when you are alive perish
take out ego in a way
>> yeah so is like dying before dying it
says right what is death the death of
lust the death of greed death of
jealousy [clears throat]
>> the death of judgmental
>> it's like buddhism take away desire
>> no this is different this is like when
you remove everything
>> the drop mingles the ocean that's it
there's no drop there's no ocean
>> metaphorically m
>> so we are all in the process. we know
some people achieve it early and when
they achieve it early they go off they
pass off.
>> so when that happens is your voice
becomes the voice of god. your deeds
become the deeds of god.
>> your your sight becomes the sight of
god. so so your ego is gone and then you
become transparent to the divine.
>> so this is the main essence of it. so
when you say aas who the saints who are
like sab or sab or
>> um so they've achieved that status and
when you go to a place like that you
don't worship them you go in a place
where they're surrounded with spiritual
beings like angels who are praying
constantly because that place is
blessed. so when you pray there it's
effective much more to god than in a
normal place because it's like a
gathering like if you go
>> in a place where intelligent people are
it [clears throat] sticks to you you get
that knowledge right
>> like energy you believe in in a way
>> energy correct
>> like if you go to a temple which has
like tupati i go every year
>> you do feel a certain way
>> yeah there's a secret of every spiritual
place and uneniable i think
>> every spiritual place
>> yeah if if people are going there
>> there's a blessing there
>> there's there's honesty there is the
commonality of faith is what i love like
you might be in a different religion i
might be in different but the sincerity
of the faith is what is measured i feel
>> that's what makes you do good things
that's what makes me do good things
>> not that i'm woriing a god who's
different right
>> so i might build a school you might
build a school
>> and but everything's benefited humanity
is benefited by that so h
>> i heard you say in another interview
karma
>> karma
>> karma this is leading towards karma as
the answer. uh
i think in in in the belief of you know
sufism or islam
um
you're judged by your deeds right not by
how much money you have what car you
have or what how famous you are but your
deeds the deeds. so that's why we're all
spiritual we call us
>> fakis spiritual beggars. we might be
rich in money but poor in spirituality
and that's one of the reasons why um i
consider myself as a spiritual
>> beggar. so i go to that or i sit near
the beach or meditate just to get
spiritually rich.
>> then spiritual richness comes in and
material riches follows
>> right. if you need it,
>> if you don't need it, it's fine. and
then there is the aura which comes to
you and which is a blessing which comes
to you. so your work becomes successful.
you what you do with intention becomes
more um
i appreciate it i would say yeah
>> i ask everybody what is spirituality
some people tell me they ask me if i'm
spiritual i'm like i don't even know
what it means what does spirituality
mean to you
>> uh the good deeds being kind
>> to serve humanity
>> and to be respectful to your parents to
your neighbors
>> is that morality or spirituality it is
spiritual.
>> i mean these are all part of sharia. if
you look at smiling is a part of sharia.
smiling at someone is the biggest
charity. if you don't have money to give
you smile at them,
>> you know.
>> so
the beauty of uh i mean i'm just a
student. i'm not an expert in anything.
>> don't take me seriously.
>> i'm constantly trying to embibe and i
don't read stuff. i want to experience
things and then i realize okay that's
true. m
>> i don't read something and believe
something which is oh this is what it
says and i believe in it but i want to
knock at a door i should get an answer
whether it's music where spirituality
and that's how my life is i test out
everything
>> right so
even music when they say something is
good
>> everybody says oh that's a hit song
listen to it if it's not good enough for
me as i throw it out
>> i it has to do something to my heart it
has to do something to my soul and
that's why i don't care when some song
some my songs fail. i said i know it's
going to come back and 3 years later
what a song this is. i said yeah i knew
it.
>> so that self validation is very
important to find believe in your work
and find why it is not.
>> so in a way you want to give more than
you take. if all
>> musical actually right music is giving
and i'm getting so much love from people
>> i'm so i feel worthless most of the
times like do i need this? do i deserve
this?
>> makes you work harder.
>> when i think of indians,
i think of you know politics. there is
one person who comes to mind. i think of
cricket maybe sachin and virat come to
mind. i think of artists acting wise
maybe i don't know amitab bachan
somebody like that comes to mind. when i
think of music not i when the country
thinks of music you come to mind.
they say that
it's easy to be godlike
if you get the validation and devotion
that comes with
being known as god.
it's much harder for a normal person to
be godlike by virtue of that.
>> so, who's the god?
>> you're known as the god.
>> no, i'm not. i mean, god of music in
this domain for sure.
>> no, they just
>> i i am such a big fan like your song
tohi. i think i must have heard that
song through so many like heartbreaks
and falling in love and stuff like that
and maybe you wrote it for a completely
different reason. but
>> actually, you know, strangely what
happened was
>> mani wanted a he wanted a love song.
>> i was like, what love song? and i was so
famished and i was like sleeping and
then this tune was coming into my mind
say so slow.
>> so anyway it's coming it's like coming
in my dream
>> right
>> so i took my i used to have a tape
record like a mini cassette. so i just
recorded it and so next day like where
is the tune? i said i got around you and
i like it's okay let's record then we
recorded it and so for the for the
singers
>> i was i wanted spb or jsas
>> so i put also haran's name and then i
>> picked i don't do that anymore so i
prayed and picked one it had haran's
name
>> right
>> so har is a very very unusual singer for
that song right
>> why is that
>> because he's a g singer
>> right
>> and even now when he sings concert
does all this stuff. he doesn't stand on
one note because that's that's his
style, right?
>> so, we recorded it and then uh money
shot it.
>> then he called up. he said, "re this
song is doing something. i just put it
on it and it's magic."
>> um i think we need to do a bim, you
know, when she's running. then we added
all that music in it. so it had a
interesting history.
>> no, incredible song. love that song.
>> but now that you're on this in this
space, like you're essentially god to
all of us.
>> no, no, no. i'm not god. i'm a servant
only.
>> how does that make you feel?
>> it's a double-edged sword, right?
>> it's like they say there's no
fame without blame.
>> it just takes one second for people to
completely turn the coin.
>> so, i don't take it seriously. m
>> i said i'm sincere to what i believe in
and
even if i shout at people i say sorry
guys i'm human right sometimes the
pressure i shout at people
>> you don't look like somebody who can
shout at people
>> come to my studio
>> not always
>> yeah you seem like you have a very calm
>> i'm calm most of the time but
>> for me my work sincerity is it demands a
lot of if something is not happening
then i'm failing myself and failing the
client the client when was the last time
you shouted at somebody and for what?
>> yesterday. [laughter]
>> really?
>> no, just because it's a very demanding
work,
>> right?
>> suppose if you're having 77 tracks and
then you want the strings to be loud or
even, you know, eqing a strings or
>> uh i need speed like musicians are
passionate, right?
>> you don't want somebody to take like 30
minutes to get something which i think
could just take
>> 1 minute.
>> is that what irritates you? something
taking longer than it should.
>> no, no. i'm just saying like
>> is my my voice will be a little louder.
the dynamics will be forte, not cancel
[snorts] like musical language they say.
>> anyway,
>> what are you looking forward to at this
point? what what are you scared of and
what are you looking forward?
>> scared of?
>> yeah.
>> all the scary things have already
happened in my life. [laughter]
>> my father's death, my grandmother's
death, my mother's death. uh
>> and um i'm looking forward.
>> and does it affect you in that order?
>> it did. right. it made me like complete
numb.
>> it made me zen mode. it made me believe
that everybody's going to die. so it
kind of
catching on to something and loving
something deeply is a is a
unfortunately
>> anti-spirituality. it's not
anti-spiritual as a loving the true love
is the love for god.
>> i feel like every other love is tested.
>> and when you say god, you in a way are
saying universe
>> the the creator
>> the creator. so and i think we can learn
from everything from that plant, from
the sea, from the mountain, from the
sky,
>> from a bird, from a microorganism.
>> is that where your music is most
inspired by nature?
>> absolutely. mhm.
>> also mathematical
>> of uh and the complexity of every
creature, every creation
>> and in the galaxy we're just not even a
dot, right? and the multiple galaxies
and
>> makes you humble
>> how small you are, how
the micro and macro they say, right?
do you also look at that technically
like in my world of trading we have
fibonacci sequences the golden ratio of
>> what and try to find that in music or
create
>> you know i just go by instinct i go by
>> what will be interesting and what will
be a good combination of things and
>> what are you most looking forward
>> i'm looking forward to the success of
secret mountain
>> if it deserves and because we are
putting all our hard work and
>> we want to create something
extraordinary from india to the world
and
because we we put 3 years of a life in
it.
>> mhm.
>> you want to make this
the most significant
um entity from india to the world.
>> mhm.
>> are you bored of movies now? no, i'm
never because you know
>> if a western artist has to do an album,
they have to think about it. i'm getting
help from the script, from the director,
from the screenwriter, from the
lyricist.
>> my part is just music, right?
>> so each album is different because
>> the different combination of different
consciousness comes together
>> and we create with the intention of
creating something great. we push
ourselves into and when we have live
feedback
>> each song is you know how it's received
and how people
>> so that magic is not changed at all like
what you get from people that instant
feedback and the adulation in the
concert is a great thing
>> i never want to lose that and if i want
to do anything like i want to do a
private album
>> instrumental album or a collaborative
album i'm free to do it
>> nobody's stopping okay.
>> m
>> the big project right now is ramayan.
>> there's ramayan. there is uh so many
sacred mountain
>> and um
couple of english ones going on and and
an arabic movie. i composed
>> horror movie.
>> wow.
>> called bob. then
>> namit showed me parts of ramay.
>> it it looks incredible.
>> yeah.
>> looks sounds incredible.
>> thank you. do you think there's a future
to the movie business? the movie theater
business.
>> so theater business is not going
anywhere. it's going to stay but it
should be reinvented.
>> can you tell me how?
>> because over 100 years now we are still
seeing a rectangle screen.
>> and of course some 3d and all the stuff
comes in. i think immersive thing is the
future like the spear what what's doing
vegas. everything looks so unbelievably
spiritual and
it's something very human about watching
with that quality.
>> i've never been there but i've seen the
videos.
>> it's incredible.
>> yeah.
>> yeah. i think that's the future because
you can never get that in home
entertainment or or a phone or anything.
it's experience that kind of it's
incredible.
>> so you're saying everybody can afford a
big screen. not everybody but a lot of
people can afford a big screen at home.
so the difference between a rectangle in
your house and the rectangle in a movie
theater can't just be 10x the size. it
has to be a bunch of things.
>> exactly. especially now because now that
we are being bombarded with the
content. i hate that word
that you need to reinvent the way movies
are made together so that they don't go
to their a boring. i know what's going
to happen. so let me look at who's you
know instagram me or what's happening.
so that goes away because you're aruck
completely in
all the senses are active in in lamus.
uh we have scent, we have haptics, we
have motion, we have 3d, we have
ambisonic sound. all the stuff comes in
together and that's a different
experience.
>> but can a theater screen afford that?
>> that's not our problem. when people make
money they they would have to invest
more money
>> but this
>> even each metro can have one
>> right
>> right
>> and uh we don't even have a proper
symphony hall in any of india nowhere
and musical theater is another important
aspect of entertainment which could come
in because we have so many talented
singers actors here and they're all
looking at movies and if you look at uh
london west end or broadway or canada or
australia they have musical theater and
it travels once you make one big hit it
travels all over the world forever for
like years 40 years 50 years it's there
look at sound of music or phantom of the
opera and we have great stories to tell
and i've seen when i was a kid i've seen
parisham raaneshwar and
that's it now i think the only one which
i keep seeing is smugglas
nothing was significant in india. i went
for the phantom premiere at nmac.
>> yeah.
>> incredible.
and that's probably the one only place
which is world class in india.
>> is it a chicken and egg problem? because
the discretionary spending power of
indian audience is limited to a certain
number.
>> can you just think about an airport?
>> oh, the airport is very costly. let's go
on trains. we can't. it's a necessity
for people need that they they have a
right to have proper infrastructure.
it's very important. there should be
enough places where which brings hope
>> pride you know entertainment
if you don't deliver that they take a
flight they go to germany watched hanmer
and phantom oprah and london and they
come and oh that's so great like what
about the person who can't afford that
why they don't deserve that they also
deserve to see you are influencing minds
which can become the next einstein or
rammanujam or you know steve jobs this
is the way you should insp inspire them
not they don't need to see that only in
america or england our country is now
prosperous enough to it's important to
be in a chorus to say that we need this
>> this is for future india for our youth
for our children to experience all this
stuff
>> if you were to give some advice so our
audience is
>> i'm not i'm not good at advice
[clears throat and snorts]
>> our audience
is largely wannabe entrepreneurs young
from india who want to know what
business to start, what company, what
startup
in the live event space like there's
book my show, there's district, there's
a couple of concert organizers.
if you could advise our audience to
start a business in live, it's growing
the fastest in terms of rate of growth
versus other form of entertainment, what
could somebody start?
>> simple thing.
is finding the void.
um i find void in in art,
>> artistic stuff, [snorts] fashion.
>> mhm.
>> fashion is taken i mean definitely
coming like it's much better now.
>> but even furniture
like this furniture you have here. you
can't buy it.
>> nobody makes it. they make something
very boring. it's copy pasted from
>> 100 years back.
there's no imagination in any kind of
furniture which i see
>> it comes from indonesia or china or
malaysia.
>> i see i see a void there. huh?
>> it's because of scale that china has in
producing these.
>> but we should have scale. we have like
more population than china, right?
>> but they're producing for the world. so
they get the cost. i see the same
>> cannot export,
>> right?
and uh electronics we still don't have
um like my keyboard i wish i play indian
keyboard in my lifetime no it's from
japan or us or germany or london never
from india
>> musical theater of course
>> in my thing definitely musical theater
having an orchestra in every state is
very important having a worldass like a
sphere kind of a thing
>> mhm. changing entertainment.
entertainment is something which people
need. people bored.
>> but if a spear cost $500 million.
>> no, i don't think it's that.
>> no.
>> everything's so slashed up like all the
leds you get so cheap now.
>> i mean at that time maybe it will cost
that much money.
>> not anymore. you think?
>> not anymore. i think definitely with the
latest technology is much it's probably
100th of the price now.
>> right. and you don't need that big a
spear. like
>> would that be something if somebody
comes with a very interesting business
pitch to build one of our young friends,
would you be interested in [laughter]
>> bring them in? we'll create the content
for that.
>> right.
>> we'll create everything,
>> right? [music]
>> okay. i mean, i have no questions per se
left. last part.
>> anything else you want to say? fleeting
thoughts about
the world, society.
what are what is occupying your mind
space that you're actually thinking
about?
>> i stopped seeing the news literally from
2000
2001 after the war.
>> smart man. i think most people should
stop.
>> whenever i tried sometimes, you know, i
forget and go into streaming and i see
and then i get sick. m
>> so i think the best choice for anybody
is to look at your own family your own
welfare
>> your own parents your kids
>> and be kind to your friends with my
neighbors
>> and because if you think about the world
what's going to happen to the world
>> you miss what is going to happen to your
family if you look after your family the
world will take care of itself i think
>> makes sense i think even back in the day
world was going through problems it's
just today we are seeing
>> now we seeing everything like this close
yeah.
>> so every problem looks like big.
>> yeah. like now we wondering why is some
crime happening in some corner of
africa. i'm sure it was happening 50
years ago.
>> absolutely.
>> not that we are insensitive about it. i
think we just definitely have to develop
a great justice system.
>> right.
>> but it's important not to get
disheartened and lose your faith in
humanity because you are humanity. each
one of us is humanity.
>> our good and bad affects humanity. it's
very important.
>> okay. thank you so much for doing this.
would you like to finish with a song? is
it possible?
>> i'll send you a clip.
>> if i give you a guitar, would you like
to?
>> no, i don't play guitar much.
>> i can play if you sing. if you tell me
what chord to play.
>> wow.
>> i don't know what i'm just i'm in the
talking mode now.
>> we can do one minute. it look really
nice.
>> just bring that guitar from my bedroom
now.
>> bedroom guitarist. huh?
>> bedroom guitarist.
>> give me the okay. it's in tune.
>> it's in tune, i think. yeah, should be
in tune. i'll play a chord. you tell me
if it sounds in tune.
>> i think [music]
a minor chord.
[music]
[singing]
>> no. what? what chord is that?
>> a minor.
>> and go to e major.
so e a minor e major.
>> okay.
>> okay.
>> ready? so go a minor [music]

[music]

a home.
