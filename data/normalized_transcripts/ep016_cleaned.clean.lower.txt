when you come from a normal family, do you
feel a need to prove yourself in
the world?
men and women in our normal families
why do you get upset after seeing it breaking?
because we were raised with that mentality
goes. father, husband, all these cannot break.
if the men in my house also break down
when he comes to the brink, he says call shruti.
i want to be that.
do you think that if you are a powerful woman
there is more criticism.
if you are blunt then that will be the problem. which
never met his online opinion offline
is.
smriti irani after a successful career
as a tv actress, she is india's minister.
of education became. today we will know from him a
what is the cost of being a powerful woman?
is. how would she deal with the election loss?
and how come from a humble background a
becomes a motivating factor. what is
it's like to be the inner circle of top leadership
in the country.
there is no inner circle? pm modi is the
circle. that's it.
i saw some clips where you got a little angry.
there's a speech of mind that goes viral
off shouting at sonia gandhi.
apologize to the nation. apologize this country
from. apologize to sonia gandhi tribals
from.
my father had a stroke. i know what i
have lived in that one hour 15 minutes.
when you lost the election, you felt nothing.
because i have lost elections before. i
was smiling and was saying whatever happened good
it happened. imagine if i win the 2004 elections
if she goes
now acting will be fun to get back.
hey, the journalist asked me why are you doing this?
are you sadhvi birthday? my wish. first
they used to say, why made an actor a minister?
you are saying that shruti irani is a minister.
why not make it?
tell me a weakness.
what hurts more? sn actor when
somebody underestimates you. that hurts more
does that as a politician when you get
hate more.
before proceeding subscribe this channel
do it so that we can do more for you in the same way.
keep making insightful and better podcasts. and
audio experience of this entire show
available on spotify where you can listen to us
can follow. enjoy the show.
what hurts more? being
such an actor when somebody
underestimates hurt a lot.
that's as a politician when you get hate
peacock?
know nothing nothing hurts me. it's a good
things when people underestimate they don't
see you coming. so if you still have that it's
a good thing.
you should use any negativity that normally
people don't know how to deal with
as an instrument toward success.
butt like this sometimes
you can't get so bog down. because
the world looks at you because i see you too.
probably from a normal family.
i always thought that in politics you
dynasty says. you are in the media
babies say. now either i
gets trapped in the maze and becomes a victim
caste. or analyze them and yourself
slightly better functioning
professional.
i was very clear that i will not be in the media.
not in politics
i would like to reiterate that i have networked
how made. this was me when i was 24
25
ok
when i'm 49 i realize the potential of
networks.
we
but networks also get with you too three
burdens and disadvantages.
ok?
so you should be analytical in everything.
and analysis cannot happen when you
become emotionally involved in something
in.
so explain network and explain
advantage.
see two or three things i always think about
it was like, hey brother, this ivy leak is in the school.
if you go to study
we
what a big deal. yes
because today it has been democratized
education and learning.
we
whatever you want to read, you can watch it on youtube.
take it. you go to google and search.
you will get it on google research. berkeley
i met my first
who established the school of fintech
had done haas i.e. he is also a professor
are from a normal family.
we
so when i physically went to berkeley i met him
study digitally.
ok.
and when i was studying i was in the cabinet
was in.
we are nice.
so it was very strange for yanni that a
cabinet minister sitting and studying fintech
is. and any of my fintech
had nothing to do with the field.
no. so that is when i met face to face.
so yanni and i exchanged notes.
it doesn't matter what your language is. it
doesn't matter what your geography is.
sometime coming from simple backgrounds
in itself is a chip on the shoulder.
we
which is agnostic
to your culture.
we
that we came from the ground, from the trenches
are. we have to go up.
yes.
so then i realized that when we
were exchanging notes of networks
power. so be it an ivy league school or an international one?
what does a think tank give you?
a foundation for building relationships
gives. so i think that's what
networks get you.
if you network
access to places
access to ination
and new ination.
now many people commercialize it.
it has no commercial value for me
is. just the hole
journey of knowing. in itself is brilliant.
because we see our whole life now
our parents raised us by saying that it is good
there must be a job. we
parents are afraid. they don't want that
you have to do what they had to struggle for.
fell. any parent means mostly parent.
they don't refuse you because they
are jealous or frustrated. just because of his fear
tell you brother i struggled
you should not have any struggle.
taught you because they were taught
i taught you well in a good school.
in college. this means 50% guarantee off
success.
true.
right?
your whole life between check and pension.
gets cut in.
and when pension becomes your reality then
you wish i had done this.
i didn't want to do that. i knew bechek
is important. i am not stupid. me
know that pension is important. i his
made arrangements. me but at that age
i didn't want any regrets. butt
you mentioned three or four times
chip on the shoulder came from an ordinary family. do
you think when you come from a normal family
ho and your ambitions are big and you
it's not like i pay check to pension, friend.
no live. these are all thoughts. do you
feeling is a constant need to prove
yourself in the world.
it's called a chip on the shoulder.
to prove it to me.
when you work, when the world doesn't even test you
had it been there, you would still have been giving the exam.
yes
chip on the
you felt the need to prove yourself
did feel the need to prove myself i think
what takes a lot of people a back
is the tenacity
how dare you mean me right now
no no not that hey man don't be polite
that's the other thing the rich teach there
kids which middle class lower middle class
don't teach
whosoever is listening to us today
your parents always told you this
you must have taught me to be loyal to my work.
we
be loyal to the person who gave you the job.
work hard with your head down
yes
ok your parents told you
you must have taught that a house should be a good bank.
there should be balance to put money in fd
have taught
we taught all this
isn't it
the car should be in good condition, don't show off.
your parents taught you this
rich what do we teach our children?
strategize based on your position
go ahead.
it is not necessary to move forward 12
had to do hour shifts. what about the boss
like? we all see this in the office. we
there is such a chakram which is better than you
is competent
we
who is not so intelligent as many people
that even today i have not learned how
handle that chakram
who will go to 10 people who are actually
working
here's everything that they're doing go to the
boss before the hard worker gets to the boss
see you know what i think this should happen hey
you're doing you know that i have i think the
middle class never teachers
yes yes
that's the one burdened most by middle class people
r bow down v
how to serve the master
yes we
because we were supposed to be humble
loyal hard working and chakram jo hai na
his parents have taught him how to
leverage how to be flashy
our parents taught us flashy
don't be
sitting inside quietly
sit quiet
they still say the same thing today
even today he says the same with a chip on his shoulder
we butt ever because of this chip on the shoulder
i felt as if the world didn't consider me any less.
so i
no it never occurred to me
no never
never never never never
because you have lived in france, right?
we
so you don't want to be the one who
shows off in front of others who harasses
turns off
not that but because everyone is doubting it
no need baby
the world keeps going on at night, we are not there. someone
it won't matter to the world.
it was already in your mind that today this
yes, no one cares. so if you are
going to be forgotten why i waste time.
the only difference is how i've lived my life
predominantly in front of the camera for 20
years. 20-25 years. so i'm sean. but even
if there is no light on and there is no
camera facing me. i'm just the same.
ditto
ditto
has it ever happened that someone more powerful
is human. you know in your head we all know that
who is more powerful? who has more money
the one
there is no powerful secret but this one is the biggest.
i guess not because everyone
yes i saw it
have seen.
this power is a state of mind.
nice.
it is not an individual. it is not a
position. it is a state of mind.
and if you realize that then you can believe
it but how
how do you define power tell me
i don't have a question and then i will
define
how do you enter a room where you know
inherently
that intelligence wise position wise money wise
multiple other factors whatever vanity
matrix is all the wise things of the world
another person in more superior position than you
right then how do you not succumb to their power
and why do you have to circumstance to anything?
it doesn't seem like you have become younger.
no why? never felt.
never felt. it didn't work even when it was sprayed.
not total. that's what i'm saying. power is a
state of mind. if you presume somebody
has more money than you? then look at exact
the context that you set up in a different
fashion. why you in the room?
hmm.
that person with money, that person with power.
why do they want you in the same room?
the fact that you understand that aspect
means who has power?
hmm you know i don't let anyone be more
powerful in this room. i feel very friendly
with somebody who ever has it because it's it's
that may be i have trained myself in
chip on the shoulder.
looks like a chip on the shoulder.
no, if you are doing this here also then
you have a chip on your shoulder.
but i enjoy it here. here i came
won't let anyone be let see
there is no power position here
not the fact that you say i won't lie down
anyone b is power
how do you get off this
don't
you have to live your life to your comfort end
to your truth what may be true for me
what may be my way of life may not be
yours
true
why do you see conformity
if you stop seeking conformity you will
stop next step is stop seeking
validation
wow mentoring session with
no no it's me and you i'm on the other
end of podcast i
it's true why
i don't know that it's always the boy comes
out
no but that's okay that's what keeps you
relevant to yourself it makes you watch over
your shoulder always so any time people tell me
see us again i'm just presuming
hmm
foundationally you and i may have suddenly you known
the foundational pieces of our life which
b. similar, both are from north india
are from normal families. how are we toot
how to deal with life we are never too
if we have someone to convert
if there is a style, what is it? two people
we talked quickly, we spoke quickly, we picked up
up the threads later we call the people
friends. we
ok? when we have these discussions
do it with an open mind. don't hide anything.
do it transparently. now you just
position yourself at work place
and suddenly you are in a work place.
where you feel oh my
has transparency become my burden or my
is being used against. why? because you
this has never been taught.
satyam told you
dharmam char means speak the truth on the path of religion.
come on. and because you weren't taught it
is. you meet them again too
to whom this craft has been taught. we
who have been told. wear clothes like these
meet people. get out of the car like this.
if you meet someone superior then this is how
must behave. because they are watching
that example from their own parents,
their own family ecosystem.
what have we seen our parents doing?
hard work
i haven't learned the trick, i don't know it.
that's not a trick
didn't even learn strategy
that's their way of life
that's why when you confront such a person
yes, they say that sir means charbaaz.
what are you saying because they
life is our own
yes he has life
like there's a big controversy going on here
the dynasty napobi
that's a way of life.
or what do you think should be learned? from all this
it makes a difference to get off like this, wear these ways
live from.
would you be in this room today if you were that
everyone learns?
no.
then
i don't even hit my hands and legs.
so then
and hitting hands and legs. see what the mistake was
is when people like us reach the top and
stop hitting your hands and legs. because
the class that never accepts you
nah. even then it will not accept. whether you
how much you earn, how famous you become. it happens
like this in your life
yes yes 100%
and you think so, friend?
i sat in front of bill gates so much
gone but even today i am for this
i am like this only.
yes
and those people psychologically
let's leverage the feeling. and if you
caught in the illusion that you are their validation
keep waiting for. them on them
develop new strategies by creating a focal point
yes, you do new things. you are defeated.
it is not theirs.
true.
just now a journalist asked me why
have you been there, sadhvi?
my wish.
like excuse me. hey hey used to say earlier
why are you not doing the job? you are saying
why are you working? earlier we used to say hey
why was the actor made a minister? you are saying
yes, why is shruti irani not a minister?
made? i said toss the coin and tell me
give.
what do you want to ask? yes i said it
even my heads and tails will not work for me and many
people, you are very arrogant even with this matter, yes sir.
what should i say to such people then?
do you think that age is not a woman if you
are a powerful woman criticism more
it happens doesn't it
it happens if you are free then it happens
problem
it's a problem with women in power.
hey, what does imvar mean? she's a little like that.
if you apply the tag you will suddenly get power.
i remember de
something called the ipo is international
parliamentary union in luganda
the meeting was in 2012 or 13 meira kumar ji
the speaker was a young man from the opposition.
as a parliamentarian in his team
was inserted
and there was a meeting which means right?
all the women in it by doing networking tee
politicians countries parliaments around the world
some came from so and so, some were in defense.
so and so are sitting and drinking tea. give suddenly
having the same conversation.
how
they have to be doubly alert.
so that they are not looked upon as abrasive
and these are women of the world's end
parliamentarians and ministers.
around the world same.
is the same.
what needs to be kept in mind? tell me more
three things.
no, this is for them. ok and there is
also a generational differentiated position. we
there is a generation of women who are in there
50 60 didn't wear too much lipstick
so that it merges, there is no hair in the background.
used to be made by the best designers
didn't wear clothes so as not to be noticed
in your office because you got notice either
they will face
stiff backlash
and the character would be assassinated. so de r
50 years old who had these experiences.
when you are between 20 to 30 years of age
say you are inexperienced. 30 years to 40
sal me ho den de se that hey aapke toh
there are children. you have exam for board
will need time for marriage
will happen.
when you're 40 to 50 you're told you're making
way for the 20 year old. when you 50 to 60
you might be dead. because you are still
are giving. so it's not easy. i am not
being one of two
feminist.
this is the reality.
so has this ever happened to you?
what?
have you faced all these problems?
no.
i never looked at the problem so carefully.
see
people must be asking and talking. would irritate
will be.
don't know. no one has that much courage right now
not that he should come to his face and say it.
earlier it used to be that from 20 something media
is
she is young, she must be stupid
which was good
we
because they don't see you coming
yes
give give me my you yes okay yes say yes
speak
and then you
give slowly slowly speak speak speak speak
speak, work, work and suddenly have a truth.
huge body audio your work can't deny
u
the problem will be now when you prove
nice and have you felt there i was
reading about it an article ok that
specifically and it was talking about
actually world wide women all around the
world whenever she becomes powerful people
stop loving them like people love them till the
time they are very powerful after they are
powerful than the cases its hatred would change
there is an expectation that you
will be maternal
it's not a wrong expectation it's not a
bad reflection on man it's a bad
reflections on upbringing
we are everyone's upbringing around the world.
what went wrong
how we have created the context of how
may not to be viewed
we said that you are a naturer and that nurturing
if you do something in umbrella then you
accepte force is
your power should not shy away
it should always whisper
if power shakes
then you truly do not understand power
silence is power
wow
absence is power i always say people
to understand the true status of mother after her death.
until she comes, you take it for granted.
the day you call and mother's voice is there
will not come from will come
you will go home
no matter how big a man he is
we
even today
he hugs his mother and cries or even cries
not if you just put your head in your mother's lap.
then my mother realizes that something has happened.
and mother never gives you any explanation.
asking for
father never speaks
so we translate the emotions on a wider
canvas
and you have to understand that it's not
that's even if i'm telling you to the whole world
subtly take in the scope of a family
come
we
is there someone in your family who yells at you?
if the relative likes it or not
why would he enter politics?
why do we people come into politics?
pass?
they come because they need someone
there will be pain.
yes.
some come because they want to become rump rings
want. leave that.
why do most people come to you?
because the problem will be solved.
there is a problem. it means you are hopeful.
you are not human.
nice. or
so what to expect
can it be louder? hope is always silent
is.
you learn all of the things and it was
inherent?
this is me but i've never spoken about me
nah. 15 years i have spoken about my
party. before that i've spoken about
my work is an actor. these are the rare
conversey. nobody asks me all this.
what's the most misunderstood thing about
u?
i don't know. because you are misunderstood in
some matrix by many.
what do you think is the biggest misconception?
i think it stems from the
perception of child careless
as a politician do i deliver yes
to my party i do to my
constituents i do
to parliament i do
as a person who is building policy papers
i work
with the cii the confederation of indian
industries i work with bill gates
do i deliver? yes, i do. as an actor, do
i delivered on set? and do
everybody.
so, people who are engaged with me, there
expectations of me, do i fulfill? yes.
what will i do with the rest, children?
sitting down?
sometimes it's like you know the whispers
about you around?
doesn't matter.
never matter never bother.
no, you should have whispers about you.
otherwise why would anyone pay any attention to you?
true
if you're no whisper that means you are
redundant
or so like it's a little bit of everything
want
no then i am no attachments which is a
i think no scary part about being me
i don't get sword by popularity i
don't get sword by controversy i don't
get sword if you hate me i don't get
swired if you love me
but tell me one time ok think hard and you
have to tell me something but one time were
a rumor or an insult or something that
really affected it got under your skin
they all have that you are spiritually
unaffected you are as a human being i can
from
physically mentally also unaffected
never nothing has got under your skin
ever
even when they attack your family
my family didn't choose
fame attention
do they bear the consequences of it? yes. butt
can i avoid what happens to us? i can't
even if i wasn't famous? won't they have gone
through their own journeys of disappointments?
what they have gone through their own journeys of
backlashers? what they have gone through there on
journeys where they are shattered as people? yes.
today i'm just one factor. we
what makes it happen in their life even if
you remove them suppose i die tomorrow
so is there anyone in my family who
guaranteed that he will have no challenge in life
will not happen
so now i'm a factor i'm not their own
life
we but then it affects you because of you
i saw some clip where you got a little angry
my issue is does it affect me like there is
a speech of mind that goes viral off
shouting at sonia gandhi.
my father had a stroke just 15 minutes
before that.
i am the eldest in my family. i was the
only one in delhi.
i still remember 10:30 i was to address
the press. 11 o'clock was parliament.
10:45 my father collapses in cp connaught
place in delhi. i was at tughlaq
crescent at my official residence.
you are to present yourself to the
parliament of india at 11 o'clock
shop. so what you do? 15 minutes. you can't
get to cp you can get to parliament.
and you don't have the time to seek permission
from parliament.
to sir, i can't appear. why? because
you're taking a position to defend the
president of india.
so you rush. i mean i had nobody then. i rush
my assistants i said someone go and
medanta which was the hospital which was one
our away we
my father's taken into emergency i go to
parliament i mean i know what i have
lived in that one hour 15 minutes
what was going on your head
i just to get him to a doctor and just
to go to parliament finished my
parliamentary obligations
i finished my parliament
obligations went to the speakers room sort
the permission that's because i have to see
permission from the leadership.
ah and sort of permissions. i still remember the
home minister being there. and give the speaker
var in a meeting. i'm sorry but i am
saying this. and i said, sir, my dad just
had a stroke. i need to get to him.
but those are your responsibilities.
you seek permission?
even in that moment.
yes.
and you go and you spend that time between
the hospital and your parliamentary office
till your dad is okay to you know about me
sun i mean
collapsed
first time second session of 2014 winter
session think between aiims and parliament
was on even then it's running none of my
parliamentary colleagues new acceptance
my lead leadership that my kid is in
hospital.
what prepares you for this?
you see so much
that's what your brain just works on
your brain actually works on. this happened, this
it happened, it happened. this is the solution, this
there is a solution, this is a solution. all these solutions
give it. do justice to every relationship. every
responsibility towards the relationship
fulfill it.
but sometimes these pure emotions with your
father, eat your kid yes you
like at that time no logic comes to mind
how do you
that's what i think is your true taste. s
an individual
fair
whether your emotions make you so miserable
takes that responsibility as yours
bears the brunt
so we never shirk responsibility
kept
no, as if mother-in-law was also daughter-in-law once.
we
people talk about my
the baby was three days old when i returned to work.
why was it because at 10:30 at night everyone
wanted to watch the episode
i had a miscarriage.
i was working with two producers.
one of them is ravi chopra who passed away
has gone. from smriti i can actually afford
to give you a week off.
we
but ekta could not afford because she was
airing everyday.
so somebody went and told everything like this
she is lying
this happens to production people, doesn't it ma'am?
we have to shoot, we are ready shruti
irani is not available, she is lying
nothing has actually happened to them so you
hospital reports are taken
it's not for speaking, but it's true.
don't feel emotionally crushed at that time
because you understand
that those who are professionals do not need to hide
behind certain things to make sure that
they don't look bad in front of their boss.
everybody's trying to get a job done.
everybody is dependent on that salary.
does all of this come from a sense of
responsibility and does it come from a boss
order.
responsible also for other people
dependent?
but now it is, is it pure
responsibility? that's the boss's order.
if they do, they will be fired. me
will be fired. this
they were not throwing me out.
hmm.
anyone else would have got trapped. he would lose his job. his
i can't lose my job because of you.
you have there are too many factors at play
when you're somebody like me
it's not me alone
true
so can you manage these factors to the best
of your ability you should
but tell me about that time you dined
didn't answer that there was just any time
when your family member gets attacked
gates to your head
no
anything that is angry from within irritates
no i think what happens is and what
my people who love me don't want
is something inside me snapping
and me wanting to kind of settle that
score like you don't want this woman
settling score
you settle scores
no
never
no i take it as an indication
genuinely
someone's life may reach such a stage
that's everything will be down hell
from now
if they've done this to me it's happened so
any time somebody does something to me
earlier everyone used to enter when i smiled
thee and i long with you why would you
smile and letter when i started
exhibiting the examples are like o father
ray
so i genuinely believe
it will happen
that someone did something wrong
will happen with them
it does not mean that
after 10 20 years
will be right there in front
immediate
you will hear in a month that
startsm
you have to know that you are not where you are
without god's blessings so if it's a
domino effect and you're being pushed and me
somebody don't get pushed back or pushed
forward
you how to realize that you are that one
little thing i realized very early
meaning i started seeing at the age of 13-14.
give examples before me.
wow so you got this realized everybody
no because it happened right in front of me.
i am
give me an x
lucky enough to observe
give me an x means not like since childhood
i sound very very very i was working with
somebody till the last day of the ninth month
while i was also doing because it was
a daily talk show kuchh dil se and i was
told you to bank for 30 days
we
and bank means shoot the episodes in advance
this is for the lay person who's watching and then you
imagine coming back to job after 30 days.
was my first tind just bought a house
i have emi and that means i need doctor family.
he says what are you doing my friend
your health will deteriorate, something has happened to the baby.
so i said no no no no 30 days
after this i will go back to this job and pay the emi.
take it quickly you are 25 years old
and i'm in the hospital after giving
birth to my baby and here i am
fired
right before
just after having the baby
like
and i just shot like a day before
and they were just waiting for me to get in
the hospital to say a fire
and why
just
that she will take a break now, so fire from now on.
tax
yes, now we have made a bank, so this
till then i will replace it, the hard work i have done
i used him to replace me
he intended to start
smiling breach candy tha and my family
like why is she smiling so much
is the pressure on the poor girl or the smiling end?
i think as the first time i told my
family that's gonna happen so they said
why i said i know how to write mostly the
script also i to do everything
idiot him as you do.
i used to do that
for the show
so they hired a film actor for it you know
we'll hire somebody whose exhibits are much
more bigger intellectual bigger name bl bl
bl bl bl i kept mind and the show shut
down and the show never started again
smriti e rani hidden super power
it's just god. it is genuinely god. we
spend your whole life half in regret
are. half is spent in revenge. i
doesn't do both.
nothing to regret.
now you have made this one in one.
such mentality.
no no i always was. look at your
choices will come in life.
we
once you chose something very consciously
suppose the result was not good. we
it's your choice, how can you regret?
yes? suppose you have chosen something like this
left it which became very successful.
we
but it was your choice, so how can you regret it?
will you do? you, in that circumstance, at that time
calculated on the turn of that life.
every person does it. ok.
but nothing happened that i left him
it has become very big. you have to be tune in
every minute of the day. and don't get sweed at
all. you have to know what is an act and
what is reality?
hmm you know online people say you've built a
very intimidating personality. do you think
so?
i don't know.
they are online and have never met me offline.
how do they know?
by the persola. people make their own.
those who never met offline are online
is an opinion.
but it seems intimidating to you
have developed some personality. you have a very
powerful very always personality. i was
always like this. even when we were like,
were standing on the road and i was like, i
will become. i was seven years old. my mother
like you are crazy.
what did you say seven years?
i will become a success. this house i
will buy. b. shit. what does my mother like?
wrong with you? when i came first to
mumbai bombay 17th kamala nehru park
there's shoes there, whatever marine line marine
the drive looks like this, the lights look like this
chamcham, one day i will go to this city
are you crazy from there?
be 17 years old
7 years 17 years everywhere i was like this one day
look, a journalist told me this of yours
what happened
can't you see, brother?
how is this a question? can't you see?
so now i read what people say
manifest. manifest makes me laugh a lot
is. manifest is genuine if you
if you don't believe me then the second one is you.
why would he believe?
when did you realize that i am this?
dreamy.
not dreamy but certain.
yes certain but certain for dreams.
well this dream is reality. this dream
yes, i mean, i have done mills and drops in life.
did not read. i'm gonna read hard voice
i.
if you read 'huddy boys' then it means the kind of fighting ones.
i am that kind of person if you read novels.
you used to say this. but there is no such realization
did it ever come to the point
intake
the realization came on the seventh day that i
yes
i was born to break.
to burst
now it's generationally passed on that
no not yet.
it has happened.
good
it is done.
now your kids are like
yes.
this part will come.
i like this. i am going to use this a lot
i am.
i told them, i said you never live
i may not be able to do what your mother did.
did it. because you have never seen poverty.
you dont no. that's yours
will happen
challenges
which will not be yours.
she won't be there.
tell me what poverty teaches
what privilege can never teach.
ambition tenacity.
and what is the difference for those who
ambition?
burst.
and what is the difference? poverty people
breaks it and teaches you how to break it
gives. some people break, some people
learn to burst.
what is the difference? what u u u u
you think this is different?
i have seen it break. and there is nothing
scary
and to see a male member of your family
cry.
have you ever seen it?
in the scene.
yes. there's nothing scarier than that.
when they are helpless.
yes. i mean, leave the women alone. i have
have seen men crying in poverty.
and if you were raised with this mentality
goes. no, people make fun of it these days.
let's do it. the man does not feel pain. but
foundationally for you
the mail member cannot break. our
in normal families, women and men
why are you upset when you see it breaking?
because we were raised with that mentality
goes. father, husband,
you know father in law
all this cannot be broken.
imagine how much this pages of the family
doesn't speak.
i didn't want to go through that.
that in my house
even those who are men are on the verge of breaking.
when he comes, he says call shruti. i want to be that
was.
that wherever my father is, he is 75 years old.
wherever my mother is, she is 75 years old. my
the family that is related to me is the family.
this is a big thing. who love me
do or those i love.
wherever you are in the world. my cogs
smriti is here. called smriti, didn't she come?
will go. that belief is my capital.
when i was a minister on the set and i met someone
there was no discussion. there was no conversation about covid
in.
one is always access to memory from people
will go.
people in amethi say reach didi
bus
will reach. didi said it will be done
then it will happen. in covid i got one of my
friends are family whose hospital
he said leave it is overheating
numbers. we
whoever called me didn't call me?
feeling confident about the matter, i listened to it.
will take
and nobody should have that confidence broken
if you say i am proud of something
is it true that if you ask me
you are connected in any situation, have you ever met?
you have also shaken hands and accepted my greetings.
have you done or saluted me?
be in trouble. so i never despair
will do. 'cause i know i'm in trouble
to be alone.
when did this realization come?
i was already like this
whatever it may be
no, when did i realize that i had this
i want to become the father of my family.
from before
early.
yes. whatever happens, even from the neighborhood
why not? meaning where father lived
there in new colony in gurgaon
someone sent a message asking for dry cleaning.
there was a shop. i didn't know the room we were in
he lives in a dry cleaner's store.
there was room. we
this is when you're a kid you have no idea
when when i went back i was like good
i used to live in these dry cleaner stores
i and my parents told me in my childhood
it seemed like it took a lot of time to clean the house.
has been
didn't know where we were staying.
we
death of a relative abroad
so he called me at 11:00 pm
messaged in the office
that we are looking for shruti rani. we
lived in his neighborhood when he was 5 6
was one year old. so i thought 11:00
11:15 11:15 11:30 i fucked them.
i said you did. yes so and so
my brother's son died somewhere
is. we have to bring the body back shruti. can
you help? what happened a month ago. no
three weeks ago. good
well, those around here are saying yes.
will not do anything. i said yesterday morning mc
we will open we will call we will
so the next morning i asked whether the call came or not.
when he came, my staff said, ma'am, he did not come.
i called back i didn't call
no one picking up the phone track trace
finally that uncle told my staff this
ambassy woke up in the morning and helped himself but
smriti followed
so if you're someone's last hope
you can't afford to turn up
what in you want to help them you can
you can
how can you not
if god gives you that opportunity
how can you not
raj, no one might have helped you.
but whoever did it, do you remember it today?
all the people
and if god forbid you have
someone from your area will help you.
won't you ask for it?
100%
then what is the difference with me?
because you are in a position where perhaps
you can't help that many people
as many people might be asking you.
this has not happened to me till date.
10 lakhs in the constitution i was in
are voters. it has not happened till date.
how can this be possible?
is possible.
someone must have been left behind. someone's voice
it may not have reached you.
reach out to me if anyone
so he has got help.
so it will be very difficult to reach you.
no.
those who reach always reach.
you are accessible to
everywhere to everybody. one was that of the house
two actors were talking to me outside.
didi, suddenly someone ran away from the cart in front.
i am from amethi. say yes. this to mom
it is hurting. which village? this is like this
sister, this is the police station. will you make a call? his
i had never even met him. he here
working in the city. but he knows
that
sister, will you do it? yes
didi did it.
did it. how many means how many in bjp
workers are like this for 25 years, so many people
worked together.
it is known that x and g have access to shruti.
go or i'll reach out.
friend, you will help him.
ok.
this is a matter of your strength. tell me
a weakness.
i listen to music very loud in my ears
it is mr. dal k.
shouldn't listen.
come on
seriously, that should be discipline.
the discipline of not working out.
i am very lazy. even after doing all this
with the workout you want
do.
you do, you don't like. i that's the one thing
i didn't look after my health you never
have this not a good excuse
but you don't have time
i didn't have time now i realize i
should make time but way difficult
i tell myself not to eat sugar again.
i think there is mawa jalebi in jabalpur.
very bad weakness very very bad weakness
what's what's one insecurity what's
i have heard your biggest insecurity.
i don't be.
tell me, will you be insecure?
do not know? what do you want? something happens inside
so it happens.
what do you want?
you don't train yourself?
no it is not like that. what is?
think about it. insecurity. okay let's do this
let's dissect. insecurity kis-kis
what is it made of?
i don't know who can make someone drink. the way i
talk.
i cannot change what is. neither mine
my face may undergo rhinoplasty.
there may be a lift. and information
i am less intelligent than anyone
i don't have that misconception. yes.
not everyone is omniscient. but yes if
you have the capacity to keep learning i
means you're intelligent enough to know that you
are not completely informed.
we
okay i'll ask this in another way. butt
what's your biggest night mayor tell me
that.
as an actor and as a politician, what
will be your night mayor if it ever happens?
i don't want to be prophetic. i was
very taken a back the way vijay rooney died
in the ahmedabad
i knew him for 25 years 22 years
i know bhabhi anjali bhabhi
so they died along with the rest
that's a night man
no it's not mine
no but that does that care you a lot most
people won't even think about it
i new him.
i saw the photographs of the kids who were
there you know going with their parents too
start a new life.
so i think the death of somebody i know in that
was so close.
because what do you do to bhabhi when you see
every.
i mean i've seen people have seen him s
chief minister politician ble ble ble
see my life in bjp has been lived
somebody who is a part of people's families
or
if i would go to rajkot vijay se hey anjali
shruti has come, the work is done, it is a ball.
bhabhi, take it to feed, always go by wood.
memory what to eat what to do
uc amit shah s you know the home minister
v c bhabhi
you know
give a small example. arjun meghwal is a
law minister right now. his wife bikaner
i know they like a toffee which
found in bikaner. we
these are for the memory of bhabhi boli
relationships suddenly to see it go.
so that
i think
has kind of it's not a night mayor. we
and it's an oxymoron because nobody is
going to inform and then go.
so the contingency of it gives us everything
everyone teaches.
what are you afraid of?
don't feel afraid. i don't know, maybe i'm afraid
that i'll walk in and what if mother doesn't
wake up.
i'm calling what if dad doesn't pick up.
that is
god.
that's almost everybody fears.
that's it.
i know it's going to happen.
we're i'm gonna go. my parents are going
go. right now. i mean i came last night
before having this conversation. my sister
was leaving for overseas. we both don't tell
each other. the only reason she wants to come is
to see amma.
she's going for just
three weeks we
but what if
we don't limit or
so it is
i do childish things like tell my mother you
sleep in the middle of the bed my mother just looks at
me what
we call the child, right?
that the child turned under
don't fall
i would tell my 75 year old mother if she fell.
am
you sit and sleep in the middle, that good humor
it's okay to do it, i didn't panic then
in the middle of the bed so it's a very human hum
you call up my father one day on a sunday you
works a lot is a work
he cooked chole bhature for 14 hours on sunday.
i must have slept after eating these two and four hours.
have done 50 calls on hf ho
he was somewhere in punjab i had somebody go
to his house and wake him up and he likes you
are you crazy
so
i was sleeping sunday
okay i'm asked to ask you a very simple
question ok
ay hi
what is it like to be the inner circle of
there is
top leadership in the country
there is no inner circle
pm modi and you were inner circle like they are
like 10 20 people
pm modi is the circle that's it
what it's like to be in that circle
pm modi is the circle
there's nobody else
but you're in
the other myth that people propagate about have
hey i recommend them hey i
hoover has told you this is just blatantly
lung
there is nothing
there is he who will disseminate work thats
it you work you report that it there is
no underash
there is no inner circle
i think i am
i'm the way i'm a lot also because of
how i watched him
what have you watched it? very precise
very professional very direct no nonsense
doesn't create small talk nothing
work hard to get out you would assume
that's what you know will have an honor which
feeds him stuff
you would be amazed by how much he is himself
driven how much he has experienced
and bring forth on his own what he does is
he will take the best of every field and he
will se x y g with me so it's mine
have experience.
he'll tell me this is the issue this is the
outcome i don't let me be
and that's the best way to learn that's one
of the best bosses to have nobody looking
over your shoulder like this didn't wall that
true
i work with him 22 years
i worked with him when he was chief
minister s well
bean pattern
this work has been given to smriti and this result will come.
leaver alone
how will that memory come?
she will do that with smriti and there is
nothing more empowering for the lack of a better
word then that when the prime minister of
the country knows and your leadership knows smriti
it is given, it will happen
you worked with atal bihari s well and you
work vs pm modi what are the differences
we call him baapji at home. that's what happened
philosophical poet politician.
my interface with him was way different from
prime minister modi because i was a
worker who found a blessed place
among his family.
hmm
so hindon i never interacted as you know
prime minister and
an individual who is supposed to deliver on a
particular project of acid. so, i have
seen a different side of him.
but what are the differences between both of them?
in personality?
prime minister modi is 247 driven.
you've met anyone else. who's like that?
no. that man is all work every minute of the
day.
i've never seen i'm like with you
chill from the guys. no.
nothing.
he is so clear. it's a huge country 1.4
billion people we don't have time to waste
very clear on that
baapji was somebody i had seen 25 years old
he would give you that space to culturally
evolved so i've seen a different facet
off snow
we
you joined in 2003
or
and then
you got your major responsibility in 2014
i mean cabinet cabinet major can speak
organizationally i was in you're from
indore. so tai ji is from indore, right?
i know.
so me and tae again go back 20 years. so
i have worked in indore. i work in yours
city. so ahalya bhai holkar ji's
the palanquin moves, i am one of two people who
done the sedan also.
you were everywhere. i know you've done so
much work, star campaigner.
apart from that, i've been this way
president of the youth wing here in
maharashtra.
twice i have been the national secretary. i
work with five presidents jp nadda
who is the current president amit bhai before him?
i work with rajnath singh i have worked with
nitin gadkari and venkaya naidu s
presidents
how do the taste before giving you any
major responsibility is there a process
i think 2003 is when my first taste
was given by a politician in maharashtra
whose no longer amongst gopinath munde so
munde ji
vaz
off-the-opinion brothers do all the social work.
are.
if you want to bring change, then be a policy maker.
be.
we
because this is a conversation here and i
had and i was working in talasari
here in the outskirt of maharashtra and he
was like ok everyone does it. society for all
have to change. but tectonic shift policy
electoral politics for him if he comes from
is part of. so what's yours what's the
one thing that you want to do? now 2003 there
there are not many young girls in yuva morcha.
it was mostly a male asian. so i
said brother, why shouldn't girls come?
youth wing means youth is as much age as girls are
men and you know women have political
ambitions. even if they are 18 years old and
20 years old. so why should they be?
we
it's fine as is. from an organizational point of view we had
55 districts. so there is one
administrative districts as ah
articulated by govt. one is bjp
from your organization's point of view. so that's it 55
can you find one female leader in the districts?
is in that age group we so i said or so he
like ok ok find me he says we been
trying to find this is your sixth month
target fine went from village to village to
villages across all districts we found
and 50 devendra fadnavis the current chief
the minister was vice president with me at
that time
ah so three of us got together and
across 55 spots we found 55 young ladies
who could take the issue of women leadership in youth
weighing forward in 2003
and i remember month five i requested
munde ji to meet all 55 and he likes it
gone that set like the template that whatever
will do it twice
hmm so then keep tasting you again
like that
they don't taste you than everybody else
assign a project teams are assigned than you
fulfill the standards benchmarks and
outcomes that are expected of dose
projects. 2003 was also when
vasundhara raje for the first time was
presented as rajasthan chief ministerial
candidate from the bjp. so, pramod
mahajan at that time was alive. so, hee head
been departed to make her fight rajasthan end
there's a group of 100 boys who've gone
to kind of assist you know we do the runners
ah the once who would set up offices the once who
would be a part of the philosophical and
statistical team who will do local publicity
who will do coordination in the office?
where will such a leader go?
who will meet communities and all that just so
one of the group of 100 boys
i was the only exception
1001 99 plus one
or
so it's like you're dispatched many a
times as a part of group
and obviously if you're politically very
atune and sharp you will learn
and it dip you're watched on everyone
assignment so you're given the next
assignment on the basis of how well you have
done in the current one
if you're lethargic if you're not a team
player
if you because that's life and death right it's
a small kind of time window where you have
to do the best
so at that time they are enough people here
there is a thing called review
we
so after let's say an assignment to the elders
do sit and do review who did what
bjp is not one of two run of the mill
ok you have come ok you become a leader no review
your attitude is reflected in the review.
work with people
a people outside a citizen's people within
organization even from a microscopic point of view
is seen
do you get trend as well
is there like alert trend on the job on the
job
trend trend on the job
but there is no external like this
there is nothing
few leaders will make sure that we want the
next leadership to come up and we will
train them specifically.
this is training
on the job.
this is training on the job. like when
narendra modi a had this whole program ah
goodwill
s chief minister of
this is the dedicated press interface sriti
will do.
so every leader so let's say when i became
gujarat mp from the first time in half
an hour of me coming back to my you know
guest house after i filled my nomination
that means the result has not even been declared.
filled my nomination from then chief
minister modi's office this whole bunch of
papers and books came that you study
have to do this session of parliament will come
there are issues of gujarat then upa
the government was at the centre. and please
represent the state well. these are the ah
what can you do additionally? so, you wood
study all dose points. you would speak in
parliament, you would learn everything and
then you would say, sir, what if i go to
xyg minister and xyg
specialist and push this agenda for the
the state and the people. say yes to you.
so, you'd come back and you'd report that
sir, i have done access. parliamentary
obviously there is enough the landscape is true
that's what you did parliamentaryly
records are also made in writing and
evie too
so you can't lie this is the place
no where you have punched or
no there is a record of your engagement
so you're tested of everything you think
i sent you somewhere
press conference or campaign
hmm.
so you
how is your disposition as soon as you get off the plane?
with local workers? our feedback
is the system. we take feedback from each other
are. do reviews even today. it's good
what? see you assume a leader's name
ego will come saying hey how did i do this
did it work well or not? it's not like that.
if you joined bjp then you would have won even today.
i worked with workers
all the workers are still in touch.
that and they have to have the freedom in there
engagement with you and after say yaar didi
it wasn't supposed to be like this
like the head of our media cell today
anil baloni is also from uttarakhand
he is an mp
we
even today if i have to talk something i'll call
anil anil do you have any point of view?
it's not always your point of view
party's point of view
true
and at times it's also individual
experiences that you want are leveraged. now
anil is from uttarakhand. ok? his who
the co-convenor is sanjay mehu, he is from bihar.
so if i am going to speak in bihar or
sanjay, what do you think about saying something on the same topic?
hey sister, if it happens like this, it will happen like that. so you
it's a conversation every time. it's a team
work. it is not something that the leader has come
said and left.
it doesn't happen like.
for some it may happen. i have not evolved
as a politician because of anything else but
this method of working because when you
present yourself to anybody and you are
presenting yourself as a bjp person
you're not affecting only your chances of
how you're perceived you're also affecting
the chances of how your party takes your leadership
will be perceived
true
so to be mindful of that
true
like which program did you go to?
it was the government's no to the creators
my training is true that i will watch every
creator. so that has nothing to do with me?
so do you also watch things which have
nothing to do with you?
but you'd see my introduction which is
nothing to do with you and anything
or because i will then study how you pursue the
prime minister.
but that's not me, that's not party training.
hmm interesting. every email that will come
to me and everything that's written about me
facebook twitter
instagram i will know
personally. so even i don't have an inner
circle
that's incredible. how do you keep up with
these things.
because they have enough time in the day to keep up?
typical peak performer person saying this.
all that's what you all say
because everybody will only appreciate you if
they personally resonate with you
ahead people hate to go through hierarchies to
reach you and you have to give people the
respect
off picking up the phone when they call and not
how some assistant get it to you
people sometimes flex it as a power play
that's stupidity as far as i'm concerned
it is much more warm when the person
you're calling even if dev becomes minister
can pick up the phone. say yes.
right? because whatever goes up will come down.
true true
and the only thing people remember is how you
make them feel.
nothing else.
nothing else.
when you did all this, like you how operated.
at that level, now the fun of acting will come back.
in doing. you're coming back.
can your life be only about one thing? no
but now will you be able to accept that?
it will be fun.
what's the fun?
you tell you
that's what i am saying is your definition
what is it? you are younger than me, right? yes. so
what is the definition of fun?
got to learn new things.
yes. so what will i learn? tell.
with acting
i don't know. now. ok now you said that
i have an intimidating personality
we
well now imagine that when i am in the form of tulsi
i will see mir shouting at me
identity of people will be at stake many times
in the eyes
it won't be yours, i was doing a scene.
there is a discussion about my weight in tulsi's book.
we
look how thick his hands are
we
what means your teaching people comfort around
u
hmm
to say this one but what do you convince to the
larger audience
body shaming it's so natural for us to do
it's for people especially women
so am i conveying a very hard truth in
a very very
dramatically acceptable way
this is what i've found for all my life
from a policy perspective they don't
this you know we know better how to judge women
and not by how their bodies look
but can i relay this announcement to a larger
audience i can't have to take a beating
for it myself to relay that information
may be but what is the penultimate goal relay
that information
but do you think people will accept this now
they've seen you like something comes
that's where the acting and the writing
comes. so what you see now is just me
what you will see because that's what ekta
thoughts of the character
we difference
will accept
had i not done so, i would have been sitting at your place.
no but it hasn't come yet
but now like the way i'd see your mine
parents would see you is very different. or
and now if they see the same tulsi again then let them
will be like little
head is the craft
you're coming back because of the craft you are
coming back because you just can't be an idol and
it's okay
like business private sector
good
okay i've been teaching for two years i
been teaching at i am
s agent faculty nobody knew when
i was teaching even when i was in the cabinet.
i didn't know anyone, i didn't know.
didn't come even in research and won't come.
i just gave a guest lecture at berkley
can't enjoy with my professor
fintech. can you imagine?
told the story of fintech
not the same but go to teach and study from there.
coming out is a different matter. go there and teach
no.
i have been teaching for two years. to someone
don't know.
so you are working. busy you are.
what's the real reason?
i run an alliance world economic
on gender in the forum. i will send you
a little on that.
what is the matter.
have been running it for two years.
nice. all this is not very public.
no, no one asked. but it means
no, i am not doing this.
what's the real reason? what do you think
why did you say? yes to this.
cochair of 20's digital transformation
i am. south africa has nominated.
i am with the commonwealth secretariat 55
i am in mou among nations. work there
i do. so there is no shortage of work.
then why are you coming?
experience.
because you see everything nobody gets
to reexperience from a new
perspective the same life.
you're getting the opportunity.
today i tell raj to go there and get relief.
do it. will you reeve differently?
100%
then you are not getting the chance. me
getting it.
true.
i am getting it.
no. we started conversation and that half
i am left with the matter. you said and i want end
it's like that's the second last question
gone. on june 4th when that happened you didn't feel
anything. when you lost the election you felt
nothing.
because i lost elections before.
14 and four. think twice if i
had she won the 2004 elections
so i always tell people that luck
one does not always write victory. even defeat many times
writes.
when you're unbothered by it.
yes because i failed before. i think one of the
the greatest misconceptions people have is
achievement. and achiever means from one
achievement to others. no from one failure to two
another in between some achievement.
right?
so on june 4, my mother's
there is a temple. so i was smiling and i was
whatever happened happened for the good.
next to me oh god didi gone mental
is. what goes on in your head.
nothing came
before the result
planning the next thing.
before the
done with a project go to the next thing.
not before the result what goes on in your
head?
that's only. done. i did that in 19
also. when they were counting and they said
won. i said ok ok let's go
gone. so it's not as if i'm unaffected
because i've trained myself only at
loss. i'm unaffected even when we win.
i love it. let's go ahead, move ahead. i
never went and took my certificate off
victory in 19 which was a historic
political victory because of the indian national
congress has never had a sitting president
lost in the history of this country. that
to from their bastion. amethi is a
unwinnable seat. and the first non congress
person and a first woman to ever complete
five years there who isn't from the family
gandhi family. so i know the history i had
created but i was yes go ahead. the team
which was working in amethi aisa aap jaake
get the certificate. so what are you doing?
i am going home and sleeping.
so it's not as if i'm you know it's a
mind frame to be battled out ah when i
lost something. like that in successful ones.
i love it. i love
beyond a point even because i think so
kept giving every year best actor till i
one day went on stage and i declared it
don't vote only next year.
people like how agentive. i said
don't give genuinely. i mean we are the most
popular. so by that default only come to
as. i told others were doing genuinely
good work. give them and i still remember
like what does she say?
that's being so honest and nice
but it's true that you are our everything in life.
what do the elders say with everything tied on their chest?
will you take it is true for others
leave it because everyone becomes their own leader.
the real legacy is when you lead others too.
create
help others succeed
it doesn't matter if we remember them or not.
do you know that matters?
true i ask this to everybody who i enjoy
conversation we is give me a feedback how can
i be better how to be better
don't
no means you're just fine
just better now, no need to change everything
it is night
i am what i am, i was like this before also.
what is happening people
want to change success success better
in the lust to do
but forget that success happened
why is it? because it is what it is.
you are not a machine that can be increased in horse power.
could. be human.
so why did it reach this point? whatever nature was
she has brought it till here. don't change it.
but you must have seen so many people
even this little bit changes a lot.
there are promotions. so if as a professional
have to improve yourself in every category
read about the person meet people
meet. what has happened to us? to meet
mixing has reduced.
a photographer recently
had a good exhibition.
took photographs of people and their hands
removed the phone. so many people are empty handed
i am meeting. standing in the crowd. the crowd
no one is talking to each other.
meet people and don't meet people who are achievers
meet them also.
who have lost a lot. and at that time
sit with them and put your hand on their shoulder
can. there is no greater satisfaction than that.
because they are the feeling
that nobody will have the time of day for them.
nice. i'll keep that. i'll keep that. i
will i'm still not happy with anyone
feedback but i get your point. i actually
like it better.
everybody you meet is trying to change something
in u.
what we don't realize is human
beings. we're waiting for that one person
who will accept us as we are.
the attraction you have
you are meeting shruti rani who is happy too
meet you just as you are there's nothing about
you that needs to change
and that sentiment is only to other people
