when i was younger um it was very
romanticized that you're going for it
and just keep going and you know it's
like you have to work 24 hours do four
movies in one time you know five shifts
don't sleep don't eat and the more a
person does that the more successful you
will be but as i have seen and lived
more life i've realized having a work
life balance is really important so when
you talk about a beach i was in turks
and kos just recently my phones were off
me and my husband just by ourselves we
spent time we walk walked on the beach
we collected shells um and then i came
back feeling rejuvenated feeling excited
and really motivated to take my career
forward i mean this generation of girls
is fearless and there's so many girls
that take charge of their own lives and
they say you know i'm not going to fit
into the cookie cutter mold that
probably my mother did or my grandmother
had to and it's so like i have
goosebumps right now just thinking about
it i meet so many young women who have
changed the trajectory of their families
because of the choices that they've made
our first episode with priyanka chopra

international audience welcome for an
indian
audience indians welcome thank you so
much r thank you for having me
back i have so much to say to you which
i'll finally offload now please do i've
been waiting for this anticipation has
built to high
levels uh you and your podcast with us
was a turning point in the whole whole
podcast journey and um fortunately we
had first m's advantage for doing the
podcast in india because podcasting
wasn't a culture back that's true that
was right at the precipitated it yeah
and whenever someone asks me what my
favorite podcast was or my favorite
guest was i say you love being a
favorite there's a reason for that thank
you okay which which have not which have
not said online but i will say and i
wanted to say this in front of you um
when you're doing podcast you really
sense the energy of the guest okay and
i've done all sorts of guests like
bollywood military you you name it um
you were the only person who gave me a
very like quiet calming energy you sat
you understood i was like crazy nervous
you calmed me down and you gave me the
content that you knew would work for the
show it was kind of like you were
helping a younger version of yourself am
i calling myself a younger version of
you i don't know could be maybe yeah for
sure but i totally felt that i felt so
much help from you and you didn't have
to but you were so nice and it kind of
also gave me a reference point of how to
just be as a media professional like
you're so professional so thank you so
much oh thank you that means so much to
me yeah it means a lot i mean even i was
a newcomer right at one point i also
started at something different and it's
just so nice when someone understands
what your goal is and instead of
standing in your way helps you pushes
you just a little bit and um and i i
kind of maybe sense that feeling from
you and um i always always like to you
know stand and be helpful rather than be
a um a thorn on your side so i'm glad
that it worked for you no you weren't a
thorn at all should i make it heavy now
or should i warm you up a little bit
whenever you want buddy i'm good i i'm
really good with heavy lifting okay are
you happy in life um yeah actually
happier than i've been in a really long
time okay why do you say that i think i
reached a place where i stopped
struggling with the things that i did
when i was younger maybe it's maturity
maybe it's um being on the other side of
35 i guess and um maybe it is just
having uh my feet on the ground on a
little bit more stable ground um but i
think i'm not running as fast as i was
i'm thinking about the steps i take um
i'm in a really comfortable content
place when it comes to my life and the
choices that i'm making are mine and are
not defined by other people or the
validation that i probably needed when i
was younger so i think that's made me a
little bit more happy and calm okay
while you say all that uh i feel yours
is one of the biggest success stories
that india has ever seen like very few
indian actors or anyone from the media
industry has reached where you've
reached in your life aren't you like
done like like uh why do you want more i
what kind of question is that i meant
see i have this vision for myself that
i'm only going to work till about 3540
because then i just want to chill on a
beach i'm asking you from the beach
scenario sure don't you don't you kind
of want to go on a beach because every
time you take up something new there is
a trade-off of mental health in the long
term but you're just going for it like
you were going for it even during the
last conversation and you're going for
it now so i'm just trying to like
explore what's happening and why i can
help you understand it a little bit yeah
when i was younger um it was very
romanticized that you're going for it
and just keep going and you know it's
like you have to work 24 hours do four
movies in one time you know five shifts
don't sleep don't eat and the more a
person does that the more successful you
will be but as i have seen and lived
more life i've realized having a work
life balance is really important so when
you talk about a beach i was in turks
and kos just recently my phones were off
me and my husband just by ourselves we
spent time we walked on the beach we
collected shells um and then i came back
feeling rejuvenated feeling excited and
really motivated to take my career
forward so this romanticization of work
has to be tough and work has to be rough
it's not work can be your companion work
can be creative work can be something
that gives you joy and now i've reached
a point where that work life balance for
me is most important i will work on the
six verticals that i'm working on you
know my business my production my book
my acting whatever but when i switch off
i'm with my family i'm at home i watch
movies i do whatever i want to do so
then when i come back to work the next
day i have the focus to be able to do
even more things so when you're talking
about retiring at like 3540 sure if you
want to have a shack and goa it used to
be my dream when i work like that too
but i want to have a shack and goa not
wear shoes chap p have fish fry all day
you know and that's what i wanted to do
but as i realized that there's something
i love my job and i love being able to
create in very different ways i have the
privilege to be in a position that not
many have been in and i've created that
by myself i don't want to give it up and
i don't want anyone to take it away from
me it's my legacy for my children and
for the future generation that may not
have even seen the potential of
something like that for themselves why
would i give it up again i feel you're
helping a younger version of yourself
sure somewhere in some other universe
deep sea diving let's
go okay uh you want to know about one of
my favorite new hobbies yeah it's
watching really old episodes of coffee
with karan and then seeing how
everyone's trajectories were in life and
my favorite episode one of my favorites
was the one you did i think with arjun
ramal in season 1 oh my gosh even i i
don't even know what i was what was i
like then you very
different how old must that when was
that season 2004
holy wow would you like to know as a
podcaster yeah yeah i want to know i
can't even 2004 that means that's one
year into me being an actor yeah um i
feel you're even different from like
three years ago because lot has happened
in those three years uh you're even more
chill now yeah like i can i can feel
that uh uh you were very like hyper kind
of alpha when i last saw you in 2019 and
in that episode your deep
professional and what's the word
conscientious you were like that like
you were just you very professional i
think karan said hey you know well done
and all and your response was yeah i'm
just trying to do my best job guys it
was kind of like that i was so nervous i
didn't know anything about the industry
i mean the closest i had come to being
in the business was taking a vacation to
bombay when i was 11 years old with my
brother and was like wow bombay you know
that park where they have the shoe and
theang yeah hanging i had photographs in
the hanging gardens even now and that
was like going to the beach was seeing
the queen's necklace all of that was all
i knew about mumbai the industry was
terrifying to me and i think that's
probably why i reacted like that it it's
it's a great message for young people
cuz lots of people idolize you now
because of what you've done now without
understanding that it takes something as
simple as that when you're beginning
just be professional or just give
yourself a break it's okay you just have
to do the best you can survive keep your
head above water and slowly you'll see
you'll be walking on it m when did you
realize that you're starting to become
successful in
life
um it's a really tough question because
when i won my first pageant which was
miss india i was like wow i've won the
world i'm really successful then i went
miss world and i was like did not even
like i had no computation of again 18 17
had had no understanding how it happened
but what i did understand was the
opportunity it gave me suddenly people
knew me wanted to know me gave me new
opportunities there were movies that
were coming my way i didn't know
anything about how how do you sign a
movie my poor father was a physician he
to didn't know even more and he was like
highly
protective they gave up their practice
and for two working doctors who were
very successful in berele and this
something i didn't even think about till
i was like like 30 years old gave up
everything to pursue my 19-year-old
dream my 19-year-old opportunity is that
even when someone sees your life the way
you speak about it there's a lot of
blessings at like a lot of absolutely
points you believe in karma absolutely
you believe in reincarnation i do do you
think about what you did in your
previous life to get this life now i
hope so i do and i always think about it
like if you think um why do i have why
am i lucky enough to have the life that
that i do and some other woman somewhere
else with the same opportunity with the
same desires same ambitions same you
know needs doesn't have any of it i
really think about that a lot i it makes
me feel like there must be something i
did right i wake up every day with a
sense of gratitude and i wake up every
day with wanting to give back whether
that's with the person that is standing
right next to me or whether that is a a
life choice that i might make make but
giving back i think is so crucial when
it comes to being grateful i'm highly
grateful for everything that i have and
i do think that maybe i did something
right that i've been blessed with the
opportunity of having the life being
born to the parents that i was being
able to have the opportunity of making
my own choices having agency in my own
life if you think about women around the
world so many don't have that that
complete choices are made for themselves
but my parents told me you have to have
your opinion what a
privilege yeah that's that's a part of
the blessing being born to those parents
i mean that's the biggest one probably
yeah completely um wow okay hold on i
got to i got to take my thoughts and
just put them together i made you
speechless no
no ah okay um with this whole journey
and this is a question that's been sent
in from a lot of people who i spoke to
before this chat mh uh i firstly i want
want to tell you that you inspire men
women everyone it's not about you just
inspiring women okay but i think you've
shown a lot of women possibility like an
entire generation needed to be shown
possibility which has happened through
people like yourself uh who was supposed
to be born exactly in your age bracket
to set the tone for like 80s born 90s
born 2000's born i absolutely agree i
was talking to somebody else about this
yesterday a young actor who was talking
in me and i really did say that my
generation of women changed the
trajectory of the next generation of
women my co-actors female co-actors that
fought to be the face on the poster that
fought for agency in the movies that a
lot of women didn't get before us just
opened the doors for the generation
after us and i think not just for women
but people our generation and every
generation will always have a prototype
that'll be better than us because we
have changed the landscape right and
that's a huge responsibility on all of
us i remember maryom being one of the
first female le films now so many films
are that did um commercially well at
that time yeah i remember a mainstream
fale mainam female um and now there's so
many female le films like and that's the
thing like that's another sorry not to
put you on the spot but films are films
and we still talk about female l films
as female le films we don't say that's a
male le film this person's film ahmed
khan's movie oh we're watching a male le
film today i i hear you but i'm also
talking on behalf of the indian masses
completely but that's as a vocabulary we
need to change that female athlete
female politician female actress why
actress politician athlete what is your
message for okay i'm going to ask you
what's your message generally and what's
your message for girls and i'm also
going to give you a supplemental point
and say that this is not the end of the
podast time
not the end of the podcast pc there's so
much more to unpack but i actually do
want to ask you a message uh for young
ambitious women out there my sister um
my girlfriend my my friends everyone had
this exact question for you that what's
the message for the girls who starting
out their careers or who trying to clb i
think it can be very scary um you know
we i mean this generation of girls is
fearless and there's so many girls that
take charge of their own lives and they
say you know i'm not going to fit into
the cookie cutter mold that probably my
mother did or my grandmother had to and
it's so like i have goosebumps right now
just thinking about it i meet so many
young women who have changed the
trajectory of their families because of
the choices that they've made um i think
my message would be that there's a lot
of noise around us narratives yeah and
people that tell us to be a certain way
that people that tell us that you know
um i was talking the other day about
someone that when i went to convent
school i had this thing called moral
science a subject called moral science
which taught me how you know women
shouldn't be um women should be seen not
heard um the lengths of our skirts how
we should sit with our legs um there's
so much that has been told to women that
to be a good girl you have to be a
certain way good girls don't make
history you know what i mean bold girls
make history bold people make history so
if you want to be the lead actor of the
of your movie which is your life you've
got to take choices that might be
contrary to what you've heard and that
empowerment may or may not come from
your parents may or may not come from
your family or boyfriend or whoever
you're around it comes from you and that
no one can do you know i again was lucky
maybe because my parents gave me that
but i try to remind young young girls
specifically that if you don't have that
if you don't have that encouragement in
your home try to find it in your gut
because no one's going to fix your life
but you or try to find it from content
and i'm not just speaking on behalf no
it's true it is really true try to find
inspiration from people that inspire you
i have been inspired every day by
collaborators that i work with the
reason i take new steps is because i see
someone else doing something new and i'm
like
wow but i don't just sit with with that
i think
about what can i do that'll make me feel
how i feel about this person it's about
that feeling it's about imbibing from
the people around you and it could be
someone you admire on television it
could be someone in your class it could
be someone that you work with but when
you see something that you admire about
some someone embe
it all this is exactly why i love that
you're taking up entrepreneur ship as
your next step like very actively you've
been an entrepreneur in the past but
here you're going like all out and
saying that okay this is like the next
big step uh i also feel that uh people
my age but actually younger than me
genen z deeply entrepreneurial everyone
wants to start like their businesses uh
and i'm sure you see this difference
between like ' 80s and '90s born and
then the next one uh how did this
entrepreneurship thing start pc like
where did it start and how how far do
you want to take it i don't know i don't
think about the future i'm not someone
who i plan for the future but i don't
think about how far i can go i mean who
knows what my future holds for me but
what i can think about is my present um
and like i said i like to embibe from
people that i know you know your your
future is so bright that there's
conspiracy theories about you that youve
made deals with the devil to achieve
this level of success that you're a
satanic
worshipper it's that level of success
you very upset with me
huh sorry but go on go on um no i i just
think that like i told you i like to
embibe from the people around me when i
was becoming an actor i didn't know
anything about acting so i used to sit
and watch my co-actors i used to sit and
watch why they did what they did so this
came from a really funny thought my mom
as soon as i turned 30
she she's entrepreneur she's a doctor
she created her own business um but when
as soon as i turned 30 she t me down and
she said look you're in bollywood your
shelf life is over you know nobody all
these 50-year-old actors only want to
work with the girls in their 20s so
after 30 you're not going to have a job
very much you know just like you have to
start planning for your future so what
about making your own movies you know
starting production and that at that
time is really funny considering i'm 40
and i'm still have a very active acting
career but it was foresight on her end
um in an industry which which kind of
told women that that you know when
you're in 30 sorry you're too old um so
i started getting interested in
production just thinking about the fact
that i was going to lo lose my day job
um and then that became really
interesting to me the business of
entertainment started becoming in really
interesting to me i used to talk a lot
to my producer friends producers that i
was working with what are the choices
they make how are movies made so you
have a cost of production you have to
recover your cost of production to make
profit so i started getting into to uh
what margins look like and just
understanding that and that was
fascinating to me cuz it's so creative
um there are so many ways to be able to
create something and i think once i
started doing production um and i
started working in america i i knew my
manager happened to a be a venture
capitalist and she was really into tech
and stuff so i was very interested in
and at that time she was just a
collaborator but i really got interested
in investments
um and i started with small investments
in little things and then those things
became really big like bumble so when i
brought bumble into india i mean bumble
changed the dating scene in india
especially for girls and and that just
showed me the power of being able to
have a new idea and the idea at that
time was when bumble was launched around
the world and whitney who's a dear
friend of mine and launched it she left
tinder to make bumble because she saw
the gap in the
market that you know we want to be able
to create a safe space where women have
the first opportunity where women can
take the first step and that was such a
brilliant plan and what i said to her
was india needs it the most because of
especially the unsafe circumstances
within which girls have to survive and
live in sometimes in india and it's
being used in tier three tier four now
absolutely how beautiful is that like
again i have goosebumps just thinking
about the fact that this came from an
idea so ideas are what was really
interesting to me and then being able to
work with people who can help me execute
ideas is what really started the
entrepreneural um journey in me first i
started with investments and anomaly is
my first brand that i founded myself
with the help of mesa thank you with the
help of mesa that were um who are market
leaders and leaders in incubating new
brands specifically in beauty um and and
then nika of course bringing them but i
really lean on my partners to learn from
them and i just love the fact that you
can have an idea today and monetize it
why not it you're not re you're not just
um reduced to i won say reduced to
because i come from a family of doctors
and engineers but at that time in my
parents generation and the generation
before that it was doctor engineer
lawyer military government job like
those five or six things that everyone
had to aim for but today like i think my
generation of parents are not going to
have those boxes for our children right
you have an idea let's run with it yeah
i have this little crystal ball with me
everywhere that i go that only i can see
and it shows me the future oh yeah i
think you're going to be a
multi-billionaire going for from your
mouth to god's ears please remember the
moment we had before the shoot began i
said i don't want to talk to you until
the camera started rolling and the
lights went off i crystal
ball but i also i also generally want to
talk about that crystal ball a little
bit mhm and what it tells me everyone
knows that going to america was very
good for the career the material aspect
of life i feel it helped you a lot as a
person as well uh america does have this
very different entrepreneurial energy
it's got like this little like accepting
energy as long as you're willing to work
hard the country just accepts you uh
you'll be able to create further
opportunity yourself but now i will let
you unpack i just i feel i feel it's
been great for you and uh the harsh
truth i'm going to say it online is that
india finds things cooler when they
become cool abroad and then come back i
mean that's a fact like swami vi is used
as one example that's our that's our
colonial background we still haven't
been able to shed that you
know you know we have a lot of equity on
um on things that come from the west
that i agree is a fact um but no it's
not it's not the easiest thing to be an
indian in america yeah it's not easy
even
chopra said that felt that i mean yes
i've had a i started working in the
states in
2010 and in
20 20 after 10 years of working in the
industry i started with music and then
pivoted into acting in america so
started in 2010 for context in 2020 i
got my first leading role how long did
it take me 10 years so people don't
think about how much hard work how much
consistent knocking on doors how much
humility it takes to go to another
country and start from scratch i had
built an incredible career here an
amazing credibility here and um i got an
opportunity to do music and people were
curious about the fact that cuz i could
sing what that could be and i'm a big
fan of the music industry anyway we um
in ind monopolized by bollywood when it
comes to music so much for now i hope so
i hope so that we've not really been
able to bate into pop you know pop music
or pop culture when it comes to music
it's still very niche so i was really a
big fan of like music and musicians and
um very excited about that opportunity
went there worked with the most
incredible musicians and quickly
realized that i'm not as good as them
you know um and i should go back to my
day job i don't like i'm very um astute
when it comes to i don't lie to myself
i'm very honest to myself so i did the
music i love the music that i did for
myself but it wasn't my standard of
excellence it was good it was fun played
on the radio it was successful sold a
lot of cds but it
wasn't my lane and that made me want to
dabble in acting as well and see if
there was an opportunity there but it
required me to strip every single thing
that i knew in india and the laurels
that i had achieved in india the awards
that i had won the movies that i had
done the box office successes that i had
seen it required me to walk into rooms
with extreme humility and introduce
myself to people to take my show re and
say this is the work i have done i would
love to work with you i would love to
see if there's an opportunity with you
um i remember i had to do i mean i've
done so many small roles in big movies
in hollywood um but that's what it took
for me when i started here too a lot of
people used to say to me oh she's left
um doing bollywood movies to do small
roles in hollywood it started with every
new actor starts there you have to start
with from the beginning and i don't sit
with that um you know if you're if i'm
successful in one country that everyone
in the world should treat me like i'm
mcain it doesn't work that way so which
is the case for a lot of big stars most
people most people and i don't know
about that but most people expect and
anticipate that if you are treated a
certain way or if you're making a
certain amount of money um in a certain
country you're going to be treated the
same way because everyone is waiting in
hollywood to cast you right they're just
waiting for priyanka ch we were just
waiting for you to come only priyanka
change the trajectory of movies of
course hollywood is not the same without
you it doesn't work that way you have to
go you have to pound the pavement you
have to walk in you have to be rejected
you have to audition and you have to
work around the culture of a new country
and that was so hard i had to swallow
the humility pill and i was willing to
do that hard work and then 10 years
later i finally got my leading role in a
movie i finally got the same
renumeration as a man which i never did
in bollywood i have never got the same
check as my male co-actor even if my
part is the same even if i've held the
movie as much as i can finally i got it
in 2020 one after 21 years of working
so it seems like oh my gosh america was
so great for you and hollyood was
awesome but the tears that it took when
you move to a new country with no
friends no family working with people
that don't know you and don't know what
you are able to achieve when i first
started doing quantico my co-actors did
not understand the hoopla around me they
were like why is like who is this person
like why are you you know the lead of
that was the first time i got a lead
role in a television series and they
just couldn't understand why and it it
it required me to just you know be
humble and say i'm okay this is a new
environment it's it's easy to go you
know fishing from your boat but when you
have to go deep sea diving it's a
completely different thing so you have
to learn according to your environment
so no it wasn't easy it was very hard it
took a lot of sweat tears and blood from
me to finally be able to reach where i
have reached so when you say you know i
i don't want to pass off um the work
that it took to get there and the time
and the commitment that it took to get
there but look at you now look at me now
i'm still at the beginning that's what
i'm saying it's the first movie that i'm
doing with as a lead part who knows
where else i'll go again the the
mainstream narrative though on you is
that things have just gone upwards i i
love that you're saying this because i'm
not someone who um talks about my
struggles too much why don't we talk
about your struggles a little that's it
okay you have to ask me the questions
did people try jeopardizing your career
here there at any point because that's
the one thing i'm slowly learning about
success like the moment you start
climbing that ladder there's too many
people who don't like that you're
climbing the ladder and try pulling you
down i don't know unfortunately i feel
like in india we've been taught that
mindset we are not people as a people
very few of us are happy for somebody
else's success because we
we again i think my hypothesis and i
don't know i'm i'm not someone who's a
expert on the field but my hypothesis is
that you know we were colonized till
1947 i agree we just about not even been
100 years we've just about been our own
country our own people it's divide and
rule but on an emotional level exactly
and our generation has to recognize is
that our generation are say hold on hold
on why is my natural instinct when
someone is successful is to be jealous
why is my natural instinct when someone
is successful to be envious why is my
natural instinct not saying wow you've
done so great let me add on to this
person let me push you forward because
then you're pulling me forward there is
such a strength in numbers which we
don't recognize if we only collectively
ed together and supported other
successful people in our fields we would
be unstoppable in the world we are 1if
of the world's population but we've
never been able to take our own stand
because of that reason i feel this is
something we can learn from the west
they cheer each other more than what we
probably probably i don't know about
where that learning comes from but i
just i just like you i've also had
people wanting to jeopardize my career
take away from i don't know take away
from work make sure that i wasn't cast
just because you know i was doing well
in what i was doing but that's not what
stop i don't sit and wait and um hop on
i mean maybe i'll cry one night or the
other when an opportunity was taken away
from me but i don't sit in the [ __ ] you
know you can sit in the [ __ ] and then
you'll start smelling of it and then you
don't even know you're smelling of it
because you've got so used to it so then
you just become dark and negative and
you'll never move forward you have to
shut off the noise there are many people
that'll want to pull you down but don't
focus on that focus on the one person
that believes in you focus on the light
little sliver of light that you might
see a little bit of inspiration that you
might see and that's the hardest thing
to do because you're bogged down by
baggage you're bogged down by shackles
of people holding you down so you have
to really push forward and that's just
individual do you have that inside of
you to fight that fight for yourself or
are you going to wait for somebody else
to do it that's an individual choice
let's talk about that little sliver of
light yeah
i don't know how else to put this but is
that god for you is that the higher
power i i mean a lot of it is i really
do believe in destiny i believe in i'm
i'm i'm someone who has a lot of faith
um i pray uh a lot what do you how do
you pray and what do you pray for i do
puja almost every day i do gratitude
what's your interaction with the higher
power thank you and it starts with thank
you it starts with thank you for my
health thank you for my life thank you
for my family thank you for my life uh
lifestyle thank you for my ability to um
be a nice human being to be a grateful
person um and then i'll ask for a few
things too what are you asking for now
pc um manifest it i don't know i i i
mean i don't know i don't think that i
believe listen a lot of people believe
in the secret and the vision board and
all of that but it's not something that
ever worked for me i tried it i had a
vision board i put [ __ ] up on it and i
was like okay this is what i want to
achieve but i didn't focus enough on it
for it to work for me what has always
worked is having the small next dream
you know um the next step so that you
always have to take a step up in the
ladder to be able to get to the top you
can't get to the top by flying up human
beings don't fly it's a way of saying
manifest something achievable yes and
then slowly you'll turn around and you
say oh wo
look at this legacy i've created but if
you have unachievable dreams something
that seems too out of the ordinary then
you're waiting for a miracle and
miracles don't happen very often you
have to create it for yourself so what's
the next step in your big dream so if
you want to buy a car say for example
you have to figure out how much it's for
so so you have to work backwards from
your goal so if my goal is one thing
i'll work backwards and what is the
first step in that goal i'll take that
then the next step in that goal and
slowly you'll buy your car what would
you like to change about this whole
journey till this point is there
anything you like to do differently yeah
i'd like to tell my younger self not to
have stressed out so much i used to have
a lot of anxiety around losing my job
losing my position losing time that's no
because that's a very very common thing
now with teenagers with college
everyone's afraid that they're getting
too old when they're 18
i mean i'm not afraid at 40 of getting
too old yet um yeah well that'll that's
your glass ceiling for you right there
what do you mean i mean you're telling
yourself you're too old at 18 it's like
everyone's aging that's the one thing as
a fact we know birth and death that's
going to happen to all of us you have to
age you have to like that's something to
really come to terms with early on in
your life i feel aging feels really nice
like it it makes you feel very chill nor
why are we putting so much equity on
aging that's the one thing we know that
is going to happen what is the stress
around it you're going to get older i
mean yeah i feel like i did when i was
still 18 but like i'm going to get older
and who am i right now at this age is
what's important what is my best
opportunity at 18 at 25 at 35 at 60 who
is it that you want to be i was just
doing an interview with fal n she
started and started naa at
50 like that was her idea and she built
it into an empire today so age ain't
nothing but a number that's a real real
fact we put too much equity on age it
just doesn't matter what matters is what
you do about your life in the moment
right now yeah it's also the people
around other people telling them that
they're getting too old so then don't
keep those people around you break up
with them bye peace out keep the people
around you that are your champions and
maybe this is also something i realize
when i'm older but i tell young people
this all the time do not hang around
with poisonous people do not keep people
around you that are toxic that mess with
your brain keep people around you that
are genuinely happy with happy for you
only people that are genuinely happy for
you and whether if that's two people
you're a rich person yeah meeting you
was a very big turning point for me i
mean i'm saying that again in what way
just saw what you are in truth you know
in in reality who you are right so many
people put on masks on the show even
today i've done you are 12th episode
i've done 400 now wow and we still have
lots of people putting on masks and
you're just the same person you're very
real very professional very very polite
i can sense people can sense the
kindness and that's the joy of
podcasting that you really get to know
who the the other person is over a long
nice conversation like this um but it's
not easy to be a public person like you
know i we we talk a lot about and we
point a lot of fingers at celebrities
and public people
it's a really hard job it is so hard to
be dinner table conversation every
single day it is so hard to walk into a
room and know that somebody's going to
be talking about me when i leave good
bad ugly not my control it is so hard to
wake up every morning and know that i'm
for public consumption and my it can be
an opinion that is completely the
opposite of who i am people could think
i'm unlikable people could say that i'm
a horrible person people could say i'm
unprofessional that's not my truth but i
can't change that opinion so if i sit
and read every comment or every you know
negative thing on social media or keep
wondering about the paranoia of when i
walk out of a room what is someone
saying oh my god i'll never be able to
achieve anything but it's so hard cut
people a break cut public people
everyone aspires to be a celebrity
everyone is like oh i want to be famous
and i want to be in that position but
nobody sees how hard it is like it is so
hard when you are going to a shadi
suppose your sh and everyone is talking
about you and pointing fingers at you
can you imagine how you'll feel do you
still go for family functions and all
that can you can you because of the same
fame angle means you reach like this
level of fame i i can't imagine so
you're saying i'm not going to dance on
the barat of my brother's wedding maybe
maybe of course my cousins my brothers
we family is most important to me my
fame is a byproduct of my job it does
not define me my fame is not my job it's
very clear to me i'm not famous for a
living i work for a living and fame
comes with it so it's not something i
can control that's something that's
trust upon me the reason i'm asking you
such like incisive questions is again
i'm trying to learn like here yeah like
you're you're setting the bar for other
media professionals and that's what i
meant the last time as well i realized
that this is what it takes you know this
this kind of professionalism this kind
of energy uh so don't get me wrong no i
don't get no i'm not getting you wrong
at all i'm i'm just trying to elaborate
on something that people don't really
think about sometimes you know um public
people even though you're seeing a
celebrity or someone everyday on like
billboards or or
magazines there's still a human being
behind them they also like to eat par
and aar they also like to sit in a like
we also like to sit in a palti and dance
at the barat of your cousin and make
sure that you get you know great food
and the cho the desires of a human being
is the same m the needs or at least the
people that i know i keep my friends my
family i'm a very grounded person i come
from the ground and i'm going to stay
there and the day i behaved a certain
way my mom would put a tuple on my head
and say come back to earth buddy does it
happen now because i don't need it i
don't come from a place of arrogance
okay gotta i never did i mean i may have
had a little bit of that when i was in
my early 20s where i was like wow i'm
famous everyone knows me and then
quickly i realized when six of my films
flopped that it doesn't last buddy you
have to consistently keep working so i
never rest rest on my laurels that's the
that's that's your downfall right there
all right too much to absorb here i do
have one final too much gan you always
me give this is great that's how we get
the
views thanks for the views pc uh so
anyway views are like drugs for
youtubers but any true okay uh so here's
my honest question uh in terms of
success i genuinely mean it when i say
that like in the modern day you're one
of the most successful human beings on
this
planet after seeing so much success what
have you understood about the meaning of
life what has life become after this
like why do you have to keep going why
can't we all just go to beaches or
meditate or become monks you again okay
what's what's your meaning of life i
think the meaning of life is having
purpose we're born and we'll die what
you do in between that is your legacy
and if your legacy is you know walking
with sand between your toes and living
in a shack and and being happy and
meditating sure it's an individual
choice success is very subjective to
each person is their own my success
might be complet completely not
attractive to somebody else's success
you know so the equity that we put on
you know you're the most successful one
of the most successful people on the
planet whatever great that's my version
of it um you know but somebody else's
version of it could be completely
different but i really believe that what
your purpose in life and what you do
between birth and death is is what
counts so the pursuit of anything else
is just futile the pursuit should be
what am i doing in my life what do i
want to do in my life who do i want to
be who do i want to touch what do i want
to create do i want to create or maybe i
don't want to create and all of it is
fine as long as you at peace with the
choices you make so make choices that
make you feel peaceful gotcha all right
pc another epic episode any signing off
notes um well the only thing i'll say is
the one thing you didn't talk about was
i'm very excited about um the multiple
things that i do but the one thing i'm
really and the reason that i i i've come
back and i really wanted to come back to
bombay but launching anomaly in india
really helped me um you know have a
reason to come back right now
cuz you always have a home in
bb but you know like becoming a founder
was terrifying cuz that's not what i do
it's not something i knew um but
creating hair care understanding why do
i want to get into beauty makeup skin
which one should i do what is the gap
that learning of creating a brand which
i'm so proud of and not for the fact
that oh i've created a beauty product
but the fact that i found a white space
which i could create a product that you
would have spent five times more money
to buy and indian uh the indian new
consumer is very aspirational you know
we want to take care of ourselves we
want to look our best we want to get the
best brands in the world we're aware um
especially that gen z that you're
talking about but we're also aware about
what we're putting in our systems we
want to eat good we want to try good
stuff so i'm very proud of anomaly
because it hits that trifecta it's
sustainable we make all our packaging
from 100% recycled trash from ocean
bound plastic to landfills so we pick up
trash and we create these bottles and
because we're making our bottles from
plastic trash we didn't spend too much
on it that gave us more of a budget to
have really excellent formulas and when
you use it you will know please keep a
bag for ran um looking forward be
bathing in some anomaly tonight yeah you
will um and another thing is that
marketing has always told us men's hair
care needs and women's hair care needs
are different hair is made of the same
stuff don't fall for this marketing
thing is for anyone who has hair on
their head um please use um and also the
fact that it is clean it has none of the
bad stuff that usually for um formulas
and shampoos do if you read the
ingredients of any shampoos you'll see
things like sulfat silicons like that
stuff should not exist in your shampoo
mineral oil exists in shampoos mineral
oil goes into your car why is it on your
head can you imagine what it is doing to
your scalp and your system it's crazy
but to be able to create something which
is clean affordable sustainable and
excellent at the same time is something
i was really really proud of and um when
we brought it to nika we on the first
day sold one anomaly product every 7
seconds and that just was amazing to me
and then we had repeat customers and in
the last 3 months where the top 10 hair
care brands on nika and they have like
some 400 500 hair care brands so it just
makes you feel really proud of the fact
that you've made something good and
whenever you make a good movie it's the
same feeling or when you i'm sure you
when you have a good podcast like this
like yeah like this one hopefully like
yeah man i did something good so it's a
really good feeling yeah priyanka chopra
sharing her blessings with the world
that's all i'll say i'll say one more
thing though uh i think it's just the
beginning of your business career and
you're going to like really flourish
that same energy is going to enter this
and it's my crystal ball
it's telling me the truth it's telling
me the truth uh you're one of those
people who just touches something and it
turns to gold no it doesn't just turn to
gold in the longterm pc you have to work
towards making it gold see that's your
perfectionism speaking it's not it's
just the truth you cannot touch
something only midas could do that you
cannot pick up something and say it's
going to be great it took a year and a
half of research of trying anomaly on my
friends my family my team they were all
my lab rats sitting and thinking about
what the font should be where the rose
gold should be should the trash be up
front what the um smell of it should be
all of that takes work you just see the
end of it and you say it's gold it's
gold because of the work that's gone
into it yeah i i meant that you're a
manufacturer of gold and you said you
believe in reincarnation so what if the
modern day midas is like reborn as
priyanka chopra oh boy what a
thought i wish you i wish i had a
collection of real gold buddy i'd be so
rich i think you do it's just not the
gold that the world recognizes as gold
it's all the blessings that are with you
the blessings that you spread pan chopra
thank you for blessing trs again thank
you so much the last time was a turning
point this time it's going to be a
rocket i know it so uh i'm saying this
extremely humbly but you're a good luck
charm trust me thank you i hope so
especially for our team but generally i
wish you so much luck and love and i i
know that you know you've expanded and
done so well so far and i hope your
trajectory is always just up thank you
one day i will repay you i don't know
how but i will it means a lot thank you
so much thank you pc of course so right
after this episode i felt extremely
enriched with information i felt
motivated and i felt sure that the
podcast is going to take off once again
because of all that good luck that
rubbed off on us my hope and request to
priyanka chopra is that she visits us in
our home studio because this room and
this studio brings out the best best
from
guests sometimes we're limited on set
because of multiple reasons mostly it's
time constraints but i feel that the
culture of podcasting is improving a lot
in india i remember when we had done our
first episode with her india didn't even
know what podcasts were honestly i
didn't know how to podcast if you go and
actually listen to that particular
episode you'll be able to tell how far
we've come i actually hold a sheet full
of questions back then that's how early
we had began this journey and now we're
almost 400 episodes in with a hindi
language podcast as well hoping to have
priyanka chopra on that one also hoping
to have her on the english podcast once
again and he was wishing her all the
best for her entrepreneurial journey
