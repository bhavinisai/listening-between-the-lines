what's your message to all the young
verat Koh watching this and young Jima
rodrix is watching this who will take
the country further you know I'm so glad
you used the second name I think when I
watch the women's uh League it's like
watching a new emerging uh kind of
activity you know Vikings would always
invade with the women as well okay all
right we need to be Vikings now you
notice I'm not disputing it so why are
you doing this podcast
you know I'm doing this podcast one
because I like you
huh that's right ladies and gentlemen
this is Dr Jay Shanker the minister of
external Affairs on TRS possibly the
most requested episode we've had in the
longest time because we've done so much
geopolitical content and this Legend has
come up so much on the show that we just
had to bring him on TRS keep in mind
this is a very short episode there was a
time constraint because of
schedules on that particular day so I
couldn't podcast exactly the way I
wanted to with Dr J Shankar but it's a
beginning you're going to see an
incredible episode of TRS up ahead
special thanks to my go of India for
making this happen this is my mid-20s
dream to talk to this man considering
how much he's done for the country
considering how he's Rewritten the
country's branding on a global stage
this was a great ice breaker with the
legend as I said earlier I was a little
nervous to speak to the cabinet
ministers but Dr J Shankar made me feel
extremely comfortable that's his actual
real life Vibe if you're a young
motivated Indian and that's what this
particular episode one with Dr J Shankar
was about it was about the young the new
and the motivated India I hope you enjoy
this particular episode I hope every
single young Indian watches this episode
because to be honest jokes apart we're
living through some intense times and we
need to turn to people like Dr ja
Shankar for guidance about the future so
I'm going to let you slip into the
episode it is a slightly shorter episode
we will come back with a much longer one
with Dr Jay Shanker but for now enjoy
this legendary piece of PRS
[Music]
Dr J Shanker the most requested podcast
possibly that we ever had how how are
you and why do you think that is well
I'm good uh been a busy few weeks uh but
uh I would say probably people are more
interested in foreign policy nowadays
nowadays uh
uh and maybe they'll come to watch you
you know so I mean geopolitics is one of
those subjects that people have been
lapping up only recently but lapping it
up heavily and you're the postero for
everything that's happening correct
geopolitically for
India uh okay that's good to know uh but
uh you know I in a way it's it's natural
look what do we do most of the time uh
you get up in the morning first thing
you do is reach out for your phone right
muh and see what is it you missed when
you're sleeping M what it's done is it
has connected us completely to the world
Y and because of the phone and then you
build everything around it uh once you
start getting used to Global content and
Global comparisons then you know what
you eat what you read what you think
everything becomes Global yeah we are I
mean that's why they call it
globalization H okay
uh simple question for you who is Dr SJ
Shankar the man like that people don't
know I'll tell you why right now you're
very popular on shorts and reels for
your very aggressive uh comebacks and
your very aggressive responses and in
many ways I feel like Virat kohley and
yourself are the faces of young India in
some ways this is how IND there's a
slight age difference with us no but
you're still you're still the guy young
India is like cheering for when we see
you up there talking to all these these
people from other countries like y
that's that's the response that they
should get look uh you know I'm a
trained Diplomat whose General sop is
you know keep it play it cool uh uh sort
of don't make too many waves
Etc uh now partly I have transitioned
into being uh a political pH okay but
even I would say the Diplomatic side of
me which is still very deep uh uh after
all I've done it for 45 years maybe more
now uh it's like this you know I'm very
uh nice to people who are nice to me
when I get
pushed I think it's natural to push back
and one of the things that has been
happening to a bit is in the last year
year and a half people have been pushing
a bit you know so so I feel I mean it's
it's you you raised you brought up vat
kohy and Cricket anology you know if uh
you get a few bouncers you you you want
to you want to do something with it no
hit that pull shot yeah okay um you know
when you say the sentence when I get
pushed in many ways your I get pushed is
actually when India gets and you are the
personification of India on a global
scale keeping that in mind I want to ask
you why why PM Modi said that you have
abbut thoughts uh no I I not he didn't
exactly say adut I think he
said look to be very Frank we got off a
plane I was myself a little bit zonked
getting off the plane uh and he was
talking about uh uh just outside to a
group of supporters and uh I guess I I
didn't ask him after that okay I guess
what he was really saying is look this
guy has watched a lot of people come and
go uh so he's seen a lot so maybe you
should talk to him and ask him what you
know what's different what's your guge
what's different yeah about you no I
don't think it was so much what he was
talking about me he was actually saying
that look guys talk to him because he
will tell you how much you know uh the
prime minister's visits have changed how
much foreign policy has changed how much
the has changed so it was more his uh it
was my thoughts rather than me as a
subject that he was talking about and
that's my my take of I think it's one
and the same thing whatever okay I had
ishant Sharma on the show yesterday
cricketer and he spoke about how after a
certain point because you've played so
much cricket and you have so many
experiences that you've had your pattern
recognition improves some people would
call pattern recognition Intuition or
the sixth sense I am 100% sure that even
on a geop itical scale there is a role
of your Sixth Sense absolutely I agree
with you can you talk a little bit about
this like a slightly higher level of
pattern recognition or even go one level
higher than that is there like a
spiritual aspect I mean I use that word
cautiously no look what happens is uh
there is this is partly experience but
it's partly also hard
work any business you again we are using
a sports but I would use it in my own
own line of work uh you you spend a lot
of time reading other players
understanding their game you know their
their play how how how does it work
their mind games which they try on you
so you try to see patterns in other
people in other countries in other uh
you know other foreign Ministries
Etc just like you do in sports so in
that sense there's something very it's
it's a competitive activity so if you're
going up against a
competitor and I am a very competitive
person okay I mean when you ask me that
bit I I absolutely let you know I mean I
try to work out as much of it in sports
but I still have a lot left over for my
real business so when you when you if
you are a competitive person the all the
time your six sense as you call it is
working on you are you know one part I'm
listening to you but if you know I've
seen you do this before we've talked
before
I've seen I prepared by watching you or
studying you before the six tense takes
over so sometimes you know when you are
in a situation people sometimes ask you
saying oh did you think about that line
before I didn't I mean that six sense
takes over at that time because you
already kind of you know it's moving
faster than your mind and it's actually
telling you okay this they're going to
hit you with this so already processing
it so you you you see that coming at you
before it actually uh comes at you so uh
that's I would say it's more like a
Instinct you called it spirituality I
wouldn't go that far but you know sure
uh uh there you have but you know I I
just want to round off the earlier point
you ask me what you know what did pm
mean by that what has
changed I think one part is we really
living uh under
Prime Minister Modi in a different era I
mean he has been in many ways personally
transformational he's he's churned the
system in in a very very radical way I
mean I you know I joined the government
when another Gujarati was a prime
minister maraji Desai okay so that's how
far back I go huh a lot of people of you
know your listeners would be wondering
okay what the hell is he even talking
about no no huh he still the poster boy
of young India but but but look uh it's
not often you get people in any line of
business leave alone in something like
running a nation you can have the big
thoughts you know the Strategic ideas
the Grand
Vision very seriously you have the the
Revolutionary Concepts that you chart
out okay there's a different way of
looking at a problem that's one skill
and then you have going down to the
details saying okay this that you know
this needs to be tweaked that detail
needs to be looked at this problem needs
to be fixed guys you haven't done uh the
backup on this
usually there are talented people
inspired people who get the big picture
there are people who are very grounded
who who kind of uh go down drill down
it's very rare to find it in one person
and that I would say to me is a very
singular quality of prime Mr Modi and
that makes it very in a way very
interesting to work with him but it
makes it very challenging because he can
challenge you right up there he can
challenge you right down there you know
in what's your current challenge look
it's the world's a tough place right now
uh you we barely come out of this covid
thing um you had this Ukraine conflict
uh and all the the consequences which
came out of it you know uh energy food
inflation
fertilizer uh if we had not handled it
well uh we actually you know the Indian
consumer today the average person you
and me it would have actually hit us in
our
pockets you know we would have we have
seen much higher inflation we'd be
paying much more for our oil than uh we
are so uh I'm actually looking at the
world when at a world where everything
is coming at me at the same time you
know there's a health issue coming at me
there's an energy issue coming at me uh
I have a set of Border problems on the
boundary border areas with the Chinese
uh I have the pending or you know the
old problem with the pakistanis who you
know have have uh uh been doing
terrorism for so long and at the same
time I'm growing you know my people are
traveling abroad and for me one big part
is how you know foreign policy is not a
kind of of a board game or academic
exercise it actually affects every
person so in my own mind it's it's like
how do I get this foreign policy for you
you personally right you know how do I
secure you when you travel how do I look
after you when you get into problems how
do I make sure if you're a student uh
that you can work on the side and
support yourself or that you know you
don't have to wait for 2 and a half
years for a Visa by a foreign Embassy so
it's as I said I've also learned it's
the small things it's the big things you
got to get them both right uh the one
truth I've learned about geopolitics is
that it's money oriented if you have the
money it helps you geopolitically the
second truth I've learned is that and
this I've learned in the last three days
speaking to the cabinet ministers all
right is that the role of entrepreneurs
is Just Do Your Own Thing create
employment increase the exports of the
country help the country become richer
um would you like to give the youth and
especially entrepreneurs any other
geopolitical advice when it comes to
this I don't want to use the phrase
India versus China but this whole
scenario how can we help no I look I
think you're smart not using that phrase
India versus India versus China for this
reason uh yes we have issues with China
but that's not the only issue I mean we
have to be fundamentally competitive you
know uh if I uh if I do not have the
factories if I do not have the uh the as
you say the entrepreneurship the
businesses the startup the agriculture H
uh the infrastructure it's not just the
the Chinese the rest of the world will
also run over me so you know it is at
the end of the day there are roughly 200
nations in the world okay okay maybe
about 125 maybe much smaller okay after
that once you start grading them there
will be a Zone okay there'll be a zone
of countries who constantly compete with
each other they could even be friends
you know the US and Europe are friends
they compete like
H okay so you would have a Europe you
have an America Russia China then you
add you know maybe countries who are
economically smaller than us but they
would compete in certain Fields you know
so I mean say for example you have a
Vietnam a Vietnam is a much smaller
economy but the fact is Vietnam competes
when it comes to certain kinds of
investment okay so the bottom line I
think what the young people need to know
is that today it is all about building
strengths that when you say make an
India when you say startup India when
you say GTI shaki you know you need
nobody's going to manufacture in India
if you're infrastructure is lousy okay
so they need to see the you know the
smart ports to good roads the rapid
movement of goods now if you have to do
all this if you really need to create
jobs to me at the end of the day it's
all about creating jobs and
opportunities there are many roads to it
even foreign policy I would say
especially foreign policy is one route
which is our job is also to market India
to Brand India to to make India magnet
so that the rest of the world says okay
these are responsible Guys these are
safe guys let's go and do business you
know they're not going to steal your
stuff M okay basically Chase Excellence
create employment ABS uh and as we move
forward in this Chase of individual
Excellence you will achieve National
Excellence absolutely ABS absolutely in
the sport of global I mean in the global
sport of geopolitics absolutely all
right well well said uh when you meet
one of our rival Nations foreign
ministers like we saw you doing the
Namaste to baval BTO H what is your
interaction with him which the news
doesn't capture which only podcast can
potentially capture and what's your
interaction like with say the Chinese
foreign minister if you meet him
diplomacy is a is an art of detail in a
way okay there are a lot of nuance you
know body language how you dress what
you say how you look how you hold your
hands or don't hold your hands so all of
all of this uh
counts uh you it depends on the person
it depends on the situation it depends
you know the the cont relationship yes
yes that also okay so you try to use uh
you try to use it's a bit like a
choreography so you you use that
occasion to do the signaling I I could
modulate it uh depending on that so it
would it would depend on on the
situation so there are times and
occasions uh so I I wouldn't say there's
a single formula okay uh very raw
question for you so pardon me if I'm
crossing a line uh what's the most
pissed off you've gotten at one of these
meetings I'm sure something would have
been said that just irritated you as a
human being and what was your response
and you don't need to name or you can
name if you wish you know rarely by
personal things because mostly I've
learned to absorb it uh it it sort of uh
uh I take it's power for the cause for
me what happens is things do get under
my my skin and I I give you a recent
example I've spoken about you know I was
getting I was actually landed I forget
from Bangalore or something on a plane
and I saw this picture of this guy
climbing up the Indian High Commission
in London and trying to pull down a flag
absolutely it got under my skin so uh or
if people you know they try and score
points you know I I personal points I
just shrug it okay I put but if if I
feel in some way
the collective
eye in some way is demeaned or attacked
or something yes you know that's when
when I said when I get pushed okay I
that that I as you rightly said is not
me the ey but I the India but that sense
that somewhere if you're not given the
respect or you're not uh if your people
are
condescending or sometimes people Ambush
you okay and professionally when do you
feel the most alive like when do you
feel that you were born to do exactly
this uh that's a feeling which kind of
grew on me over a period of time uh part
of it was you know I actually studied
international relations which is not
that usual for people in
diplomats now I'm uh I'm only the second
foreign minister who's actually been a
diplomat Nar Singh was the only other
guy uh who been in that so in a sense uh
you know my studies my my first long
profession my current uh my current uh
responsibility and even I had a brief
break in business even that was
International I was with the Tata group
and they gave me a kind of role in
international business so I've been do
in that sense that feeling that you're
bound to do this frankly has grown a lot
and uh in a way you know I also came
from a household which was very
International I live International I
mean you know my family relationships
are international I spend most of my
time International
so uh I guess it's sort of in you okay
but at this stage of your life is there
any moment occasionally you know I do
give lifestyle advice to younger people
rarely rarely mostly when they ask okay
I I don't dispense otherwise I tell
people look if you like if you really
like doing something you'll be very good
at
you the problem with most of us is we
end up doing things which are not
necessarily what we want to do it's what
we're told to do it's what we told to do
you know circumstances make shock okay
so for me look I always like reading
about the world I like listening to
music of the world I like eating Global
Food sometimes consuming YouTube
podcasts yeah so so so you know it's
been a a mix of all of that so that what
you say you're Bor to do it yeah sure I
mean all of this gets into that yeah you
you it's it's a natural okay all right
uh this is a question that comes from
the engineer inside me are you following
the AI Revolution based on whatever is
happening in the world I'm sure you
are I mean that was just an intro to the
question okay that's podcasting
techniques uh let's talk a little bit
about the role of AI
I would love for you to also give an
input on the role of quantum Computing
because it's come up in geopolitical
conversations uh how do you look at it
from your perspective the future of
technology I don't know if you watch
this uh show called Black Mirror no I
haven't okay it's about the technologies
that are upcoming and you Noah Harari
says that the stuff they've shown in
Black Mir is so realistic it's either
already happening or it's going to
happen in 5 to 10 years or it will
happen once you watch the show possibly
because science fiction determines where
science goes but uh do you
follow uh whatever is happening in the
world of engineering technology and how
do you look at it affecting our country
our forign policy etc etc you know I'm
not an engineer and I'll give you what I
hope is like a common sense answer from
my perspective and I'll take you back
actually to your first question sure you
ask me do I watch
patterns okay sure I watch patterns
that's how I do my business that's why I
think I can be good at my business now
just imagine I am humanly because I have
limited capabilities as human being I'm
watching the patterns of 200 people who
I deal with every day imagine if I could
process the patterns of million
people okay that's the world which is
you are talking about that I each one of
us we are like a
walking emitter of electronic patterns
okay you know what you download what you
say what you listen to what you buy what
you
eat you're creating I mean earlier on
there would have been a pattern but you
couldn't see it okay today that pattern
is organized it is actually become a
business it has become politics it has
become strategy it is actually at the
end of the day this this how do you um
sort of Mega process patterns and that
then gives you a fantastic Edge so I
mean imagine imagine a Virat kohle who
has at his
fingertips everything about everybody is
ever going to be batting
against and that's a dream world is it
be able to predict each delivery each
strategy so maybe the way we should
build out artificial intelligence as
humans is we should develop an aias
assistant for you for you to be able to
you know don't worry it'll happen is it
already happening you never know okay um
how often do Quantum Computing
conversations come up because it's come
up on the show from a geopolitical
perspective the first country that
cracks it will right now actually if you
ask me what's right on our plate it's
much more semiconductors you know
there's this whole Chip War uh which is
going on you can say a tech War which is
going on uh so a lot of what we are
doing today is about that uh and uh uh
it's about uh how do you actually
prepare for an era where you know uh
sort of chips you can say is the new
oil and uh uh in fact I you know I I was
uh a week ago in Europe uh and uh uh
thereafter with the PM in at the quad in
uh in uh Japan and a big part of those
conversations were really about how you
know countries cooperate to ensure uh
what we call trusted collaboration which
is uh countries who have that uh faith
in each other who have similar systems
we use the word like-minded you know
these are normally market economies
democracies sort of uh how you know
people with companies who
follow company ethics and rules like we
know how do these countries really come
together together and create a kind of a
supply chain now here's the bit which I
think particularly your younger
listeners should look
at uh there was a time 10 years ago
maybe about 78 years ago even I used to
go around telling people saying you know
look uh you need to open up your economy
more you know Mobility there's Indians
who be looking for uh opportunities to
work because we we really start
especially under Prime Minister Modi he
one thing keeps dinning into us you know
think of the world as a global workplace
okay this is one like regular message we
get from him in every possible way as a
global workplace Global workplace that
don't think you know your work
opportunities could be anywhere now it's
your job in foreign policy to open up
those doors okay you know why should a
talented Indian be restricted okay now
if you are going to work everywhere and
this doesn't have to be rocket science
okay I mean you have people working in
merchant shipping and Air Cruise in blue
color jobs in professional jobs a
chartered account any profession you
take how do you actually give a full
kind of uh space for Indian talent to do
its best now coming back to this I find
because today we are moving into that
Tech competition or Tech War Z
there's a huge demand today for trusted
talent for people who play by the rules
who understand how the international uh
you know business systems work skilled
people talented people and these are you
know these are the age group you know we
are looking at kind of below 35s they
are massively in demand uh in the world
and we just came out of Australia we did
a Mobility agreement uh the week before
I signed one with Austria Austria you
know is not a country which you reg
immediately think of in terms of uh
migration uh done it with Germany with a
number of European countries and even
with the US you know prime minister is
going to be going there next month a lot
of it is look uh how do we create the
flows now these kind of flows are going
to be very different it's you know it's
like the world you are very familiar
perhaps more than me your habits change
people don't have to leave India anymore
to work somewhere the global workplace
doesn't mean you shift your place it
just means your employer doesn't have to
be in the same town or the same country
you know or the service you render
doesn't have to be there so that's the
kind of world you know we are getting
prepared for so for me if you look at
the at the tech space uh the global
workplace the mobility the semiconductor
the what called critical emerging
Technologies this is really what is
sucking up the oxygen when I was growing
up in the 2000s and early 2010s you'd
often go for family functions where the
families would encourage the kids to
leave India and that used to piss me off
when I was a kid why do you want to
leave your country let's do something
for the country maybe that's just the
cricket fan and me talking but it led me
in the right direction more than half of
all the engineering students with me in
college left the country uh a lot of
them wish to come back I want you to
directly address those people who are on
the fence about coming
back how do we reverse this brain Rin
problem that's one part of the question
two please address the parents who still
want their kids to leave the country and
please address the kids who want to
leave the country for whatever reason
look uh you know I I I would put it I
would Define the issue differently from
you sure if you define it as you know
brain drain here's our country there is
abroad why are you leaving uh you making
it a a kind of choice which you may not
necessarily get the outcomes you want
okay I put it to you very differently
it's you know the world's like a kind of
a membrane huh you can go in and out and
actually that's what's going to happen
you know I see you know I actually
encounter a lot of people who do a job
go abroad do a job come back go again
abroad the days when you said oh if I
leave a foreign country and come back to
India my you know oh my God maybe I'll
never go back again now that's no longer
the case so what you say yeah sure maybe
10 15 years ago that's the way the world
was I think we need to today recognize
that uh you know there was a time when
you said a short-term job is what is the
employer's preference for a lot of
people today would actually say okay let
me take this but I'm not sure I'm going
to commit my entire life to this that's
also happening so the job is changing
the people are changing Mobility is
changing global economy is changing I
think you're going to see a lot of this
up and down uh uh you know movement and
people will also realize in many
industries that actually you may get an
opportunity in India which may be better
than an opportunity abroad yeah yes we
have too many Indian Steve vaks sitting
in America right now who've studied
gained experiences of working in tech
there we have a lot of Steve Jobs is in
India who are looking for vncs to come
back here and build the kind of
companies that we're seeing built out in
Silicon Valley
so do you have anything to say about
that is that correct
thinking look uh I I uh I been to
Silicon Valley a few times I see changes
even in Silicon
Valley uh Silicon Valley today is much
more interested in The Valleys of
India that's also happening so it's not
like it's not like escape to Silicon
Valley and guys now I found Nirvana
anymore anymore sure sure I I think you
seeing a lot of people okay you know out
there coming back you you know after all
look even for people out there when they
now see uh I mean you take the example
of Apple
okay you know you know why it's been an
important event is it's had a very
strong resonance at different levels
it's had a resonance in manufacturing
it's it's a it's a kind of validation of
an improved business
atmosphere it's also by the way a
testament to the quality of people they
find now this frankly this wouldn't have
happened 10 years
ago so it's it's a very good example
look I can always tell anybody you know
everything is much better 10
years now you'll say okay show me the
proof to me that's a proof you know when
you actually have uh good global
companies
and the other uh interesting thing is
when you have Indian companies the big
ones who actually now saying you know
maybe maybe I'm going to invest bit more
in India uh I don't need to necessarily
hedge by going out uh so that to is a
factor so things are happening okay why
are you doing this
podcast you know I'm doing this podcast
one because I like
you I but two uh I'm also doing it
because I feel today you need to
to get people to understand what what we
are about what the government's about
what the world is about and different
people uh different people absorb
differently okay you know there are
still people I mean the beauty with
India is you have uh 20 different
mediums spread over 200 years all of
them are still working h
you know it's like having an old model
that's also working and the latest Gizmo
is also working so today manat also
works okay newspapers also work but it's
it's who you are talking to okay so you
know this is a different set of people
I'm talking to different generation of
people I'm talking I would love to
believe that my podcast audience is the
one that wants aggressive growth it's
the verat kohes of uh the future of this
country I hope so uh so considering that
these are all extremely aggressive
leaders one last question for you on
this chat and I hope it's the first chat
of many many more CH that we have
eventually what's your message to all
the young verat kohes watching this and
young Jima rodrix is watching this who
will take the country further you know
I'm so glad you used the second name
because uh I mean I I actually this year
got really I mean it's something which I
followed for some sometime but I I think
when I watch the women's uh leak and I
and I find that's something uh which is
also really you know when you it's like
watching a new emerging uh kind of
activity uh but uh you know Vikings
would always invade with the women as
well okay all right we need to be
Vikings
now let's go uh you notice I'm not
disputing
it but uh the uh the no look my message
would be different era have self-belief
I this the the kind of
opportunities the the the uh the
possibilities of this era are very
different uh I think today is very
important at one level you know I spoke
about thinking big uh and thinking kind
of practical deep
detail similarly I would say we need to
look at the big choices we make the
national choices we make we need to look
at the personal choices we make they're
not diversed from each other a good
sound National Choice actually widens
your personal choices uh and I you know
look anybody with age wants to be
younger okay it's it's a natural feeling
but truly for someone who's today say 20
there's a world waiting on them for to
happen uh and and I I uh I think it's
the obligation of people like us uh to
to sort of open that up as much to
prepare it as much to create that kind
of favorable ground and when I you know
maybe the next chat we should do this
actually you look at Indian cricket and
Indian diplomacy I I think there's a lot
that they could learn from each other
that could be a subject in itself wow
okay um so many more tangential
questions just related to that thought
um
one last question there's also a lot of
YouTubers and I would like to say
extremely early thought leaders maybe we
are because we do influence a large mass
of people what's your message for them
do what role do we have uh for our
country look I I think the uh today you
honestly don't have to be experienced
which is another nice way of saying a
little older to to too late you know
leadership can come from a young person
conversely you know there are there are
people uh who who may be older who would
relate to a young person precisely
because they have that kind of
confidence you know I I was I I was very
struck I was reading something which PV
synu had written and one of the point
she made was how is it that Narendra
Modi is today a Youth Icon
you know why is he a y it's a very
interesting question it's worth thinking
about so I think that's a good note uh
to end this session so I I too look
forward to another one uh at some stage
I've given you an idea today but always
