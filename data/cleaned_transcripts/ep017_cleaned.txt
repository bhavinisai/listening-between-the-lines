Inside the Right Sanskar,
This is the Conversation I Had With You Even Met
You a part.
I thought so. But Imagine We Met At A
Party, We Would Be Speaking Like This For
Like really a long time. But it's very rare
That You Meet People That You Can Really Engage
With and have a conversation. especially for
Me, very difficult.
Or no, no.
Again, One of Two Episodes That I Knew
Gonna happen.
Or honestly even before you message. i have
Seen you on Rennels show back.
Renals I Remember Oh My God.
2017 and 2018
or that was my initial
Entry into this world, right?
Munna Michael
Munna Michael Ya.
And My Thought That That Point Was O Need To
Host Nidhi on the shot some point.
How sweet? So it's taken a good eight years,
Seven years?
Since Years It Took Its Time But Divine
Timing.
hmm
Could Have Spoken You for Six More Hours.
I think so because there's so much I feel like
I Still Have To Say But Great Ya.
You know I mean at the end of this I just
Like to say I'm looking forward to yours
Next two three years.
I thought looking forward to my marriage.
Marriage also. I know you want to attend.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I Think I Think the Next Three Years
Of your lives are going to be very magical
And I Say That Because I Feel Everyone
The External World Becomes the Internal World
And your internal world is like full of
Magic.
Thank you.
So like that's what I've felt
Everyone has failed.
Yah.
Just Wish You More Peace and Spirituality
Energy That You're Accumulating Because of
Practice Whatever You're Doing. because of you
Definitely doing something. Or.
And It's Helping Every Room That You Enter.
So, thank you. Thank you so much. Means a lot.
It Was Lovely and I Have the Most Amazing
Conversation with you. You are a lovely person
And you have such a clean ora and such a clean
Heart and you work so hard. It's not easy
To Make It You Know Where You Made It To. So
I am super proud of you.
Thank you. Thank you. That means a lot. that
Means a lot. ah hope to see you again over the
Years. yes for noise
ok thank you thank you
Jai ho
