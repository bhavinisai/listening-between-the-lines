[00:00:56.322 - 00:00:57.504] Guest: She was telling me earlier.
[00:00:58.145 - 00:01:00.949] Guest: Putting you under the bus?
[00:01:00.969 - 00:01:02.031] Guest: She doesn't speak much.
[00:01:02.051 - 00:01:03.293] Guest: You also don't speak much.
[00:01:13.909 - 00:01:14.269] Unknown: I told you, right?
[00:01:14.289 - 00:01:14.670] Unknown: I predicted, right?
[00:01:14.690 - 00:01:16.934] Guest: When you speak Tamil, I can understand it.
[00:01:17.294 - 00:01:18.476] Guest: Because I'm also a South Indian.
[00:01:19.257 - 00:01:23.724] Guest: And I've grown up all my life in Bangalore.
[00:01:23.744 - 00:01:25.106] Guest: So, Kannadiga.
[00:01:25.378 - 00:01:26.720] Guest: Half Kanadi, half Konkani.
[00:01:26.960 - 00:01:31.807] Guest: Dad is from this town near Udupi called Uttiyawar.
[00:01:31.827 - 00:01:33.129] Guest: And mom is from Mysore.
[00:01:33.149 - 00:01:34.471] Guest: Have you been to Bangalore much?
[00:01:34.791 - 00:01:35.933] Guest: Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:35.953 - 00:01:36.233] Host: Eighties.
[00:01:36.954 - 00:01:38.196] Guest: Yeah.
[00:01:38.216 - 00:01:38.937] Host: Quite a lot.
[00:01:38.957 - 00:01:40.879] Host: Used to work for a Kannada industry a little bit.
[00:01:41.200 - 00:01:42.421] Guest: How is the Kannada industry?
[00:01:43.483 - 00:01:45.245] Host: Kannada industry is now rocking, right?
[00:01:45.666 - 00:01:49.151] Host: There was a dormant 20 years, nothing happened.
[00:01:49.171 - 00:01:49.752] Host: After the grades.
[00:01:50.653 - 00:01:51.334] Host: Now they just leaped.
[00:01:53.337 - 00:01:54.418] Host: I met...
[00:01:54.530 - 00:01:55.431] Host: I sometimes wish all of them.
[00:01:55.551 - 00:01:57.934] Host: I call them Zoom and wish...
[00:01:59.115 - 00:01:59.896] Host: They're doing much better.
[00:01:59.916 - 00:02:03.800] Host: The Kantara music composer, Grisha and everybody.
[00:02:05.682 - 00:02:07.164] Guest: So you grew up in Chennai?
[00:02:07.304 - 00:02:09.507] Guest: Most of your life has been in Chennai?
[00:02:09.527 - 00:02:10.388] Host: Most of the life in Chennai.
[00:02:10.548 - 00:02:11.869] Host: I was born in Chennai.
[00:02:11.929 - 00:02:12.570] Host: My father...
[00:02:14.012 - 00:02:15.934] Host: Yes, used to work in the studios.
[00:02:16.695 - 00:02:21.540] Host: And then we are in the belly of the beast near Kodambakkam, our house.
[00:02:22.081 - 00:02:23.442] Host: Here, all the studios used to exist.
[00:02:24.578 - 00:02:32.850] Guest: So maybe we start by making you a little bit awkward and getting you to speak about your life so far.
[00:02:32.910 - 00:02:36.675] Guest: Everybody knows you and I'm a fan.
[00:02:36.755 - 00:02:42.022] Guest: I've heard so many of your songs from different eras and I love them.
[00:02:42.243 - 00:02:45.567] Guest: I wish I could sing better and then I would have, but I can't.
[00:02:46.469 - 00:02:48.051] Guest: My mother used to be a music teacher.
[00:02:48.792 - 00:02:50.354] Guest: Classical karnatic music.
[00:02:51.074 - 00:02:53.277] Guest: And they tried to teach us everything.
[00:02:53.397 - 00:03:03.071] Guest: So I went to classes for guitar, piano, flute, mandolin, everything.
[00:03:03.631 - 00:03:08.438] Guest: But I discovered after much effort that I have zero talent.
[00:03:09.479 - 00:03:10.220] Host: No, it's not about talent.
[00:03:10.240 - 00:03:11.622] Host: It's about leaning in.
[00:03:12.784 - 00:03:12.884] Unknown: Yeah.
[00:03:12.904 - 00:03:13.425] Host: Never give up.
[00:03:18.292 - 00:03:20.114] Guest: Tell us a bit about your childhood.
[00:03:20.898 - 00:03:26.205] Guest: It feels like you're a... or from what I've heard, you're very introverted.
[00:03:27.166 - 00:03:27.267] Unknown: Yeah.
[00:03:27.287 - 00:03:36.539] Guest: And now you're more open to speaking because... as you have said, your ability to articulate has gone up significantly.
[00:03:37.080 - 00:03:37.620] Guest: What changed?
[00:03:38.542 - 00:03:50.738] Host: I think when I was growing up, I was... went through all this... the death of my father, my grandmother, and then...
[00:03:51.362 - 00:03:57.188] Host: conflicts where I was just seeing trauma every day.
[00:03:58.389 - 00:04:03.714] Host: My mother was a single, very, very confident lady.
[00:04:03.754 - 00:04:05.676] Host: She took all the pain.
[00:04:06.217 - 00:04:07.838] Guest: At what age did that pass away?
[00:04:07.978 - 00:04:08.239] Host: Nine.
[00:04:10.080 - 00:04:19.730] Host: And she had to go through, protect us from... And she was so strong that withstanding all the kind of humiliation she
[00:04:20.514 - 00:04:21.896] Host: Singhan Lee brought us up, right?
[00:04:22.216 - 00:04:23.618] Host: Encouraging me to go into music.
[00:04:24.219 - 00:04:26.041] Host: She decided for me that I should be in music.
[00:04:26.081 - 00:04:27.983] Host: So I've told that many times.
[00:04:29.165 - 00:04:44.023] Host: And so in a way, I felt like I should be clean because I had three sisters and me behaving in a certain way would also reflect what's coming back.
[00:04:46.305 - 00:04:50.130] Host: And I was, my whole childhood was with
[00:04:50.722 - 00:04:54.166] Host: 40-year-old and 50-year-old, 60-year-old in the studio playing music.
[00:04:55.608 - 00:05:01.615] Host: And I missed all the fun with friends and all that stuff at school, no college.
[00:05:03.257 - 00:05:04.759] Guest: What year did you stop going to school?
[00:05:06.361 - 00:05:06.682] Host: 15, 16.
[00:05:06.742 - 00:05:08.924] Host: Same, actually, me also.
[00:05:08.944 - 00:05:09.565] Host: You also?
[00:05:09.986 - 00:05:12.148] Host: School is not just about education.
[00:05:12.168 - 00:05:13.870] Host: It's about understanding humanity.
[00:05:13.890 - 00:05:20.018] Host: It's about seeing each other and getting to know the stories and learning
[00:05:20.322 - 00:05:22.825] Host: things from other kids, their families are different.
[00:05:25.908 - 00:05:27.390] Host: That I missed, definitely.
[00:05:27.630 - 00:05:29.692] Host: But then I got the...
[00:05:29.712 - 00:05:38.342] Host: I was with the intelligent people in the studios, great musicians in the studio, which also inspired me to reach up to more musicality and play more stuff.
[00:05:38.722 - 00:05:39.963] Host: Your dad was a successful...
[00:05:40.023 - 00:05:40.984] Host: He was.
[00:05:41.445 - 00:05:49.874] Host: So the story is like, dad lived in his house, father mother's house, and both mom and dad,
[00:05:49.986 - 00:05:57.495] Host: um, they are close with thrown onto the streets, said, get out of this house from his family members.
[00:05:58.876 - 00:06:00.398] Host: So he had to go search for the house.
[00:06:00.698 - 00:06:01.879] Host: So he took a rented house.
[00:06:03.281 - 00:06:09.848] Host: And then to get us a house, he worked day and night, worked in three different places at the same time.
[00:06:10.669 - 00:06:18.258] Host: So that one story is that his health went basic because he, anyway, that's a dark,
[00:06:19.138 - 00:06:23.564] Host: side of my childhood memory.
[00:06:24.606 - 00:06:25.667] Host: That's why I never speak of my dad.
[00:06:26.188 - 00:06:28.011] Guest: You have vivid memories of this age, right?
[00:06:28.031 - 00:06:28.251] Host: Yeah.
[00:06:30.294 - 00:06:30.555] Host: Yeah.
[00:06:30.715 - 00:06:36.944] Host: I think after that, to forget what the trauma took ages, right?
[00:06:37.184 - 00:06:38.326] Host: And has that memory changed?
[00:06:39.367 - 00:06:46.738] Host: Now it's changed because I think it was such an inspiration because every musician came from his
[00:06:48.066 - 00:06:49.648] Host: whether it's a guitarist, a violin player.
[00:06:50.249 - 00:06:55.136] Host: Because he had given so much work to the musicians because he was working in certain places and everybody used to adore him.
[00:06:56.017 - 00:06:59.422] Host: Even if they're not talented, you sit in the last row, take some money and go.
[00:06:59.442 - 00:07:01.705] Host: It would be good for your family, good for your education.
[00:07:02.567 - 00:07:08.195] Host: Even people like world-class players like El Subramaniam had kind words to say.
[00:07:08.655 - 00:07:10.117] Host: He shared with me like a couple of years back.
[00:07:10.818 - 00:07:16.146] Host: So even now, even today, that probably set the standard for me to where I should head.
[00:07:17.026 - 00:07:19.448] Host: as a human being, as a successor to him.
[00:07:20.469 - 00:07:23.412] Host: And now my nephew, G.V.
[00:07:23.452 - 00:07:24.293] Host: Prakash, is shining.
[00:07:24.573 - 00:07:26.195] Host: He's got one there national award twice.
[00:07:26.955 - 00:07:27.456] Host: He's a hero.
[00:07:28.677 - 00:07:30.579] Host: And my son, my daughters.
[00:07:31.720 - 00:07:31.940] Host: Yeah.
[00:07:32.741 - 00:07:33.822] Guest: And how did that change you?
[00:07:34.222 - 00:07:36.144] Guest: Like, my dad passed away recently last year.
[00:07:36.184 - 00:07:37.245] Guest: Oh, sorry.
[00:07:37.886 - 00:07:41.269] Guest: How does it affect you first and how does it change you later?
[00:07:42.810 - 00:07:46.834] Host: It affects you because that's the only thing you
[00:07:47.106 - 00:07:47.607] Host: you have, right?
[00:07:47.627 - 00:07:51.913] Host: Your parents, that's only holding ground for you.
[00:07:52.394 - 00:07:57.321] Host: The memories and what your dad is, what he represented or how he worked.
[00:07:58.663 - 00:08:04.492] Host: And so to everyone, your dad is your first hero, right?
[00:08:05.073 - 00:08:10.521] Host: Your mother is the angel who was a safe place to go.
[00:08:11.442 - 00:08:14.066] Host: The lap is the safe place to sleep.
[00:08:15.522 - 00:08:18.826] Host: That's why the respect for my mother or my father is still there, same thing.
[00:08:20.688 - 00:08:26.996] Guest: Did the position of your mother in your head change after your father's demise?
[00:08:27.016 - 00:08:29.299] Host: Yeah, my mother became like an entrepreneur.
[00:08:29.319 - 00:08:32.383] Host: She took the equipments and started renting it out.
[00:08:32.864 - 00:08:37.670] Host: Everybody suggested that she should sell all the stuff, put it in the bank, get the interest.
[00:08:37.690 - 00:08:39.232] Host: And she said, no, no, my son will play.
[00:08:40.253 - 00:08:41.635] Host: I'll keep my husband's stuff.
[00:08:41.655 - 00:08:42.476] Host: And then she expanded it.
[00:08:42.496 - 00:08:44.178] Host: She bought more keyboards for rental.
[00:08:44.482 - 00:08:48.266] Host: I used to rent it out for light music for studios.
[00:08:48.286 - 00:08:50.328] Host: So that was the income for like six, seven years.
[00:08:50.428 - 00:08:52.851] Host: And then that stopped, because everybody started buying the equipments.
[00:08:53.492 - 00:08:55.214] Host: That's when she said, now it's not going to happen.
[00:08:55.334 - 00:08:57.016] Host: You need to go and play.
[00:08:57.036 - 00:08:58.697] Host: The equipment rental has gone down.
[00:08:59.178 - 00:09:00.920] Host: And you started writing jingles?
[00:09:01.501 - 00:09:13.874] Host: No, I started playing keyboards for other composers like Telugu composers, Kanata composers, Mr. Eleh Raja, Tee Rajandar, M.S.Tree, Rajkoti, like multiple composers.
[00:09:14.114 - 00:09:15.356] Host: Every day, they're two songs.
[00:09:16.237 - 00:09:19.240] Host: Every day, they'll be like, I go at nine, I come back at 10.
[00:09:19.841 - 00:09:22.224] Host: And do they tell you what to play or do you have to come up with it?
[00:09:22.244 - 00:09:22.885] Host: Yeah, they have to.
[00:09:23.426 - 00:09:24.267] Host: They will tell you the notes.
[00:09:24.727 - 00:09:33.278] Host: But after a while, I think when I bought my computer systems, which is around 86, they gave me the freedom.
[00:09:33.318 - 00:09:35.141] Host: They'll just give me the melody and I say, you arrange it.
[00:09:36.082 - 00:09:37.423] Host: So I'd arrange all the stuff for them.
[00:09:37.664 - 00:09:39.466] Host: So that got used to arrangement.
[00:09:40.387 - 00:09:42.610] Host: But it was easier for me to arrange them.
[00:09:43.842 - 00:09:45.404] Host: They'll say, OK, just do a fight music.
[00:09:46.405 - 00:09:52.571] Host: So I'll have to create a fight music with rhythm and large 2T bangs and stuff like that.
[00:09:53.472 - 00:09:57.617] Guest: If you could pick one instrument and never play another again, which one would it be?
[00:10:01.341 - 00:10:02.502] Guest: Yeah, maybe.
[00:10:02.522 - 00:10:04.224] Unknown: Yeah.
[00:10:04.244 - 00:10:05.685] Guest: It's hard to travel with, right?
[00:10:06.767 - 00:10:06.987] Host: It is.
[00:10:08.268 - 00:10:09.530] Guest: Like a guitar you can just carry.
[00:10:09.970 - 00:10:13.133] Host: No, but keyboard is like you can have a smaller one.
[00:10:13.594 - 00:10:13.714] Unknown: Right.
[00:10:13.794 - 00:10:14.935] Host: the electronic one.
[00:10:16.217 - 00:10:20.861] Host: But having a piano, I could only afford after probably six, seven years of my learning.
[00:10:22.023 - 00:10:22.903] Host: Then I bought a Yamaha.
[00:10:24.265 - 00:10:27.148] Host: Then now I have Steinway and all this stuff.
[00:10:27.168 - 00:10:30.371] Guest: So for a few years, you've played with other composers.
[00:10:31.372 - 00:10:32.594] Guest: Almost 10 years.
[00:10:32.934 - 00:10:39.681] Guest: And then they started first telling you what you should play and then allowing you your own compositions or arrangement.
[00:10:40.322 - 00:10:40.722] Guest: And then
[00:10:41.314 - 00:10:45.119] Host: And then slowly went into Jingles, which everything is mine.
[00:10:47.062 - 00:10:48.344] Guest: But Jingles, you mean ads, right?
[00:10:48.925 - 00:10:49.085] Host: Yeah.
[00:10:49.886 - 00:10:50.807] Guest: Like in Tamil.
[00:10:51.689 - 00:10:56.315] Host: No, I think Jingles, because most of the agencies are international agencies, right?
[00:10:56.335 - 00:10:57.217] Host: O&M, HTA.
[00:10:58.819 - 00:11:02.444] Host: They would do the scratches here, and they will throw that out and do it in Mumbai.
[00:11:03.165 - 00:11:05.388] Host: And then after a time, I think they've started agreeing.
[00:11:05.729 - 00:11:07.932] Host: They started putting my stuff.
[00:11:07.952 - 00:11:09.554] Host: They initially do scratches.
[00:11:09.762 - 00:11:10.523] Host: What is a scratch?
[00:11:10.823 - 00:11:19.395] Host: Scratch is a tune where they just give it to the client to say if it's an ointment or a paint.
[00:11:20.236 - 00:11:21.457] Host: And they say, okay, this will work.
[00:11:21.918 - 00:11:24.882] Host: Now go to a bigger jingle composer and get this.
[00:11:26.304 - 00:11:30.710] Host: So then that became like, okay, now this itself is good enough and we can use it.
[00:11:30.770 - 00:11:31.531] Host: So that's the process.
[00:11:33.213 - 00:11:34.194] Guest: When did it all change?
[00:11:34.274 - 00:11:34.655] Guest: When was it?
[00:11:34.835 - 00:11:36.297] Host: 91.
[00:11:36.858 - 00:11:37.138] Guest: Yeah?
[00:11:39.042 - 00:11:42.066] Host: No, actually magic happened when I built my studio.
[00:11:42.086 - 00:11:44.028] Host: It was in 89, Panchatan studio which I have.
[00:11:45.149 - 00:11:46.411] Host: Is when I felt like empowered.
[00:11:46.891 - 00:11:48.193] Host: Like I had something which nobody had.
[00:11:48.834 - 00:11:49.214] Host: Which was?
[00:11:49.695 - 00:11:50.576] Host: Which my home studio.
[00:11:51.857 - 00:11:52.939] Host: Why did that change so much?
[00:11:52.979 - 00:11:55.121] Host: Many people probably had access to a studio, right?
[00:11:56.022 - 00:11:56.083] Unknown: No.
[00:11:56.103 - 00:12:01.048] Host: You know those days studios means like the big halls where 90 people can play together.
[00:12:02.210 - 00:12:03.892] Host: The concept of home studio never came.
[00:12:05.234 - 00:12:08.978] Host: So when I built my home studio is when I realized like nobody will judge me.
[00:12:09.538 - 00:12:10.920] Host: that I do good music or bad music.
[00:12:10.940 - 00:12:12.962] Host: I can judge it myself and play the final product.
[00:12:13.443 - 00:12:17.348] Host: Because in studios, whatever you play, 50 other people are watching you.
[00:12:18.169 - 00:12:21.193] Host: If you're bringing equipment, they're all coming, oh, what is it?
[00:12:21.313 - 00:12:22.014] Host: What is the new stuff?
[00:12:22.494 - 00:12:23.776] Host: How many people are going to lose jobs?
[00:12:24.977 - 00:12:27.180] Host: So I was the Gizmo guy, right?
[00:12:27.240 - 00:12:28.201] Host: I used to buy the computers.
[00:12:29.143 - 00:12:38.354] Guest: So if I want to become a musician in my life, or if people watching want to become a musician, what is that thing they have to do now like you
[00:12:38.562 - 00:12:40.946] Guest: got a studio, is there some equivalent for today?
[00:12:41.647 - 00:12:42.448] Guest: You just have to practice.
[00:12:42.468 - 00:12:43.770] Host: You just have an intention to learn.
[00:12:43.810 - 00:12:44.732] Host: You can learn anywhere now.
[00:12:45.573 - 00:12:46.615] Guest: What if I'm already learned?
[00:12:46.635 - 00:12:51.663] Guest: Like I'm not me because I have no knowledge, but somebody who is a learned train musician.
[00:12:51.683 - 00:12:56.550] Host: You come to Chennai, come to my conservatory called K Music Conservatory and join there.
[00:12:56.570 - 00:12:56.731] Guest: Right.
[00:12:57.412 - 00:12:59.715] Guest: And there you will teach me how to compose music.
[00:13:00.116 - 00:13:03.882] Host: Everything, any course like piano, voice and yeah.
[00:13:03.902 - 00:13:04.142] Host: Okay.
[00:13:04.163 - 00:13:06.386] Host: So you started a studio at home and then
[00:13:06.722 - 00:13:11.750] Host: And then I started experimenting my own music, which nobody had heard.
[00:13:12.211 - 00:13:13.653] Host: When Mani Ratnam came in, I played them all.
[00:13:14.835 - 00:13:17.419] Host: And he was quietly listening to all the stuff.
[00:13:17.439 - 00:13:20.424] Host: That listening session became the DNA for Roja.
[00:13:22.407 - 00:13:23.889] Guest: And then Roja changed everything.
[00:13:25.552 - 00:13:26.053] Guest: Immediately?
[00:13:26.694 - 00:13:27.816] Guest: Yeah, overnight.
[00:13:28.196 - 00:13:28.938] Guest: Yeah?
[00:13:28.958 - 00:13:29.659] Guest: What year was this?
[00:13:30.099 - 00:13:31.281] Guest: 91, I think, 91.
[00:13:31.562 - 00:13:31.762] Unknown: Right.
[00:13:33.474 - 00:13:39.260] Guest: So Roja released and next day people started treating you differently altogether.
[00:13:39.861 - 00:13:44.746] Host: Yeah, because he's one of the top directors which every actor, every composer wanted to work with him.
[00:13:45.487 - 00:13:46.769] Host: He's one of the top, not still.
[00:13:47.229 - 00:13:50.573] Host: I feel like everybody is drooling over to work with him.
[00:13:50.613 - 00:13:54.557] Host: Whether it's a success or even the process is so respectful.
[00:13:54.617 - 00:13:55.939] Host: The same is true for you.
[00:13:55.979 - 00:13:56.419] Guest: You know that.
[00:13:56.439 - 00:13:57.360] Guest: Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:57.380 - 00:13:59.383] Host: Oh, me.
[00:13:59.403 - 00:13:59.503] Unknown: Okay.
[00:13:59.523 - 00:13:59.763] Guest: Yeah.
[00:14:00.364 - 00:14:02.546] Guest: And then everything changed.
[00:14:02.626 - 00:14:04.568] Guest: people around you treated you changed.
[00:14:05.189 - 00:14:05.889] Guest: How did you change?
[00:14:06.690 - 00:14:07.411] Host: How did I change?
[00:14:07.451 - 00:14:09.052] Host: I was like, okay, this will be the last movie.
[00:14:09.653 - 00:14:10.173] Host: I don't want this.
[00:14:10.374 - 00:14:15.338] Host: I don't want movies because I've been in movies and it's so boring, but the money with the movies are completely different.
[00:14:16.319 - 00:14:20.023] Host: And he kind of listened to me like, this is what I want to do or I don't want to do movies.
[00:14:20.904 - 00:14:24.167] Host: Then I told him like, I said, I'm very satisfied working with you.
[00:14:24.207 - 00:14:25.328] Host: I don't want to work with other people.
[00:14:27.470 - 00:14:30.613] Host: He said, no, no, no, you should work with everyone.
[00:14:30.634 - 00:14:31.154] Host: So I said,
[00:14:31.298 - 00:14:35.382] Host: I'm very happy working just for you, and I'll do jingles or private albums.
[00:14:35.402 - 00:14:37.604] Host: I said, no, you should work with that one.
[00:14:37.624 - 00:14:42.449] Host: And so my first 10 years was like, okay, enough.
[00:14:42.469 - 00:14:44.270] Host: After this movie, I'll leave everything.
[00:14:44.891 - 00:14:45.692] Host: I'll do my own stuff.
[00:14:46.913 - 00:14:49.796] Host: Even movie was my own stuff, but I have something non-film.
[00:14:49.816 - 00:14:50.737] Host: Why do you think that was?
[00:14:51.177 - 00:14:51.677] Host: I don't know why.
[00:14:51.938 - 00:14:53.880] Host: I had this thing of leaving everything.
[00:14:54.540 - 00:14:57.663] Host: Is that because fear of disappointment?
[00:14:57.883 - 00:15:00.626] Host: No, no, I was resisting,
[00:15:02.210 - 00:15:08.317] Host: I'm resisting the way the movie industry was consuming, because my father was consumed, right?
[00:15:09.339 - 00:15:09.759] Host: In a good way.
[00:15:09.779 - 00:15:14.725] Host: After he passed away, only a couple of people were there, and nobody else showed up.
[00:15:14.745 - 00:15:17.308] Host: So that's when I was like, people have their own lives.
[00:15:17.569 - 00:15:19.291] Host: Then you realize they all have their own lives.
[00:15:19.591 - 00:15:21.473] Host: You were thinking this high will go away.
[00:15:21.754 - 00:15:22.254] Host: Not the high.
[00:15:22.435 - 00:15:24.337] Host: No, I said like, it is a thankless.
[00:15:24.998 - 00:15:27.601] Host: Any industry, it's not a community.
[00:15:28.382 - 00:15:31.826] Host: We just meet at the studios, very rarely do musicians meet, right?
[00:15:32.450 - 00:15:35.073] Host: So after he passed away, it is not a government job.
[00:15:35.093 - 00:15:37.076] Host: There's no pension, nothing, right?
[00:15:37.437 - 00:15:38.037] Host: Musician job.
[00:15:39.179 - 00:15:46.168] Host: I said, if they are like that, we also have to be careful in not giving every part of us to the industry.
[00:15:46.208 - 00:15:50.053] Host: We should have soul left with us so that I can do other things in art.
[00:15:51.315 - 00:15:52.877] Guest: Do you still feel that way about movies?
[00:15:53.598 - 00:15:59.986] Host: I always, I always, that's one of the reasons why when other composers were doing 30 movies a year, I felt I would,
[00:16:00.418 - 00:16:00.959] Host: do two.
[00:16:02.200 - 00:16:04.822] Host: I started with two and then three and then four, then became 12.
[00:16:05.523 - 00:16:09.167] Host: Then I escaped to resist people coming to me.
[00:16:10.068 - 00:16:14.332] Host: I went to England and sat with Henry Lloyd Webber doing Bombay Dreams.
[00:16:14.913 - 00:16:17.355] Host: The reason is to resist and grow.
[00:16:18.816 - 00:16:22.660] Host: Because I'm giving away all the stuff I learned, but I don't have anything new to offer.
[00:16:23.481 - 00:16:24.122] Host: I'll be thrown away.
[00:16:24.322 - 00:16:28.306] Host: So it's important to evolve artistically as a musician, composer.
[00:16:28.962 - 00:16:47.733] Host: is when I think the foundation of what I'm doing now is probably my time in London, my time in Hollywood, not doing music, studying, going for short courses, you know, unconnected with music, but to understand art and very differently.
[00:16:47.753 - 00:16:49.556] Guest: That's crazy that you're still learning to the day.
[00:16:50.598 - 00:16:52.501] Host: Learning in the way because you're forced to learn.
[00:16:52.521 - 00:16:55.666] Host: You buy a new rhythm machine, you have to learn how
[00:16:55.778 - 00:16:58.821] Host: where to project load, most of them are common.
[00:16:59.522 - 00:17:03.306] Host: But even there, many stuff is changing.
[00:17:03.526 - 00:17:07.651] Host: There's granular synthesis, there's algorithmic composition.
[00:17:07.671 - 00:17:20.024] Host: AI assisted editing, arrangements which all the masters have done like Bernstein and Gershwin and John Williams.
[00:17:21.165 - 00:17:25.490] Host: It's fascinating to see the older Tchaikovsky
[00:17:26.498 - 00:17:27.159] Host: modes are.
[00:17:27.699 - 00:17:29.582] Host: And there's always things to learn.
[00:17:30.343 - 00:17:43.458] Host: Not to copy, but to understand the, to speed up your orchestration and even studying songs about poetry, about metaphoricness, about not straight words, but where it's hitting you.
[00:17:45.000 - 00:17:50.927] Guest: Did you feel any imposter complex in this period where you thought you were undeserving of what you got?
[00:17:52.629 - 00:17:53.490] Host: That's why I surrender.
[00:17:54.370 - 00:18:00.980] Guest: Does this also translate into personal life where you might spend a lot less money than you can afford to?
[00:18:02.442 - 00:18:02.763] Guest: Like what?
[00:18:03.644 - 00:18:13.238] Guest: Like say, as a very wealthy man, you can afford to live X lifestyle, but you live 10% of that or 20% of that?
[00:18:13.799 - 00:18:15.882] Guest: My son is listening there.
[00:18:15.922 - 00:18:21.531] Host: Yeah, I think because it's not that I'm not...
[00:18:21.551 - 00:18:23.794] Host: I feel like if I can sustain...
[00:18:24.258 - 00:18:31.406] Host: My mother, God bless her, she used to give, on Friday, she used to give food.
[00:18:33.188 - 00:18:37.633] Host: So doing one thing, and for a certain number of people, she used to feed them.
[00:18:39.195 - 00:18:39.875] Host: We're still doing that.
[00:18:41.838 - 00:18:49.406] Host: She didn't feed on every day, and on a bad situation, you cut all the stuff.
[00:18:50.227 - 00:18:53.010] Host: We're able to do that with the grace of God even now.
[00:18:53.378 - 00:18:59.866] Host: that's consistently doing something good for a long time is better than doing everything at the one time and then not having money.
[00:19:00.367 - 00:19:02.109] Host: So I believe that consistency is very important.
[00:19:02.129 - 00:19:05.153] Host: Your lifestyle, even whether you have money or not, can be the same.
[00:19:07.255 - 00:19:13.924] Host: Because when I was doing Roja, I didn't have money for even putting petrol because I was just doing that one movie because I had to concentrate so much.
[00:19:14.945 - 00:19:19.310] Host: The days where I didn't have my petrol was, I used to drive that time, it was zero.
[00:19:21.073 - 00:19:22.194] Host: And I felt like,
[00:19:22.690 - 00:19:28.679] Host: It's a good feeling because you're sacrificing all that stuff for the believing in what you're doing, right?
[00:19:30.081 - 00:19:43.161] Host: So it's important that even my children realize like to be consistently in one lifestyle where you can travel, you can eat anywhere you want, but you don't want to show the whole world like what you are.
[00:19:44.484 - 00:19:48.289] Host: And then it's a fake pompousness, right?
[00:19:49.692 - 00:19:51.314] Host: And anyway,
[00:19:51.650 - 00:19:56.015] Host: In Chennai, I think it's a city which makes you be simple.
[00:19:57.777 - 00:20:02.462] Host: It's not unlike some other places where they don't hug you and see what you're wearing.
[00:20:02.922 - 00:20:15.415] Guest: I would ask myself when I like Delhi and Hyderabad are on one side and Bangalore and Chennai are on the other side of where projections sit.
[00:20:16.537 - 00:20:21.522] Guest: So I would think why is it appealing to Bangalore and Chennai
[00:20:22.434 - 00:20:33.268] Guest: to live under their means and why is the opposite the whole showing, living in the moment, more appealing to the...
[00:20:33.288 - 00:20:33.948] Host: Nothing wrong.
[00:20:34.349 - 00:20:38.955] Host: I think it's the way I think is consistency over years.
[00:20:39.956 - 00:20:45.843] Host: Rather than, you know, you can buy the best car, you can buy a Bugatti, you can be in the best flat.
[00:20:46.764 - 00:20:49.288] Host: But then, ultimately, where do you get the happiness in the studio?
[00:20:49.968 - 00:20:51.250] Host: So if you look at my studio, I have a
[00:20:51.970 - 00:20:54.213] Host: the most expensive piano, the most expensive mixer.
[00:20:55.094 - 00:20:57.938] Host: But that's, again, helping me to serve better.
[00:20:58.639 - 00:20:58.859] Host: Right?
[00:20:59.861 - 00:21:02.645] Host: So it's a little old school, but I believe it.
[00:21:03.806 - 00:21:10.916] Guest: When I thought about this, I was thinking about things like, okay, maybe North India saw so much war.
[00:21:10.976 - 00:21:12.538] Guest: So many people invaded.
[00:21:12.598 - 00:21:16.383] Guest: People did not live for as long.
[00:21:16.644 - 00:21:18.246] Guest: So they live more in the moment.
[00:21:18.987 - 00:21:21.330] Guest: People in the South have largely been
[00:21:21.634 - 00:21:23.696] Guest: Secure for a long period of time.
[00:21:23.996 - 00:21:25.398] Guest: Nobody's secure.
[00:21:25.418 - 00:21:26.118] Host: Relatively.
[00:21:26.359 - 00:21:27.820] Host: They have other tortures in life.
[00:21:29.842 - 00:21:31.484] Host: It is a double-edged sword.
[00:21:31.744 - 00:21:38.030] Host: When we go out, it's important to present India in the best possible way.
[00:21:39.612 - 00:21:42.054] Host: Because the whole world thinks India is in poverty and this and that.
[00:21:42.715 - 00:21:46.719] Host: I feel like India, the certain people are not in poverty.
[00:21:47.580 - 00:21:49.682] Host: We probably have the richest Indians here.
[00:21:49.954 - 00:21:55.783] Host: And it's important to express in the country with dignity to dress up to show that we are culture people.
[00:21:55.823 - 00:21:58.988] Host: We have a great history and culture and style and everything.
[00:21:59.248 - 00:22:00.090] Host: It's very, very important.
[00:22:00.470 - 00:22:01.853] Host: You don't want to show them that very simple.
[00:22:02.614 - 00:22:09.685] Host: Then when people are judging your, you know, as an Indian, I feel like I want to be in the best representative, the best car outside.
[00:22:09.705 - 00:22:13.070] Host: When I, I mean, I go in, I'm in LA, I have Bentley.
[00:22:14.292 - 00:22:15.013] Host: I lease a Bentley.
[00:22:15.414 - 00:22:18.258] Host: So, I mean, at least I had that type.
[00:22:18.370 - 00:22:20.252] Guest: Right.
[00:22:20.613 - 00:22:22.435] Guest: Why a Bentley fan?
[00:22:22.455 - 00:22:23.176] Host: Because it's easy.
[00:22:23.356 - 00:22:23.977] Host: It's cheaper.
[00:22:24.337 - 00:22:26.440] Host: You have to pay 110% duty here.
[00:22:26.540 - 00:22:27.101] Host: You just lease.
[00:22:27.661 - 00:22:27.781] Host: Right.
[00:22:27.801 - 00:22:29.023] Host: But is there a reason?
[00:22:29.043 - 00:22:30.505] Host: You can get any car.
[00:22:30.525 - 00:22:33.148] Host: As an artist, the style, aesthetic of Bentley appeals most.
[00:22:33.168 - 00:22:33.669] Host: Not like that.
[00:22:33.929 - 00:22:38.675] Host: Because I never believed in that because it was so cheap there to rent any car.
[00:22:39.195 - 00:22:42.619] Host: I said, I had that moment of two years, driving my kids around.
[00:22:43.160 - 00:22:44.001] Host: Hey, come, let's go.
[00:22:44.181 - 00:22:48.146] Host: And I have still videos of my son screaming when I'm going fast, sitting in the back.
[00:22:48.354 - 00:22:52.499] Guest: And you started driving when you were really early and still enjoyed driving?
[00:22:52.519 - 00:22:53.119] Guest: Do you still drive?
[00:22:53.139 - 00:22:53.460] Guest: I do drive.
[00:22:53.480 - 00:22:54.260] Guest: I started driving again.
[00:22:55.001 - 00:22:57.624] Host: I got my Mahindra electric car.
[00:22:58.825 - 00:23:01.969] Host: And there I have... Why Mahindra electric car?
[00:23:02.429 - 00:23:02.810] Host: I don't know.
[00:23:03.150 - 00:23:03.591] Host: I just love it.
[00:23:05.172 - 00:23:07.875] Host: For the first time I felt like it's world class quality.
[00:23:08.156 - 00:23:09.777] Host: And I also worked on it.
[00:23:09.797 - 00:23:12.721] Host: I was also constantly suggesting them to do this too.
[00:23:13.321 - 00:23:14.082] Host: The sound system.
[00:23:14.282 - 00:23:15.524] Host: And we had some of the best.
[00:23:16.124 - 00:23:17.586] Host: My music sounds the best in that.
[00:23:18.114 - 00:23:18.915] Host: Oh yeah.
[00:23:18.935 - 00:23:21.458] Host: So you were part of the design.
[00:23:21.578 - 00:23:24.722] Host: I'm not getting paid for this, okay guys.
[00:23:24.742 - 00:23:26.625] Host: So it was like a hobby project.
[00:23:27.446 - 00:23:28.868] Host: It was something very different.
[00:23:28.888 - 00:23:30.670] Host: I think Hans Zimmer had done for BMW.
[00:23:31.711 - 00:23:37.318] Host: And Mr. Velu, who was the CEO, he came in and we had fun.
[00:23:37.879 - 00:23:45.188] Guest: And beyond Roja and the initial success, what happened after that?
[00:23:45.669 - 00:23:46.450] Guest: Also for you,
[00:23:47.650 - 00:23:57.644] Guest: In some way, on the cusp of a change in trend of what kind of music was working in India in the 90s, did you catch a change in trend or did you create a change in trend?
[00:23:58.605 - 00:24:00.628] Guest: The trend happened because of Roja.
[00:24:00.648 - 00:24:00.848] Host: Right.
[00:24:00.989 - 00:24:01.529] Host: What was it?
[00:24:01.770 - 00:24:03.552] Host: There was a denial that, oh, this one last.
[00:24:03.572 - 00:24:05.315] Host: I think there was a denial constantly.
[00:24:05.395 - 00:24:07.978] Guest: What was the incumbent trend and what was the change in trend?
[00:24:09.160 - 00:24:11.363] Host: There was this traditional kind of music, which is beautiful.
[00:24:11.984 - 00:24:12.204] Host: Like?
[00:24:12.545 - 00:24:16.210] Host: The Hindi composers were all there and
[00:24:16.354 - 00:24:17.575] Host: There's a beauty in it still.
[00:24:18.917 - 00:24:20.158] Host: But because I'm not made of that.
[00:24:21.039 - 00:24:24.964] Host: My sensibility was different because I was in a band.
[00:24:25.665 - 00:24:32.453] Host: I like jazz, I like rock, I like, you know, kawali, I like karnataka, I like Hindustani.
[00:24:33.134 - 00:24:36.498] Host: So my aspiration was very expansive.
[00:24:37.379 - 00:24:38.320] Host: I didn't want to stick to that.
[00:24:38.380 - 00:24:43.666] Host: Dolac and mandolin kind of this thing, I wanted to
[00:24:44.930 - 00:24:45.731] Host: because I could do it.
[00:24:45.991 - 00:24:52.861] Host: Because I was now experienced in arranging for other people and also seeing the results and I had my own studio.
[00:24:53.842 - 00:24:59.811] Host: And I could get to the results faster than imagining it without people judging me.
[00:25:00.352 - 00:25:05.679] Guest: So you changed that trend into Roja kind of music and how would you articulate that?
[00:25:05.719 - 00:25:07.061] Guest: What was Roja kind of music?
[00:25:08.203 - 00:25:09.945] Host: Roja was very...
[00:25:09.965 - 00:25:13.490] Host: So my intention was, when I met Mani Ratnam Ji, I said,
[00:25:14.434 - 00:25:28.408] Host: When we are listening to Pink Floyd, Queen, John Williams, Vangelis, Beatles, Michael Jackson, they don't listen to us.
[00:25:29.389 - 00:25:30.049] Host: So what's the reason?
[00:25:30.750 - 00:25:39.779] Host: Language, production, and vibe, feel, recording, multiple things.
[00:25:40.800 - 00:25:42.221] Host: So I addressed all this stuff.
[00:25:42.281 - 00:25:43.282] Host: I was studying all this stuff.
[00:25:43.554 - 00:25:45.156] Host: I just told the stuff.
[00:25:45.176 - 00:25:54.751] Host: I said, Tamil song, which we do here should go and my, if you look at my internet, um, initial interviews, it says, uh, each Tamil song I do should go around the world.
[00:25:55.132 - 00:25:55.392] Host: Right.
[00:25:55.773 - 00:25:57.335] Host: And it was planned.
[00:25:57.836 - 00:25:58.577] Host: It was, I worked for it.
[00:25:58.617 - 00:25:59.919] Host: That's why I did less work.
[00:26:01.201 - 00:26:09.334] Host: And I had to, a lot of people thought, okay, this guy is like very adamant and, you know, snobbish.
[00:26:09.354 - 00:26:12.178] Host: Not my human limitations are,
[00:26:12.770 - 00:26:18.539] Host: I need time to heal, I need time to listen to it, I need time to change, I need to evolve a song into what present shape.
[00:26:18.559 - 00:26:25.670] Host: It's not like, I could do a song, three songs in seven hours, because I knew all the formulas.
[00:26:26.432 - 00:26:27.974] Host: That's not what I wanted to do.
[00:26:28.675 - 00:26:35.506] Host: I wanted to take it inch by inch to what I felt would be the future of my sound for the world.
[00:26:40.098 - 00:26:43.643] Guest: Indian classical music never had its day under the sun, per se.
[00:26:43.864 - 00:26:47.529] Guest: Like at some point, rock music was cool.
[00:26:47.569 - 00:26:49.592] Guest: At some point, jazz was cool.
[00:26:49.653 - 00:26:55.221] Guest: At some point, I'm saying across the world, in India, obviously, Bollywood is very, very popular.
[00:26:55.241 - 00:26:59.187] Host: We need to position classical music in a very higher way.
[00:26:59.207 - 00:27:02.532] Host: I think right now it's like, I give this much money, I can get a teacher now.
[00:27:03.834 - 00:27:06.418] Host: Getting a good teacher, getting the
[00:27:06.818 - 00:27:16.469] Host: They say hard to have transfer of knowledge, mind-to-mind transfer, no spirit, not just the knowledge of ragas but the spirit of giving from a guru.
[00:27:16.969 - 00:27:18.931] Host: It's only India sees that.
[00:27:18.951 - 00:27:21.494] Host: It comes in the saints and the Sufis.
[00:27:22.996 - 00:27:24.778] Host: It's not just knowledge.
[00:27:25.819 - 00:27:30.784] Host: It's giving the prayer and the soul actually wishes something in manifest.
[00:27:31.945 - 00:27:34.768] Host: The product has to be truthful.
[00:27:35.029 - 00:27:36.210] Host: The product has to be sincere.
[00:27:36.738 - 00:27:38.360] Host: When it's sincere, they grab it.
[00:27:39.921 - 00:27:45.867] Host: Because if you look at all the voice talent shows, they pick the best compositions, usually.
[00:27:46.668 - 00:27:49.651] Host: They pick because it's tough to sing and it shows the prowess of the singer.
[00:27:50.512 - 00:27:51.233] Host: That's very important.
[00:27:52.074 - 00:27:58.160] Host: So even that, even classical music, the way it's performed needs to change.
[00:27:58.300 - 00:27:59.301] Host: It needs to be more immersive.
[00:28:00.683 - 00:28:01.383] Host: And that's what we're doing.
[00:28:01.544 - 00:28:03.826] Host: I have a band called Jala, which
[00:28:03.970 - 00:28:09.956] Host: And we were also floating an award called the Bharat Mastro Award to find the next Zakir Rosayam, next Ravi Shankar.
[00:28:09.976 - 00:28:12.099] Host: Of course, not Anushka Shankar, he was there already.
[00:28:13.020 - 00:28:17.705] Host: For India, we need to find them and then nail them that these are the Mastros of India.
[00:28:18.746 - 00:28:21.429] Host: Like recently I did a song called Mutta Mare in Thug Life.
[00:28:22.230 - 00:28:23.251] Host: It's a very complicated song.
[00:28:23.771 - 00:28:24.632] Host: They embraced it so much.
[00:28:25.453 - 00:28:29.958] Host: Embraced it and it became a talk of, for three months they were talking about the song.
[00:28:31.379 - 00:28:33.842] Host: Because it has multiple ragas mixing and going in.
[00:28:34.690 - 00:28:40.617] Host: And if we put our energy in mastery in how we deliver the songs to people, definitely they'll like it.
[00:28:42.199 - 00:28:46.264] Host: It should not be the, you know, I'm giving you classical music, listen to it, it's good for you.
[00:28:46.284 - 00:28:52.311] Host: No, give something good and make it masterful with the whole team, like the dance and creativity and everything.
[00:28:52.972 - 00:28:54.094] Host: They will take it, definitely.
[00:28:54.454 - 00:28:56.657] Host: Hey Rama, it's a classical song.
[00:28:58.339 - 00:29:00.662] Host: The narrative, it's how you make them feel.
[00:29:01.082 - 00:29:02.003] Host: It's the most important thing.
[00:29:02.944 - 00:29:04.306] Host: Like this decor,
[00:29:04.802 - 00:29:06.024] Host: It feels very inviting.
[00:29:06.705 - 00:29:06.965] Unknown: Yeah.
[00:29:06.985 - 00:29:08.788] Host: It feels very...
[00:29:08.868 - 00:29:09.769] Host: It's welcoming.
[00:29:10.010 - 00:29:12.133] Host: It feels like somebody's...
[00:29:12.153 - 00:29:13.154] Host: It feels lived in, right?
[00:29:13.535 - 00:29:14.536] Host: Yeah, that's very important.
[00:29:14.697 - 00:29:15.077] Guest: Yeah.
[00:29:15.097 - 00:29:17.281] Guest: It's all from AIDS old.
[00:29:17.841 - 00:29:19.904] Guest: Like those pillars are temple pillars.
[00:29:20.646 - 00:29:23.550] Guest: That door is from a temple chariot.
[00:29:23.570 - 00:29:25.092] Guest: They're all from South Indian...
[00:29:25.913 - 00:29:29.058] Guest: I think you will also find it familiar because it's largely South Indian stuff.
[00:29:29.078 - 00:29:30.400] Host: Yeah, I love South Indian stuff.
[00:29:30.660 - 00:29:31.522] Host: Yeah.
[00:29:31.562 - 00:29:32.303] Host: Same with the Peace Garden.
[00:29:32.323 - 00:29:34.386] Host: If you come to Peace Garden, if you come to Chennai, I'll take you to...
[00:29:35.010 - 00:29:41.097] Host: which is a combination of South Indian temple architecture, Sufi architecture, makes up all this stuff.
[00:29:41.517 - 00:29:42.218] Guest: Yeah.
[00:29:42.238 - 00:29:45.602] Guest: But Indian art seems to be making a comeback.
[00:29:45.622 - 00:29:46.403] Host: Not enough, I think.
[00:29:46.983 - 00:29:47.684] Host: No?
[00:29:47.704 - 00:29:54.612] Host: I think art should be taught, artistic view should be taught to the kids from kindergarten.
[00:29:54.632 - 00:30:01.340] Host: The way they keep their houses, if every house in the street is kept well clean, the street is going to look beautiful.
[00:30:02.020 - 00:30:03.442] Host: When I went to Italy, that's what I found.
[00:30:04.226 - 00:30:22.647] Host: Or if you want to go to Jaipur or Kerala, they have a sense of style which and neatness and I'm not saying I've not been to many states but I feel like that's very important to inject that in the minds of younger people who will change the look of a country.
[00:30:23.248 - 00:30:25.851] Guest: Western cities are very homogenous.
[00:30:25.871 - 00:30:27.933] Guest: Like every building will have the same color.
[00:30:27.973 - 00:30:28.974] Host: That is US.
[00:30:30.136 - 00:30:32.338] Host: But if you go to places like
[00:30:33.730 - 00:30:39.779] Host: Even Italy, Greece is different, Spain is different, Morocco is different.
[00:30:39.799 - 00:30:40.561] Host: They all have a character.
[00:30:41.302 - 00:30:49.474] Guest: Don't you feel like Indian cities have every building which is so different and the colour is so different that it doesn't look cohesive?
[00:30:49.534 - 00:30:50.035] Host: No, it doesn't.
[00:30:50.316 - 00:30:51.357] Guest: Anyway, let's not talk about that.
[00:30:52.960 - 00:30:59.450] Host: But the important thing is to nurture children from kindergarten.
[00:31:00.011 - 00:31:02.194] Host: So they look at a country in a way where
[00:31:02.786 - 00:31:08.514] Host: there'll be the future people will change the way it looks better, like AI.
[00:31:09.936 - 00:31:12.759] Guest: I think creativity will become more relevant in the world of AI.
[00:31:13.240 - 00:31:13.681] Host: Absolutely.
[00:31:14.302 - 00:31:18.367] Host: Because I think you're empowering people with a vision who don't know the chops.
[00:31:19.428 - 00:31:20.530] Host: And the chops are actually AI.
[00:31:20.650 - 00:31:25.937] Host: So the vision and the prompts actually gives you options, which you see, oh, I like this.
[00:31:26.758 - 00:31:32.466] Host: And it's a very empowering tool for for younger people who don't have the access to
[00:31:33.698 - 00:31:39.164] Host: make a movie, or make art, or they don't know how to paint, but they have a vision.
[00:31:40.526 - 00:31:48.054] Host: At least it'll force them to have an example in part of what it's creating to beat that, right?
[00:31:49.556 - 00:31:52.259] Host: Which is an interesting thing now, I think, when you do music also.
[00:31:53.481 - 00:31:57.305] Host: You're constantly thinking, now the songs which are coming out are very experimental.
[00:31:57.625 - 00:32:01.810] Host: Like, recently there's a song by Ray, R.A.Y.
[00:32:02.146 - 00:32:04.810] Host: and it clearly shows that she's trying to beat AI.
[00:32:04.870 - 00:32:05.771] Unknown: How is that?
[00:32:07.153 - 00:32:14.383] Host: The way, the construction of the song is different from what people would do, which what AI copies, right?
[00:32:14.443 - 00:32:15.564] Host: It's learned from the past.
[00:32:15.985 - 00:32:20.331] Host: So you have to be contrarian to whatever the predictive model is.
[00:32:20.671 - 00:32:21.312] Host: Absolutely.
[00:32:21.813 - 00:32:23.094] Host: It forces us to think differently.
[00:32:23.655 - 00:32:24.516] Host: Okay, now we've got that.
[00:32:24.596 - 00:32:25.578] Host: Okay, how about this?
[00:32:26.839 - 00:32:31.666] Guest: But can't tomorrow another AI just play the role of contrarian?
[00:32:32.130 - 00:32:35.555] Host: evolutionary spirit and we will do something else.
[00:32:36.756 - 00:32:39.801] Host: We'll go back and do something which is completely wrong, which will be very cool.
[00:32:41.203 - 00:32:42.304] Host: Does music have rules?
[00:32:43.726 - 00:32:56.504] Host: Music, I feel, I go by nostalgia, I go by the good things of tradition and sometimes I got bored with that and I break the tradition.
[00:32:57.826 - 00:32:59.428] Host: So it's not one formula.
[00:32:59.789 - 00:33:00.690] Host: It's like how
[00:33:01.666 - 00:33:08.253] Host: How a narrator, so like when I'm talking to you, if I talk to anything boring, you won't look at me, I was like, he's already told this, I'm gonna look away.
[00:33:09.294 - 00:33:20.525] Host: But I'm looking at you, I'm constantly evolving, I'm saying like, let me tell you this stuff or let me tell you a new information which is not, no, then you were curious about it.
[00:33:21.306 - 00:33:29.554] Host: Music is like that, it's like a conversation where one is like, this tune is going like this and I need to surprise them with this one.
[00:33:30.146 - 00:33:35.654] Host: pull out the rhythm, or change the key, or change the rhythm, or change the raga.
[00:33:37.797 - 00:33:39.560] Host: Or come with the same lyric in a different way.
[00:33:40.741 - 00:33:41.943] Host: So it isn't experienced, right?
[00:33:43.405 - 00:33:44.307] Host: That's how I used to think.
[00:33:44.467 - 00:33:46.209] Host: I'm still thinking the same way.
[00:33:46.229 - 00:33:51.938] Guest: Do you think to be as successful as you have been, you need to catch a counter-trend?
[00:33:51.958 - 00:33:52.679] Guest: What is a counter-trend?
[00:33:54.321 - 00:33:57.586] Guest: Whenever the incumbent trend
[00:33:57.890 - 00:34:01.456] Guest: Like you said about old school music with Dholak and Mandolin and all of that.
[00:34:01.836 - 00:34:04.060] Guest: No, I love Dholaks.
[00:34:04.080 - 00:34:05.322] Host: But that's not the only thing.
[00:34:05.642 - 00:34:08.927] Host: Even now when I do a Kavali track, I use Dholak and Tabla.
[00:34:09.488 - 00:34:10.310] Host: I use strings.
[00:34:10.710 - 00:34:13.915] Guest: But to be able to recognize that people are tired of that.
[00:34:13.995 - 00:34:15.357] Guest: I am the people.
[00:34:17.481 - 00:34:18.943] Host: I need to see whether I like the song.
[00:34:19.684 - 00:34:22.008] Host: And if I feel good, this feels really good.
[00:34:22.028 - 00:34:22.929] Host: And they will love it.
[00:34:23.570 - 00:34:25.874] Host: Sometimes it takes time for them to get it.
[00:34:26.018 - 00:34:28.180] Host: And they get it and then it stays there forever.
[00:34:29.101 - 00:34:37.911] Guest: And for all the aspiring musicians and songwriters and composers watching this, what do you think the next change in trend will be that they can get on early?
[00:34:39.213 - 00:34:41.215] Host: I think all of them are so smart now.
[00:34:42.256 - 00:34:48.883] Host: And because the exposure, they get to see everything on re-use and social media.
[00:34:50.545 - 00:34:54.930] Host: Every person is a makeup person, an actor, a cinematographer, a director.
[00:34:55.618 - 00:34:58.921] Host: And it's fascinating to see how the younger people are evolving.
[00:34:59.001 - 00:35:05.467] Host: I discover so many people who are extraordinary in comedy, in direction, in effective reels.
[00:35:05.487 - 00:35:08.370] Host: It's just 30 seconds and they have to come up with stuff.
[00:35:09.431 - 00:35:12.494] Host: And it forces them to become great directors, storytellers.
[00:35:13.715 - 00:35:15.597] Host: And so I get inspired by them.
[00:35:17.399 - 00:35:18.740] Host: Yeah.
[00:35:18.760 - 00:35:20.061] Guest: But any suggestions?
[00:35:20.422 - 00:35:21.263] Host: Yeah, leaning into it.
[00:35:22.143 - 00:35:24.786] Host: Leaning into something, not giving up.
[00:35:25.122 - 00:35:25.663] Host: You shouldn't give up.
[00:35:25.683 - 00:35:28.247] Host: You should go back to music and lean into it.
[00:35:28.267 - 00:35:30.089] Host: I'll show you how bad I am at some point.
[00:35:30.149 - 00:35:31.712] Host: No, bad and good is subjective.
[00:35:31.752 - 00:35:32.353] Host: It's subjective.
[00:35:32.833 - 00:35:32.994] Host: Right.
[00:35:33.554 - 00:35:34.956] Host: One person is bad, the other person is good.
[00:35:35.738 - 00:35:37.921] Host: Like, you know good music when you listen to it.
[00:35:38.802 - 00:35:40.184] Guest: I'm good at listening to music.
[00:35:40.685 - 00:35:41.927] Host: That's a great start.
[00:35:42.247 - 00:35:43.409] Host: It's a great start.
[00:35:43.429 - 00:35:45.352] Host: That's how it is.
[00:35:45.372 - 00:35:52.402] Host: The lead would just don't give up and because, you know, you dig like the cliche is like first you get mud and then you get
[00:35:52.962 - 00:35:54.664] Host: water, then you get petrol, then you get gold.
[00:35:55.545 - 00:35:56.567] Host: So, but you have to keep digging.
[00:35:57.027 - 00:35:57.708] Guest: Right.
[00:35:57.728 - 00:36:00.732] Host: And the more you dig, you will forget yourself that you've become that.
[00:36:01.192 - 00:36:01.353] Guest: Right.
[00:36:02.013 - 00:36:02.694] Guest: How do I look?
[00:36:02.714 - 00:36:04.096] Guest: Okay, this is very personal.
[00:36:04.136 - 00:36:07.681] Guest: I don't know who this will help, but I can play a few chords.
[00:36:07.861 - 00:36:08.642] Guest: I don't sing well.
[00:36:08.702 - 00:36:11.225] Guest: Now I want to suddenly get better, not suddenly.
[00:36:11.686 - 00:36:12.627] Guest: In a year, get better.
[00:36:13.027 - 00:36:14.729] Guest: How do I do it?
[00:36:14.749 - 00:36:15.711] Guest: Just practice, practice.
[00:36:15.731 - 00:36:16.091] Guest: Yeah?
[00:36:16.111 - 00:36:16.331] Host: Yeah.
[00:36:17.273 - 00:36:18.955] Host: Don't wait for tomorrow to practice.
[00:36:19.115 - 00:36:19.636] Host: Practice now.
[00:36:20.076 - 00:36:21.618] Host: Once you go, after you eat,
[00:36:21.762 - 00:36:23.044] Host: Sit for five minutes.
[00:36:23.324 - 00:36:24.005] Host: Take your tampera.
[00:36:25.106 - 00:36:26.188] Host: Sing Saregama Padanesa.
[00:36:27.109 - 00:36:27.510] Host: Slowly.
[00:36:27.630 - 00:36:28.791] Host: I've heard it all my life.
[00:36:28.851 - 00:36:29.913] Host: I don't know why it flew.
[00:36:30.414 - 00:36:31.355] Host: I have to tell you a secret.
[00:36:32.957 - 00:36:35.781] Host: I'm singing from 92.
[00:36:37.163 - 00:36:39.125] Host: But then my singing was always to compose.
[00:36:39.626 - 00:36:39.786] Host: Right.
[00:36:40.367 - 00:36:41.729] Host: I'll play a chord and compose.
[00:36:42.329 - 00:36:45.534] Host: Then I realized that when I'm composing, I don't have to be in tune.
[00:36:46.415 - 00:36:47.717] Host: I just need to understand what tune.
[00:36:48.478 - 00:36:51.762] Host: When that becomes a habit, your singing becomes more
[00:36:53.282 - 00:37:00.992] Host: not that perfect because you're trying to reach notes and you're trying to like scribbling something, rather than painting, sketching something.
[00:37:02.073 - 00:37:07.740] Host: Then when I'm on the stage is when I realized like how to be in tune because people are recording, people are putting it on YouTube.
[00:37:08.582 - 00:37:15.270] Host: Then I started, my teacher said, Gulam Sokha Saap, who passed away.
[00:37:15.370 - 00:37:21.458] Host: So he said, practice your lower notes, like, go saani the
[00:37:21.570 - 00:37:24.714] Host: make it stronger, and your high notes will be as strong as that.
[00:37:25.214 - 00:37:29.019] Host: So, and now I'm learning a little bit from Ajay Da, Ajay Chakravati.
[00:37:29.680 - 00:37:32.463] Host: And his thing is like, go and go louder when you go down.
[00:37:33.544 - 00:37:37.049] Host: And that made a lot of difference in my pitch.
[00:37:37.069 - 00:37:40.733] Host: When I'm singing a note longer, I could feel that I'm in pitch.
[00:37:40.773 - 00:37:43.296] Host: And when I look at some of the reels, I'm like, yeah, okay, that's good.
[00:37:43.316 - 00:37:43.677] Host: That's good.
[00:37:43.697 - 00:37:46.020] Host: 20% improvement from what I was doing.
[00:37:46.881 - 00:37:47.081] Host: Right.
[00:37:47.441 - 00:37:50.465] Host: So there's no time, no age.
[00:37:51.006 - 00:37:51.346] Host: Right.
[00:37:51.458 - 00:37:54.021] Host: We are constantly evolving in every aspect of it.
[00:37:54.121 - 00:37:56.004] Host: Maybe I'll try and get a teacher.
[00:37:56.024 - 00:37:56.724] Host: That's a great idea.
[00:37:56.945 - 00:37:57.205] Guest: Right.
[00:37:57.365 - 00:37:58.707] Host: And Bombay is filled with teachers now.
[00:37:58.727 - 00:37:58.947] Guest: Yeah?
[00:37:59.127 - 00:37:59.288] Guest: Yeah.
[00:38:00.249 - 00:38:02.592] Guest: Do you think there's such a thing as talent in music?
[00:38:04.955 - 00:38:05.375] Host: There is.
[00:38:05.475 - 00:38:07.998] Host: Some people understand something better than other people.
[00:38:09.180 - 00:38:10.982] Host: Because it comes the way the mind works.
[00:38:11.703 - 00:38:13.305] Host: It doesn't mean that other people can't reach there.
[00:38:14.166 - 00:38:14.386] Host: Right?
[00:38:15.067 - 00:38:16.529] Guest: I have this theory about passion.
[00:38:17.169 - 00:38:17.450] Guest: Okay.
[00:38:17.990 - 00:38:20.914] Guest: I feel like all people are born the same.
[00:38:22.274 - 00:38:23.736] Guest: and we all attempt different things.
[00:38:25.478 - 00:38:36.153] Guest: If I was five years old and I played cricket, and I played cricket better than the 20 classmates of mine, I would organically become a passionate cricket.
[00:38:36.173 - 00:38:38.596] Guest: Because I'm doing it better than the 20 kids around me.
[00:38:39.398 - 00:38:40.780] Guest: Do you think the same is true for music?
[00:38:41.120 - 00:38:41.581] Host: No.
[00:38:41.621 - 00:38:44.945] Host: When I was young, I felt I was very bad at music.
[00:38:45.186 - 00:38:47.529] Host: I had stallers like Manuel Srinivas who was a genius.
[00:38:48.971 - 00:38:49.692] Host: He was younger than me.
[00:38:49.992 - 00:38:51.314] Host: He was playing Keetana.
[00:38:51.842 - 00:38:52.984] Host: I said, I'm not as good as that.
[00:38:53.004 - 00:38:55.307] Host: And I was seeing my teacher's son playing piano.
[00:38:55.687 - 00:38:56.428] Host: He was younger than me.
[00:38:57.970 - 00:38:59.993] Host: But I was forced to work anyway.
[00:39:00.013 - 00:39:05.401] Host: So my needed talent was less because I had to play some sound effect or some simple melodies.
[00:39:06.382 - 00:39:08.685] Host: And I met a teacher called Jacob John.
[00:39:09.066 - 00:39:09.987] Host: He was my father's friend.
[00:39:11.068 - 00:39:12.630] Host: He called me and said, you play very well.
[00:39:12.651 - 00:39:13.552] Host: I said, no, I don't play very well.
[00:39:14.473 - 00:39:16.155] Host: And he had this amazing technique.
[00:39:16.175 - 00:39:17.938] Host: He would wantonly play with mistakes.
[00:39:18.819 - 00:39:19.580] Host: And he would let you play.
[00:39:19.920 - 00:39:21.042] Host: I said, you're playing better than me.
[00:39:22.434 - 00:39:27.463] Host: So we had this incredible technique of trick to make you feel better.
[00:39:27.523 - 00:39:31.029] Host: And I hung out with them like three, four years.
[00:39:31.069 - 00:39:32.412] Host: It's one of some of the best times I had.
[00:39:32.452 - 00:39:36.459] Guest: I must also say you look incredibly young for your age.
[00:39:36.479 - 00:39:37.982] Guest: Like skin is glowing and all that.
[00:39:39.204 - 00:39:42.510] Host: My software is very, very latest, but hardware is becoming old.
[00:39:44.674 - 00:39:45.295] Host: Any secrets?
[00:39:46.056 - 00:39:47.058] Host: Secrets?
[00:39:47.394 - 00:39:48.976] Host: Just don't think negative stuff.
[00:39:48.996 - 00:39:49.997] Host: Don't worry about anything.
[00:39:50.037 - 00:39:50.857] Host: Nobody cares.
[00:39:50.958 - 00:39:54.661] Host: We all want to die one day.
[00:39:54.681 - 00:39:56.003] Guest: So all this happened, okay?
[00:39:56.023 - 00:39:56.163] Guest: Yeah.
[00:39:56.763 - 00:40:02.789] Guest: And then I have like notes about different years of your life and what happened.
[00:40:02.829 - 00:40:05.071] Guest: And I'm trying to like go into today.
[00:40:06.553 - 00:40:15.762] Guest: You did Andrew Lloyd Webber, Dil Seh happened, Vande Mataram, India at 50, Matu Jay Salam, all of that happened.
[00:40:16.994 - 00:40:17.775] Guest: We come to 2006.
[00:40:19.116 - 00:40:20.298] Guest: What's happening around this era?
[00:40:20.838 - 00:40:23.041] Guest: You started in 90s because of the studio.
[00:40:23.942 - 00:40:26.705] Guest: When you started a studio, you got this big break in Roja.
[00:40:26.745 - 00:40:28.747] Guest: Your life changed overnight.
[00:40:28.867 - 00:40:31.550] Guest: People around you started treating you like something else.
[00:40:32.331 - 00:40:40.400] Guest: You got a little imposter complex and insecure about putting all your eggs in one basket because you had seen it happen at home at an early age.
[00:40:41.061 - 00:40:41.882] Guest: You diversified.
[00:40:41.922 - 00:40:43.403] Guest: You continued to do many things.
[00:40:43.443 - 00:40:45.906] Guest: You went to Andrew Lloyd Weber's thing.
[00:40:46.050 - 00:40:47.873] Guest: things outside of India, in India.
[00:40:47.913 - 00:40:54.183] Guest: Tell us where your mind is at 2006, 2008, around this era, global slowdown era.
[00:40:55.024 - 00:40:59.411] Host: So 2006, I was appointed as the top TB ambassador by UN.
[00:41:00.873 - 00:41:07.563] Host: So I went, travelled to Singapore, met AIDS TB patients and a very completely different role.
[00:41:07.623 - 00:41:11.369] Host: I met Kofi Annan in the UN, all that stuff.
[00:41:11.509 - 00:41:14.514] Host: And then that's when my foundation, idea of foundation came by.
[00:41:14.850 - 00:41:17.293] Host: And by this time, you had a big deal, because you're meeting them.
[00:41:18.174 - 00:41:18.515] Host: I don't know.
[00:41:18.915 - 00:41:19.035] Host: 100%.
[00:41:19.055 - 00:41:20.678] Host: Yeah, I don't.
[00:41:21.559 - 00:41:22.620] Host: So I meet them.
[00:41:23.742 - 00:41:26.986] Host: I come back with a vision of like, why don't we have a school?
[00:41:27.446 - 00:41:34.776] Host: Like, you know, all these musicians are my father's age now and what if they pass and we don't have string players or trumpet players.
[00:41:35.637 - 00:41:39.602] Host: So the idea of starting the school came at 2008 where
[00:41:40.578 - 00:41:43.983] Host: I called one of my associates and said, hey, we have a Kusarala school.
[00:41:44.584 - 00:41:45.185] Host: It's a free school.
[00:41:45.205 - 00:41:46.367] Host: I'm gonna...
[00:41:46.387 - 00:41:47.509] Host: He said, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:47.529 - 00:41:48.710] Host: Free school, nobody's gonna respect.
[00:41:48.811 - 00:41:51.915] Host: You have to get money and I'll be the... And I'll take care of it.
[00:41:52.156 - 00:41:52.877] Host: So I didn't know anything.
[00:41:52.897 - 00:41:55.521] Host: So I called him and he took care of it.
[00:41:56.202 - 00:41:59.567] Host: And then there's so many conflicts, so many conflicts happening.
[00:42:00.208 - 00:42:02.812] Host: It evolved and then finally we bought a bigger place.
[00:42:03.533 - 00:42:07.780] Host: Mr. Ambani came and kindly inaugurated the place in 2013.
[00:42:07.820 - 00:42:09.362] Host: My mother was there.
[00:42:09.858 - 00:42:12.742] Host: And we started the KM Conservatory where it is now.
[00:42:14.444 - 00:42:18.689] Host: By then we had some of the young best piano players in the world, young and once.
[00:42:20.551 - 00:42:26.058] Host: And then it started evolving and then Oscars happened, all the stuff in 2008, 2009.
[00:42:28.040 - 00:42:29.442] Host: I was in a band with Mick Jagger.
[00:42:29.963 - 00:42:30.704] Guest: How big is that?
[00:42:30.784 - 00:42:35.890] Guest: Like, I've always heard of Oscars as being like this crazy ass thing that
[00:42:37.410 - 00:42:38.452] Guest: What is it actually?
[00:42:38.492 - 00:42:43.080] Host: I think when you see from outside, it's much more fascinating than being inside.
[00:42:43.981 - 00:42:46.425] Host: Inside, it's just, it's happening.
[00:42:46.445 - 00:42:46.766] Host: Yeah.
[00:42:47.107 - 00:42:52.596] Host: It's like, you know, once you get, once you pass one and everything's the same, same, same photographs are coming.
[00:42:52.636 - 00:42:54.880] Host: Hey, look here.
[00:42:55.260 - 00:42:56.122] Host: So that's interesting.
[00:42:56.162 - 00:43:00.850] Host: First, when I got the critics of what nobody called me, then, then was a golden globe.
[00:43:01.410 - 00:43:02.552] Host: Hey, that's you.
[00:43:02.672 - 00:43:03.793] Host: Come, let's take a photograph.
[00:43:04.074 - 00:43:04.855] Host: Three people call.
[00:43:04.875 - 00:43:06.017] Host: Then the next one is Oscar.
[00:43:06.577 - 00:43:08.100] Host: You know, 100 people calling your name.
[00:43:09.021 - 00:43:17.032] Host: So that I could see that whole evolution of how famous that movie and the music and you're all becoming.
[00:43:17.393 - 00:43:18.895] Guest: And how does it make you feel personally?
[00:43:18.935 - 00:43:29.490] Guest: Like now, I'm guessing wherever you are, like people are probably like surrounding you and asking you for this and that and pictures and... No, actually, I have a lot of private moments in the studio.
[00:43:29.954 - 00:43:30.855] Guest: No, when you're at home, yes.
[00:43:30.955 - 00:43:31.877] Host: But if you step out.
[00:43:32.157 - 00:43:33.098] Host: I step out very rarely.
[00:43:33.359 - 00:43:34.300] Host: But whenever you do.
[00:43:34.540 - 00:43:35.201] Host: I'm prepared for it.
[00:43:36.963 - 00:43:46.576] Host: When I'm very uncomfortable is when you take a long 16-hour flight and you're in transit, when people come in and they say, I'm tired.
[00:43:46.596 - 00:43:47.357] Host: No, no, no.
[00:43:47.377 - 00:43:47.978] Host: But we have to go.
[00:43:48.980 - 00:43:50.281] Host: Can you take a photograph?
[00:43:51.463 - 00:43:52.224] Host: Anyway, it's part of the game.
[00:43:52.805 - 00:43:53.866] Guest: Is there an on-off button?
[00:43:54.467 - 00:43:54.787] Guest: For what?
[00:43:55.228 - 00:43:59.794] Guest: For when some fan walks up to you and he's in your tired, you're in transit.
[00:44:00.450 - 00:44:01.471] Guest: Yeah, it is.
[00:44:02.112 - 00:44:02.752] Guest: But rarely.
[00:44:03.193 - 00:44:04.174] Host: It's not every day, so.
[00:44:04.694 - 00:44:05.375] Host: Now I have the mask.
[00:44:05.996 - 00:44:07.317] Guest: They recognize you with the mask?
[00:44:07.457 - 00:44:07.637] Guest: No.
[00:44:08.378 - 00:44:08.538] Host: No?
[00:44:08.678 - 00:44:09.139] Host: Not everyone.
[00:44:09.699 - 00:44:10.821] Host: Because I don't go with securities.
[00:44:10.841 - 00:44:11.661] Host: I just go walk alone.
[00:44:12.502 - 00:44:13.483] Guest: No security anywhere?
[00:44:14.785 - 00:44:15.285] Host: In Chennai?
[00:44:15.305 - 00:44:16.667] Host: No, only when I'm doing shows.
[00:44:17.207 - 00:44:17.387] Host: Right.
[00:44:17.888 - 00:44:20.591] Host: Because when you don't go with security, people don't take you seriously.
[00:44:21.572 - 00:44:23.694] Host: Only when a group of six people come home, somebody's in port.
[00:44:23.714 - 00:44:25.355] Host: Oh, that should be him.
[00:44:25.375 - 00:44:25.916] Host: So...
[00:44:25.936 - 00:44:27.858] Host: When you go to dinner in Chennai, for example.
[00:44:29.570 - 00:44:30.231] Host: You have to do it.
[00:44:30.291 - 00:44:31.493] Host: That is the irony of my life.
[00:44:32.154 - 00:44:32.534] Host: You can't.
[00:44:32.875 - 00:44:35.018] Host: That's actually took a toll on my family life.
[00:44:36.279 - 00:44:42.127] Host: When nobody allows you to eat, even in a marriage, when you go there, when you're eating, people say, can I take a photograph?
[00:44:42.147 - 00:44:42.768] Host: I said, I'm eating.
[00:44:43.129 - 00:44:43.870] Host: No, but we are going to go.
[00:44:44.531 - 00:44:44.971] Host: We have to go.
[00:44:46.513 - 00:44:47.895] Host: So they don't understand that a person is eating.
[00:44:47.915 - 00:44:48.516] Host: He's a human being.
[00:44:49.798 - 00:44:50.980] Host: He's not being bought by you.
[00:44:52.241 - 00:44:58.450] Host: But then you understand that how important you are in their life, and they don't want to miss the chance.
[00:44:59.458 - 00:45:00.479] Host: to take their perspective.
[00:45:01.480 - 00:45:02.801] Host: So I'd never eat in marriages.
[00:45:02.821 - 00:45:05.284] Host: I just go, wish them, I said, they won't allow.
[00:45:06.324 - 00:45:11.129] Host: Whenever I've worked with rock stars abroad, they just straight on the face and I don't do that, sorry.
[00:45:12.070 - 00:45:15.453] Host: Whether it's Hollywood actor or I've been with a couple of them and they're straight on the face.
[00:45:16.174 - 00:45:19.557] Host: That's why people don't come because most of them are like that.
[00:45:19.577 - 00:45:22.780] Host: They just snap and say, no, I don't do that straight away.
[00:45:23.681 - 00:45:24.662] Host: Indian actors are more kind.
[00:45:26.163 - 00:45:26.624] Guest: Why is that?
[00:45:27.825 - 00:45:29.106] Host: I think because we
[00:45:29.570 - 00:45:32.393] Host: Yeah, at a different race.
[00:45:32.413 - 00:45:33.614] Guest: We did a call with your sister.
[00:45:35.115 - 00:45:37.858] Guest: And she gave us some points.
[00:45:38.859 - 00:45:39.199] Guest: Which one?
[00:45:40.921 - 00:45:41.261] Guest: Rehana?
[00:45:41.942 - 00:45:42.722] Guest: Yeah, I think so.
[00:45:42.823 - 00:45:43.103] Guest: Okay.
[00:45:44.865 - 00:45:46.926] Guest: You didn't have many friends growing up, she said.
[00:45:47.467 - 00:45:49.749] Host: Yes, I had two friends actually.
[00:45:50.510 - 00:45:51.691] Host: One was an electronic geek.
[00:45:51.891 - 00:45:54.694] Host: We used to love making amplifiers.
[00:45:54.754 - 00:45:55.415] Host: Still met him.
[00:45:56.676 - 00:45:59.058] Host: The other one was also electronic geek.
[00:45:59.714 - 00:46:01.537] Host: I was fascinated with electronics when I was young.
[00:46:03.780 - 00:46:04.921] Guest: Is it the same even now?
[00:46:04.961 - 00:46:07.044] Guest: Is it tough to be friends for somebody in your position?
[00:46:07.665 - 00:46:08.266] Guest: There's no time.
[00:46:09.348 - 00:46:10.069] Guest: Outside of time?
[00:46:11.671 - 00:46:20.123] Host: Just even to spend time with family, I have to make sure that I now pull them on to a dinner or something, where not everybody is free.
[00:46:20.724 - 00:46:22.426] Host: They all have their own lives now.
[00:46:23.988 - 00:46:24.689] Host: Do you have friends?
[00:46:26.952 - 00:46:28.114] Host: All the directors are my friends.
[00:46:28.706 - 00:46:29.727] Host: Work people don't count.
[00:46:30.528 - 00:46:31.689] Host: I don't have a street like work.
[00:46:31.909 - 00:46:33.511] Host: I treat like...
[00:46:33.531 - 00:46:41.058] Guest: When I work with Anand Rai or Emthia or... People ask me this question and I say, who are your friends?
[00:46:41.118 - 00:46:43.040] Guest: I'll say lawyer, CA, all of that.
[00:46:43.060 - 00:46:43.660] Guest: It doesn't add up.
[00:46:44.321 - 00:46:45.162] Guest: It doesn't count.
[00:46:45.182 - 00:46:47.103] Host: Then I should have a life where I go to a club.
[00:46:48.084 - 00:46:50.347] Host: No, I go to a gym or something.
[00:46:50.807 - 00:46:51.247] Guest: Nothing?
[00:46:51.267 - 00:46:51.808] Guest: No hobbies?
[00:46:52.188 - 00:46:52.889] Guest: Sport?
[00:46:53.009 - 00:46:53.530] Guest: Gym?
[00:46:54.430 - 00:46:54.591] Guest: No.
[00:46:55.211 - 00:46:55.572] Guest: Nothing?
[00:46:55.892 - 00:46:57.233] Host: No.
[00:46:57.293 - 00:46:58.194] Host: I love what I'm doing.
[00:46:58.434 - 00:47:00.737] Host: I love, because it's not just music now.
[00:47:01.057 - 00:47:08.905] Host: Now it's metahumans and AI and this virtual reality and you know, I have younger people who are joining and doing amazing work.
[00:47:09.646 - 00:47:10.327] Host: So they are my friends.
[00:47:10.347 - 00:47:12.610] Host: I just eat with them, hang out with them.
[00:47:13.871 - 00:47:14.972] Host: Each team is different.
[00:47:16.614 - 00:47:17.555] Host: And yeah.
[00:47:18.176 - 00:47:19.717] Host: And I sometimes DM people.
[00:47:20.798 - 00:47:27.666] Host: If there's a good person with a farm, interesting plantation thing, I DM them say, I would like to meet you.
[00:47:28.450 - 00:47:30.372] Host: Then, you know, it's like random people.
[00:47:30.392 - 00:47:31.473] Host: It's not just music.
[00:47:32.214 - 00:47:35.678] Host: It is illustrators and cosplay artists sometimes.
[00:47:36.359 - 00:47:39.683] Guest: Anyone incredibly have run across like this by DMing them?
[00:47:40.584 - 00:47:42.106] Guest: By DM, I'm assuming social media.
[00:47:42.686 - 00:47:45.670] Host: The most biggest surprise I got was Spike Lee DMing me.
[00:47:46.050 - 00:47:47.472] Host: Hey, sir, how are you?
[00:47:47.492 - 00:47:47.812] Host: Really?
[00:47:47.952 - 00:47:48.953] Host: Yeah, I was doing COVID.
[00:47:48.973 - 00:47:49.794] Host: DM on what platform?
[00:47:50.175 - 00:47:51.176] Host: On Instagram.
[00:47:51.196 - 00:47:52.037] Guest: You're active like that.
[00:47:52.077 - 00:47:52.878] Guest: You use it yourself?
[00:47:53.158 - 00:47:53.338] Guest: Yeah.
[00:47:53.719 - 00:47:54.420] Host: Yeah.
[00:47:54.560 - 00:47:55.321] Guest: Can I message you on?
[00:47:55.601 - 00:47:55.941] Guest: Of course.
[00:47:56.282 - 00:47:56.562] Guest: Yeah.
[00:47:58.018 - 00:47:59.079] Host: But I don't pick everything.
[00:47:59.380 - 00:48:01.202] Host: I see sometimes you feel...
[00:48:01.222 - 00:48:03.285] Guest: I see some blue... Oh, blue take.
[00:48:03.465 - 00:48:05.809] Guest: What would be interesting for me to send you on Instagram?
[00:48:05.829 - 00:48:07.951] Guest: That will make you be like, thanks Nikhil for sending me.
[00:48:07.971 - 00:48:12.137] Host: I have this investor who's got $1 billion to invest in your company.
[00:48:12.157 - 00:48:14.160] Host: I'll be... immediately I'll answer.
[00:48:14.520 - 00:48:14.661] Guest: Yeah.
[00:48:14.981 - 00:48:18.225] Guest: And then it makes... You went to the US and met a bunch of AI people, right?
[00:48:18.446 - 00:48:18.826] Host: Yeah.
[00:48:18.866 - 00:48:19.968] Guest: Some of them are my friends.
[00:48:20.268 - 00:48:20.609] Host: Okay.
[00:48:20.629 - 00:48:21.350] Guest: And they mentioned it.
[00:48:21.390 - 00:48:22.651] Guest: You went to Perplexity.
[00:48:22.752 - 00:48:25.495] Guest: You went to... Who was the most interesting of them all?
[00:48:26.196 - 00:48:27.538] Host: No, actually it's very, very brief.
[00:48:29.122 - 00:48:32.025] Host: Sri Ram and Arti came to my house and we hung out there.
[00:48:32.626 - 00:48:37.511] Host: And I met Sri Nivas in Public City.
[00:48:37.551 - 00:48:38.873] Host: Where do you make of him?
[00:48:38.893 - 00:48:40.454] Host: He's also from Chennai.
[00:48:41.055 - 00:48:41.916] Host: Where do you make of him?
[00:48:42.056 - 00:48:42.637] Host: Yeah, he's very good.
[00:48:42.697 - 00:48:44.599] Host: My son's friend, more than me.
[00:48:44.619 - 00:48:45.059] Guest: Yeah?
[00:48:45.079 - 00:48:45.820] Host: Yeah, they hang out.
[00:48:47.242 - 00:48:48.243] Host: And Sam Altman.
[00:48:49.064 - 00:48:49.885] Guest: Where do you make of Sam?
[00:48:51.126 - 00:48:55.871] Host: Sam, strangely, I was the only person I followed on Twitter for a while.
[00:48:57.333 - 00:48:58.354] Host: And Chajabiri came in.
[00:48:58.786 - 00:49:02.171] Host: And he was like, he was looking at the secret mountain.
[00:49:02.191 - 00:49:03.573] Host: He was fascinated.
[00:49:03.593 - 00:49:08.980] Host: I think that whatever help you guys need in technology, right?
[00:49:10.142 - 00:49:23.320] Host: But I think there's not just secret mountains about fashion, merchandise, music, wisdom, entertainment, quite a lot of big package and pretty exhausting if we don't have a big team.
[00:49:23.400 - 00:49:27.666] Host: So that's, that's one of the reasons why we are like waiting to
[00:49:27.810 - 00:49:31.916] Host: for the big leap to just preparing all the groundwork on that one.
[00:49:33.178 - 00:49:40.610] Guest: When you hang out with those AI guys, I've ended up spending a reasonable amount of time with all of them.
[00:49:41.090 - 00:49:42.012] Guest: In fact, I have to go.
[00:49:42.292 - 00:49:51.146] Host: My first comment with any AI person is don't make people lose jobs.
[00:49:53.569 - 00:49:56.594] Host: Empower people
[00:49:57.922 - 00:50:09.177] Host: to remove the curses of generational curses, which comes to like poverty, misinformation, and lack of tools to create stuff, to telling stories, right?
[00:50:09.197 - 00:50:13.603] Host: I think this is the... From the beginning, I was like a broken record just saying this.
[00:50:13.623 - 00:50:14.184] Host: Because you do...
[00:50:14.204 - 00:50:16.126] Host: But how is that possible?
[00:50:16.146 - 00:50:16.907] Host: That's...
[00:50:16.927 - 00:50:18.970] Host: If you buy a gun, you've set rules, right?
[00:50:19.591 - 00:50:20.432] Host: You don't give it to everyone.
[00:50:20.993 - 00:50:21.974] Host: Because they want to shoot everybody.
[00:50:22.114 - 00:50:22.835] Host: They want to kill people.
[00:50:23.576 - 00:50:24.758] Host: It's not free to use.
[00:50:25.138 - 00:50:25.979] Host: It has restrictions.
[00:50:26.801 - 00:50:27.922] Host: Now you're not shooting people.
[00:50:28.034 - 00:50:30.818] Host: But you can pull the carpet off, make them jobless.
[00:50:31.378 - 00:50:34.182] Host: It's like making families going into poverty.
[00:50:35.403 - 00:50:37.065] Host: So it is the rules.
[00:50:37.146 - 00:50:38.227] Host: Humans have to set the rules.
[00:50:39.248 - 00:50:40.089] Host: You have traffic rules.
[00:50:41.191 - 00:50:42.152] Host: You have immigration rules.
[00:50:43.093 - 00:50:43.714] Host: You have custom rules.
[00:50:43.734 - 00:50:50.483] Guest: While it might kill jobs in the short term, one can argue that productivity in a society will go up in the long term.
[00:50:50.503 - 00:50:56.370] Host: We have to shape it up and say, you can't give a tool which is very, very destructive in
[00:50:57.346 - 00:50:59.348] Host: making a family going to debt.
[00:51:00.790 - 00:51:09.160] Host: If somebody just learned something and now everything can be done with AI, he's going to be helpless because he's learned that in college for four years.
[00:51:09.200 - 00:51:12.645] Host: He spent all his life learning something and AI can do it in two seconds.
[00:51:14.447 - 00:51:17.511] Host: So we need to find the alternate way before you jump and give those tools to people.
[00:51:18.692 - 00:51:19.473] Host: Be tough though.
[00:51:19.493 - 00:51:26.802] Host: No, because Australia now has said like no person can learn, use their data to learn.
[00:51:26.914 - 00:51:29.137] Host: stuff so that to create their identity.
[00:51:29.918 - 00:51:33.061] Guest: But the new AIs are learning of synthetic data.
[00:51:33.181 - 00:51:38.407] Host: Let it do stuff which humans cannot rather than doing things which humans can do better.
[00:51:38.688 - 00:51:43.834] Host: So that's why I think art plays a very big tool.
[00:51:43.854 - 00:51:54.226] Host: Like you need to make musical theatre, symphonies and all the stuff which can entertain people and they can be a part of that larger system, economic system.
[00:51:55.170 - 00:52:04.022] Guest: The problem with regulation around AI, in my opinion, is the incumbents will use it to not allow new people to come into AI.
[00:52:06.245 - 00:52:14.977] Guest: If there is a young kid in Bangalore trying to build an AI wrapper, albeit, by virtue of regulation, he will be regulated out of the market.
[00:52:14.997 - 00:52:16.018] Host: No, not that kind of regulation.
[00:52:16.058 - 00:52:17.240] Host: Not in entertainment.
[00:52:17.260 - 00:52:24.690] Host: I'm saying in finding a way that all the people running things, the entrepreneurs or the chief,
[00:52:25.442 - 00:52:30.269] Host: they should be careful in finding, because history is going to talk about them in future.
[00:52:30.969 - 00:52:35.676] Host: Like how they made something which is a monster as a blessing.
[00:52:36.257 - 00:52:37.098] Host: It could become a monster.
[00:52:37.518 - 00:52:39.281] Host: It's a blessing under Curse.
[00:52:39.301 - 00:52:40.683] Guest: I'm actually going back to the US.
[00:52:40.803 - 00:52:42.165] Guest: I've been there a lot this year.
[00:52:42.205 - 00:52:50.957] Guest: I've been like working, interning with these AI companies, trying to learn what is coming up next, what can be done.
[00:52:51.317 - 00:52:52.419] Guest: I'm going back on Friday.
[00:52:52.439 - 00:52:54.962] Host: The reason the Sacred Mountain is also set a pattern
[00:52:55.106 - 00:52:59.531] Host: where we use the best of AI and we use the best of humans.
[00:53:00.753 - 00:53:11.486] Host: And there'll be so many jobs, so much of human contribution to something like this, so that it becomes an industry by itself.
[00:53:11.506 - 00:53:11.746] Host: Right.
[00:53:13.768 - 00:53:18.194] Host: AI and music will hurt musicians, right?
[00:53:19.035 - 00:53:25.042] Host: It'll hurt, but then can AI go and sing with a guitar in a house or in a concert, or can it
[00:53:25.634 - 00:53:32.521] Host: teach in the human way which a teacher has been teaching with the spirit, passing on the spirit of music to a student.
[00:53:32.541 - 00:53:39.047] Host: There are so many things which comes, human experience is the best word I would say, which it can't do.
[00:53:39.628 - 00:53:42.350] Host: Anything on TV could be generated now.
[00:53:42.971 - 00:53:52.841] Host: So I think that that's why live concerts, live dance, live musical theatre, symphonies will be respected even more.
[00:53:52.981 - 00:53:54.322] Host: The value of that is going to go
[00:53:54.722 - 00:53:59.950] Guest: So in a way, you're saying build more live experiences, businesses for young people who want to start a business.
[00:54:00.811 - 00:54:05.718] Host: Because we're all now locked in something called the flats, imprisoned in those little boxes.
[00:54:05.858 - 00:54:06.680] Host: We can't even get out.
[00:54:07.541 - 00:54:16.694] Host: So live actually goes back to that community feeling where you enjoy something with the other person, share the experience, the joy.
[00:54:16.734 - 00:54:24.626] Host: And that is also being reinvented now, live experiences now, the way visuals and
[00:54:24.866 - 00:54:33.357] Host: everything is time-consuming with augmented musical gadgets, visual gadgets.
[00:54:33.377 - 00:54:36.562] Host: So the experience is not as like how we watched 10 years back.
[00:54:36.622 - 00:54:37.523] Host: It's much more better now.
[00:54:38.644 - 00:54:47.496] Guest: When you work with people and you try and figure out what music should be put out, I'm guessing very often you know so much more about music than these people.
[00:54:47.516 - 00:54:48.017] Guest: I don't know anything.
[00:54:49.799 - 00:54:51.762] Guest: I go like blank slate because
[00:54:52.130 - 00:54:57.736] Guest: Like if a movie producer tells you, for example, say in Hollywood, that this is not working, can we change it?
[00:54:57.796 - 00:54:58.697] Guest: What do you do?
[00:54:58.717 - 00:55:00.039] Guest: Always change it.
[00:55:01.300 - 00:55:02.641] Host: I don't go with one idea.
[00:55:02.661 - 00:55:06.445] Host: I go with sometimes four ideas, five ideas.
[00:55:07.447 - 00:55:09.429] Host: Then I throw out two of them.
[00:55:10.029 - 00:55:11.191] Host: So I keep sometimes three.
[00:55:11.651 - 00:55:12.112] Host: I play them.
[00:55:13.413 - 00:55:18.098] Host: And sometimes you have an instinct to say, who's going to work, right?
[00:55:18.786 - 00:55:22.190] Host: I put that in somewhere, I think they will connect to something, but it's nice, but can you do this?
[00:55:22.390 - 00:55:23.211] Host: Yeah, I'll add that.
[00:55:23.571 - 00:55:26.695] Host: It's not a ready-made product, which is given.
[00:55:27.155 - 00:55:27.836] Host: That will never work.
[00:55:27.856 - 00:55:29.718] Host: Somebody calls up, I do a song and send it to me.
[00:55:30.099 - 00:55:33.943] Host: There are specifics about story, characterization, why, which they like.
[00:55:35.705 - 00:55:42.433] Guest: I was reading this book about Michelangelo, like artist extraordinaire, all time, whatever.
[00:55:43.274 - 00:55:47.218] Guest: And he was like once while he was sculpting David,
[00:55:47.554 - 00:55:50.157] Guest: A politician came to him and said, the nose is too big.
[00:55:51.118 - 00:55:55.863] Guest: So, what he did next is he just, he was on a scaffolding.
[00:55:55.923 - 00:56:01.089] Guest: He threw some dust down and he said he changed the nose, but actually he didn't do anything.
[00:56:01.109 - 00:56:01.489] Host: Exactly.
[00:56:02.810 - 00:56:03.431] Guest: A lot of that?
[00:56:04.012 - 00:56:04.372] Host: Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:04.833 - 00:56:05.273] Host: It happens.
[00:56:05.754 - 00:56:07.135] Host: See, now it's correct and you don't know anything.
[00:56:08.857 - 00:56:09.598] Host: It's just that ego.
[00:56:10.258 - 00:56:11.440] Host: See, I made it better.
[00:56:11.920 - 00:56:13.682] Host: Sometimes.
[00:56:17.090 - 00:56:23.799] Guest: I was in Delhi a couple of days ago and I was at a friend's house and I tried the new Meta glasses.
[00:56:24.140 - 00:56:24.540] Host: Okay.
[00:56:24.560 - 00:56:24.921] Guest: It's common.
[00:56:25.161 - 00:56:25.602] Guest: It's common.
[00:56:25.622 - 00:56:25.862] Guest: Yeah.
[00:56:25.882 - 00:56:32.071] Guest: Which have a, so on the right side, they have a display and you have to wear a band.
[00:56:32.211 - 00:56:32.351] Guest: Yeah.
[00:56:33.032 - 00:56:35.856] Guest: And then you click like this and you scroll like this.
[00:56:36.697 - 00:56:42.405] Guest: For the first time, it's starting to feel like it could be the form factor.
[00:56:43.146 - 00:56:43.346] Guest: Yeah.
[00:56:43.906 - 00:56:47.490] Guest: Do you have a bet on what could be the form factor of tomorrow?
[00:56:48.151 - 00:56:49.513] Guest: How you interact with AI?
[00:56:51.475 - 00:56:56.021] Host: So I started researching on virtual reality around from 2015.
[00:56:56.041 - 00:57:00.967] Host: So I directed my first VR movie in 2016.
[00:57:02.289 - 00:57:07.495] Host: And I was fascinated because it's so real, it's so immersive.
[00:57:07.515 - 00:57:09.658] Host: And it helps you to go to places which you've never been.
[00:57:09.918 - 00:57:13.042] Host: Like the spaces, you can see spaces which
[00:57:13.986 - 00:57:24.536] Host: Antarctica, you know, the Vatican, and the Kaaba, and the temple where people, it's so real, right?
[00:57:25.037 - 00:57:29.401] Host: And I could probably look at one image for more than five minutes.
[00:57:29.561 - 00:57:31.624] Host: There's so many details, so much detail in it.
[00:57:32.845 - 00:57:37.950] Host: So it fascinated and then I said, why don't we do, I had a story and I said, why can't we do a movie in this?
[00:57:38.490 - 00:57:39.692] Host: This is the path nobody's taking.
[00:57:39.972 - 00:57:42.194] Host: It was a very difficult path, a lone ranger.
[00:57:43.010 - 00:57:43.911] Host: taking it and working.
[00:57:44.372 - 00:57:45.834] Host: So I did Lemask now.
[00:57:46.535 - 00:57:48.718] Host: It's been almost nine years since I directed that one.
[00:57:49.579 - 00:57:53.083] Host: It's playing in Singapore and it's playing in Vancouver dome.
[00:57:53.804 - 00:57:55.246] Host: And you have to wear the VR glasses.
[00:57:55.326 - 00:57:57.069] Host: In Vancouver, no, it's projected in the dome.
[00:57:57.469 - 00:58:00.093] Host: It's been translated to dome then.
[00:58:01.194 - 00:58:04.519] Guest: So my primary job is of a stock investor.
[00:58:05.240 - 00:58:09.906] Guest: So I used to follow Meta now, Facebook then, stock for
[00:58:10.306 - 00:58:14.370] Guest: the duration that they attempted to put a lot of money behind the metaverse.
[00:58:15.071 - 00:58:20.097] Guest: They would spend something like $8-9 billion a year if I'm not wrong about the number.
[00:58:20.137 - 00:58:22.940] Guest: And eventually, they ditched it.
[00:58:23.420 - 00:58:27.665] Guest: So, they didn't ditch it or they stopped the amount of money that was being spent on it.
[00:58:27.685 - 00:58:34.553] Host: I think what happened was for making VR movies, you need to unlearn many things for content.
[00:58:35.233 - 00:58:39.538] Host: So, film people come and use their techniques to do virtual reality.
[00:58:40.258 - 00:58:42.641] Host: it makes people throw up.
[00:58:42.661 - 00:58:50.030] Host: So because I didn't have any experience in film, I could take the path of what I felt will be right for me.
[00:58:51.171 - 00:58:57.198] Host: So like moving the camera would be like all nausea and the frame rate, global chatter.
[00:58:58.640 - 00:59:10.194] Host: And what kind of experience would be great for a person who's a, it shouldn't be a replacement for cinema, but an alternate coexisting, right?
[00:59:10.722 - 00:59:13.406] Host: So what you don't get in cinema, you'll get on this one.
[00:59:13.426 - 00:59:20.655] Host: In cinema, you get the kind of community feel, like you all whistle on the same thing, you all, or stack and look at the other person, oh, that's a great scene.
[00:59:20.795 - 00:59:23.059] Host: You know, that you can't do when we are, it's very personal.
[00:59:23.079 - 00:59:24.581] Host: You can't look at your Facebook, Twitter and...
[00:59:25.061 - 00:59:28.606] Guest: But you can have other people who are also when we are watching something with you.
[00:59:28.626 - 00:59:33.392] Host: No, but this, like when you come to Chennai, I'll play you my experience.
[00:59:33.412 - 00:59:34.193] Host: It's installed there.
[00:59:34.354 - 00:59:37.498] Host: You'll understand what I'm talking about.
[00:59:37.518 - 00:59:37.618] Unknown: Yeah.
[00:59:38.050 - 00:59:39.132] Guest: So I have no agenda today.
[00:59:39.252 - 00:59:40.574] Guest: I don't want to speak about anything.
[00:59:40.694 - 00:59:42.557] Guest: I want to speak about what you want to speak about.
[00:59:43.558 - 00:59:45.020] Guest: Let me speak about the Meta band.
[00:59:45.782 - 00:59:53.894] Host: Again, this idea came from when I was hanging out in LA, after the Oscars, Grammys and all this stuff.
[00:59:53.914 - 00:59:56.458] Host: I said, why are Indians not creating something for the West?
[00:59:57.599 - 00:59:59.402] Host: Or not the West, for the whole world, right?
[00:59:59.823 - 01:00:07.314] Host: Because we've seen great bands coming from Sweden, America, England,
[01:00:07.522 - 01:00:08.143] Host: Africa.
[01:00:09.264 - 01:00:14.891] Host: But the only Indian was famous like Ravi Shankar, Zakir Huzain, Al Shankar, Subramaniam.
[01:00:15.852 - 01:00:20.498] Host: But then why can't young India create something like that?
[01:00:21.859 - 01:00:22.821] Host: Because we need to be ahead.
[01:00:22.841 - 01:00:24.803] Host: We can't go back to what they did.
[01:00:25.183 - 01:00:29.188] Host: But we need to find a space which India, what India wants to say to the world.
[01:00:30.009 - 01:00:31.551] Host: So that's where Secret Mountain was created.
[01:00:32.693 - 01:00:37.138] Host: And not just to sing Hindi songs or Tamil songs.
[01:00:37.378 - 01:00:41.023] Host: but being a voice from India to the world.
[01:00:41.924 - 01:00:44.968] Host: Not like Indian voice, but international voice, right?
[01:00:45.890 - 01:00:47.552] Host: So we've been working on it for three years.
[01:00:47.812 - 01:00:48.914] Guest: Can you simplify it for me?
[01:00:48.994 - 01:00:52.759] Guest: Like, I watched a bunch of videos of you talking about it.
[01:00:53.039 - 01:00:53.260] Host: Yeah.
[01:00:53.821 - 01:01:00.690] Guest: I saw the characters who are the band members, the blonde guy, the Punjabi guy, all of them.
[01:01:01.491 - 01:01:06.578] Guest: And they all said that my proficiency is in A and B. Yeah.
[01:01:06.786 - 01:01:07.487] Guest: and we are a band.
[01:01:08.328 - 01:01:11.192] Guest: But what does that mean really?
[01:01:11.373 - 01:01:19.384] Host: It talks about each community, where they're coming from, like Africa, North India, South India, Ireland.
[01:01:19.564 - 01:01:21.086] Host: She was the prettiest, the African.
[01:01:21.106 - 01:01:21.507] Host: Yes.
[01:01:21.887 - 01:01:23.830] Host: We made sure that we gave it full respect.
[01:01:24.932 - 01:01:30.620] Host: Especially Africa, Ireland, India, China, they have millions of stories to tell.
[01:01:31.421 - 01:01:32.683] Host: But there's no conduit for that.
[01:01:33.464 - 01:01:35.026] Host: But now, if they're virtual,
[01:01:35.170 - 01:01:37.854] Host: They're now mentors for each character.
[01:01:38.094 - 01:01:39.997] Host: So we go into like, this is what we want to say.
[01:01:40.017 - 01:01:41.059] Host: Is it okay politically?
[01:01:41.740 - 01:01:43.142] Host: This is the kind of lyrics which I couldn't come.
[01:01:43.603 - 01:01:51.755] Host: And the lyricists there are, I'm composing all the stuff, but then we have partners like people like Ed Sheeran, they promised to write songs for this.
[01:01:51.855 - 01:01:53.698] Host: He was hearing a couple of songs.
[01:01:53.738 - 01:01:54.258] Host: I love this.
[01:01:54.318 - 01:01:55.040] Host: I want to do something.
[01:01:55.140 - 01:01:57.283] Guest: So these are virtual characters.
[01:01:57.363 - 01:01:57.864] Host: Virtual characters.
[01:01:58.144 - 01:02:01.830] Guest: You are the mentor for say one virtual character amongst all of them.
[01:02:01.850 - 01:02:02.611] Guest: Mentor for the whole band.
[01:02:02.711 - 01:02:03.452] Guest: For the whole band.
[01:02:03.552 - 01:02:04.754] Guest: All of my digital children.
[01:02:04.898 - 01:02:05.259] Guest: Right.
[01:02:05.819 - 01:02:07.001] Host: And they will create songs?
[01:02:07.582 - 01:02:08.363] Host: They want to create songs.
[01:02:08.603 - 01:02:09.605] Host: So they're human people.
[01:02:10.306 - 01:02:12.950] Host: Like in a movie, James Bond movie comes in.
[01:02:13.230 - 01:02:14.152] Host: James Bond is a character.
[01:02:14.753 - 01:02:17.216] Host: People keep changing, but James Bond is constant.
[01:02:17.236 - 01:02:18.238] Host: Superman is constant.
[01:02:18.278 - 01:02:19.379] Host: Spider-Man is constant.
[01:02:19.399 - 01:02:20.741] Host: So these people will be constant.
[01:02:20.761 - 01:02:21.222] Host: Exactly.
[01:02:21.563 - 01:02:22.264] Host: They'll be constant.
[01:02:22.284 - 01:02:25.689] Host: The voices might change because they're all live voices, right?
[01:02:25.709 - 01:02:26.370] Host: Live musicians.
[01:02:26.690 - 01:02:27.672] Host: Live musicians want to play with it.
[01:02:28.233 - 01:02:31.037] Host: So it's not AI created, contented, composition or anything.
[01:02:31.157 - 01:02:31.738] Host: It's all live.
[01:02:32.639 - 01:02:33.921] Host: They're only the face of that.
[01:02:34.322 - 01:02:34.642] Guest: Right.
[01:02:35.778 - 01:02:47.113] Host: They won't have flash and bled, but what's going to appear on TV or in a show will be real because of the technology hologram.
[01:02:47.894 - 01:02:55.965] Guest: And why would this be better than, say, if Ed Sheeran is writing a song for one of those characters, him singing it himself and having his face on it?
[01:02:56.846 - 01:02:58.248] Guest: Because this is a multicultural band.
[01:02:58.629 - 01:02:59.670] Host: They stand for the whole world.
[01:03:01.352 - 01:03:02.214] Host: Yeah.
[01:03:02.234 - 01:03:03.295] Host: There is no band like this.
[01:03:04.597 - 01:03:05.458] Host: Either you see
[01:03:05.858 - 01:03:07.180] Host: k-pop band were all Koreans.
[01:03:08.021 - 01:03:09.343] Host: In English band, they're all English.
[01:03:10.425 - 01:03:16.133] Host: And very rarely you see this kind of eclectic, diverse band coming together, right?
[01:03:16.935 - 01:03:24.366] Host: And me being not in just one genre of stuff, and film music has taught me to be expansive, right?
[01:03:24.947 - 01:03:32.658] Host: So I felt like taking the burden on myself to see how much I can go dwell in it, making it pop.
[01:03:32.678 - 01:03:33.700] Guest: I'm not able to picture it.
[01:03:33.720 - 01:03:35.282] Guest: Do you think an audience will
[01:03:35.842 - 01:03:38.965] Guest: I mean, the same premise, I guess, in a way applies to movies.
[01:03:40.246 - 01:03:41.968] Host: Did you see the ABBA Voyager?
[01:03:42.388 - 01:03:42.628] Host: Yeah.
[01:03:42.649 - 01:03:43.529] Guest: The hologram, right?
[01:03:43.850 - 01:03:44.050] Host: Yeah.
[01:03:44.430 - 01:03:49.295] Host: So this is probably a diverse version and maybe seventh generation of that.
[01:03:50.156 - 01:03:50.316] Guest: Right.
[01:03:50.616 - 01:03:53.018] Host: That was like, created seven years back, right?
[01:03:53.679 - 01:03:55.241] Host: This is today's technology.
[01:03:55.261 - 01:04:02.568] Host: Was that kind of playing on memory because everybody kind of... Yeah, but then being a songwriter and I just tested all the songs.
[01:04:03.749 - 01:04:05.170] Host: I was testing all the songs.
[01:04:05.538 - 01:04:07.160] Host: trying to see whether they like the music or not.
[01:04:08.000 - 01:04:13.025] Host: So all kinds of nationalities, like people from America, England, Ukraine.
[01:04:14.046 - 01:04:14.987] Host: And it tested very well.
[01:04:15.388 - 01:04:19.091] Host: At least three to four songs tested like, I like this.
[01:04:19.532 - 01:04:21.033] Host: They didn't mention the same song.
[01:04:21.213 - 01:04:22.655] Host: They mentioned four different songs.
[01:04:22.675 - 01:04:24.557] Host: So I felt like, okay, we're on a good track.
[01:04:25.157 - 01:04:27.259] Guest: And in the end case, what will be happening with this?
[01:04:29.121 - 01:04:30.543] Host: They will be performing.
[01:04:30.623 - 01:04:33.906] Host: They could also perform in three different places too, at the same time.
[01:04:33.986 - 01:04:37.810] Host: omnipotent because they're virtual, right?
[01:04:37.930 - 01:04:41.434] Host: They could be performing in England, in India, in Dubai all the same time.
[01:04:42.275 - 01:04:43.917] Host: Different teams can come in.
[01:04:44.277 - 01:04:46.340] Host: And they could become a series.
[01:04:46.540 - 01:04:47.601] Host: They could become a movie.
[01:04:48.522 - 01:04:49.503] Host: Have you seen NFTs?
[01:04:50.664 - 01:04:50.864] Host: Yes.
[01:04:51.745 - 01:04:53.788] Guest: This kind of like...
[01:04:53.808 - 01:04:54.428] Guest: It started like that.
[01:04:54.468 - 01:04:57.091] Host: It started like in a way when Hedara came to...
[01:04:57.111 - 01:05:01.316] Host: It started like, can we do a crypto NFT kind of thing?
[01:05:01.336 - 01:05:03.218] Host: I said like, we need a bigger idea.
[01:05:03.426 - 01:05:05.188] Host: The bigger idea is this.
[01:05:05.689 - 01:05:08.232] Host: And let other stuff source come from here.
[01:05:08.973 - 01:05:11.977] Host: Because even if that goes off like a fad, this will stay.
[01:05:12.097 - 01:05:12.858] Host: The music will stay.
[01:05:14.600 - 01:05:17.424] Host: The vision of this band stays and what they're going to say.
[01:05:18.385 - 01:05:19.967] Host: So it's a solid idea.
[01:05:20.368 - 01:05:23.652] Host: So that's one of the reasons why even after three years, we all excited about it.
[01:05:24.273 - 01:05:31.762] Host: And every inch we move towards getting it out, we feel like, because it's evolving.
[01:05:32.674 - 01:05:36.740] Host: When we started, it was a game engine, Unreal Engine, and Meta-Humans.
[01:05:37.481 - 01:05:48.778] Host: Now we have AI technology, which enhances the face, enhances not generative, but face-wapping and all the stuff, which might used to take a long time.
[01:05:49.599 - 01:05:51.542] Host: And then even the capture is much faster.
[01:05:52.283 - 01:05:56.810] Host: It cleans the capture, which sometimes you have some stutters with those costumes.
[01:05:57.551 - 01:05:58.732] Host: I can send you all the footage.
[01:05:58.752 - 01:05:59.774] Host: Yeah, I'd love to see it.
[01:06:00.375 - 01:06:02.578] Guest: Tomorrow, if there was a movie with, say,
[01:06:03.362 - 01:06:13.111] Guest: Shah Rukh Khan and a particular actress, not really them, but artificially generated movie, would you watch it?
[01:06:13.752 - 01:06:15.353] Guest: There are so many movies like that, you don't even know.
[01:06:16.955 - 01:06:19.337] Host: Half the movie is... No, the 100% of the movie.
[01:06:19.377 - 01:06:20.058] Host: 100% of movie?
[01:06:20.198 - 01:06:20.979] Host: It depends on the story.
[01:06:21.820 - 01:06:25.703] Host: You don't do what a Shah Rukh Khan will do well.
[01:06:26.264 - 01:06:27.305] Host: You don't try to imitate that.
[01:06:27.505 - 01:06:30.588] Host: That will be mediocre of this band.
[01:06:30.608 - 01:06:32.850] Host: They have to do things which only they can do.
[01:06:33.538 - 01:06:36.261] Host: because they have the superpower to do stuff, right?
[01:06:37.223 - 01:06:56.907] Host: So that is important because I've seen a lot of people use AI, generate a TV serial, which is, you know, TV serial actors can do better than what this generates, but you do stuff which will be impossible for production or to finance or to act and do, and give that experience, which is transformative.
[01:06:57.548 - 01:07:02.674] Guest: Once you've been able to articulate an expression and voice and program it in,
[01:07:02.978 - 01:07:06.562] Guest: Long term, these AI characters will inevitably...
[01:07:06.582 - 01:07:07.283] Host: They're not AI characters.
[01:07:07.343 - 01:07:09.025] Host: They are real characters.
[01:07:09.406 - 01:07:14.011] Host: It took nine months to illustrate, to get the nose, the eyes, the smile and everything.
[01:07:14.352 - 01:07:18.577] Guest: No, but these characters will always do better than real world humans.
[01:07:18.597 - 01:07:21.020] Host: No, that's... We...
[01:07:21.040 - 01:07:21.821] Host: I'm the founder of that.
[01:07:22.201 - 01:07:29.810] Host: So, I determined and I've set the rules, the parameters for what, how much it can talk, how much money it can send to each fan.
[01:07:30.732 - 01:07:32.754] Host: All this stuff will be set by our team.
[01:07:32.834 - 01:07:34.896] Guest: Why would it send money to a fan?
[01:07:35.697 - 01:07:36.298] Host: That's a secret.
[01:07:37.459 - 01:07:45.367] Host: So just to be like, I think if they make money, the band makes money, what can they share the money to with people who deserve.
[01:07:46.128 - 01:08:02.706] Host: And so that is the whole ultimate plan that they benefit not just by watching it, but you know, that is the whole by going to things which humans might be corrupted, but with the kind of transparency which
[01:08:03.778 - 01:08:08.123] Host: systems can run and do all the checks and balances as possible.
[01:08:08.584 - 01:08:19.177] Guest: I know people have attempted this with social media where super users got a percentage of the traction or the revenue that the social media platform earned overall.
[01:08:19.237 - 01:08:30.371] Guest: So here you're saying because the success of the character is dependent on the amount of traction which in turn is dependent on the fan, you would share a part of the revenue with them.
[01:08:30.872 - 01:08:31.393] Guest: That is the plan.
[01:08:32.134 - 01:08:32.434] Host: Right.
[01:08:32.514 - 01:08:33.876] Guest: And in future...
[01:08:34.197 - 01:08:36.360] Guest: So you become the platform which collects a rake in a way?
[01:08:36.440 - 01:08:38.884] Host: Even in the future, even the website will have all six of them.
[01:08:39.565 - 01:08:39.685] Unknown: Right.
[01:08:39.885 - 01:08:40.666] Host: You can talk to each of them.
[01:08:41.047 - 01:08:41.768] Host: They'll answer back.
[01:08:42.469 - 01:08:45.354] Host: This is not a real human answering back though.
[01:08:45.574 - 01:08:48.599] Host: No, the parameters are set by all the data.
[01:08:48.919 - 01:08:53.546] Host: All the information or all the wisdom which each character wants to.
[01:08:54.207 - 01:08:55.169] Host: Which comes from the mentors.
[01:08:55.589 - 01:09:01.298] Host: Which comes from the research of what does an African person
[01:09:01.634 - 01:09:02.675] Host: want the world to hear.
[01:09:03.676 - 01:09:06.459] Host: What is the unsaid narrative about that?
[01:09:06.779 - 01:09:10.663] Host: Or what does North Indian wants to, what does South Indian...
[01:09:10.683 - 01:09:13.085] Host: I just put that because it's... We are different.
[01:09:13.525 - 01:09:16.128] Host: Like, Punjabi is different from Tamil, right?
[01:09:16.828 - 01:09:19.090] Host: And extremes, North and South.
[01:09:19.871 - 01:09:22.374] Host: And a Chinese person, an Irish person.
[01:09:23.054 - 01:09:23.955] Host: You have great history.
[01:09:24.596 - 01:09:26.017] Host: The great history in every character.
[01:09:26.558 - 01:09:30.281] Guest: And you would scrape news to figure out bias and narrative?
[01:09:30.361 - 01:09:31.282] Host: No, it is just a...
[01:09:31.970 - 01:09:39.298] Host: From a common perspective and in the middle ground, I think when you look at things, there are a lot of unfair things which has happened to many, many races.
[01:09:39.638 - 01:09:40.840] Host: We're undeniable.
[01:09:42.561 - 01:09:54.434] Host: And even if you look at the genocide in Africa, which has happened, which is more than any other genocide in the world is unfortunate, but the world, it is not a political band.
[01:09:54.995 - 01:09:56.997] Host: They're not going to do political stuff.
[01:09:57.017 - 01:10:01.522] Host: But I feel the gravitas of that is very important for,
[01:10:01.666 - 01:10:10.895] Host: A ban coming from India which is just, which is pure in thinking and which is entertaining first of all, not boring, telling advice.
[01:10:10.916 - 01:10:11.937] Guest: Would it speak about society?
[01:10:12.757 - 01:10:13.038] Guest: Of course.
[01:10:13.778 - 01:10:16.061] Guest: But when you speak about society, you become political.
[01:10:16.081 - 01:10:17.883] Guest: I think you'll find the balance.
[01:10:18.483 - 01:10:21.226] Guest: AI will help.
[01:10:21.246 - 01:10:28.914] Guest: This is an interesting debate happening in the US now, where if I'm the New York Times,
[01:10:30.050 - 01:10:32.873] Guest: I'm the editor of The New York Times.
[01:10:32.893 - 01:10:39.181] Guest: If a journalist writing an article under The New York Times says something which is defamatory, I'm liable.
[01:10:40.342 - 01:10:43.947] Guest: The same question then starts to apply for a large language model.
[01:10:44.307 - 01:10:44.848] Host: Absolutely.
[01:10:44.868 - 01:10:47.131] Guest: If the output they are throwing out, are they liable?
[01:10:47.171 - 01:10:49.834] Host: So much of a responsibility, yes.
[01:10:49.854 - 01:10:50.475] Host: They claim not.
[01:10:50.955 - 01:10:52.958] Host: No, but then that's why we have to set the parameters.
[01:10:54.299 - 01:10:54.860] Host: Very important.
[01:10:56.142 - 01:10:58.084] Host: Sometimes you can't say the truth, just keep quiet.
[01:10:59.165 - 01:10:59.826] Host: Right.
[01:11:00.354 - 01:11:09.926] Host: I think because it's music and because it's about entertainment, we don't have to go into that stuff unnecessarily in the conflicts.
[01:11:09.946 - 01:11:14.051] Host: It's very important to entertain in a way where people get hope and faith.
[01:11:16.554 - 01:11:24.623] Guest: Someone said a passion ceases to be a passion when you truly understand it.
[01:11:26.085 - 01:11:27.627] Host: The good thing about music is you never understand it.
[01:11:28.929 - 01:11:30.130] Host: It's constant evolution.
[01:11:30.402 - 01:11:41.775] Host: That's why they say, no, like if you paint with the right hand constantly and you get comfortable with it, you know, tie your right hand and paint with the left hand.
[01:11:42.917 - 01:11:54.631] Host: But then you will find a different way because your mind wants to express and the limitation of what your left hand is will make its own art and it won't be like the comfort zone.
[01:11:54.831 - 01:11:55.492] Host: Oh, I can't do that.
[01:11:55.512 - 01:11:57.554] Host: So I'll do this and that'll be different.
[01:11:58.082 - 01:11:59.164] Host: So music is also like that.
[01:11:59.184 - 01:12:01.066] Host: Sometimes you just have to throw all the formulas.
[01:12:02.348 - 01:12:03.009] Host: I have to rethink.
[01:12:03.089 - 01:12:03.590] Host: I have to see.
[01:12:03.610 - 01:12:06.675] Host: I have to get there, but I don't want to go this route.
[01:12:07.776 - 01:12:08.497] Host: I'll go on this route.
[01:12:09.058 - 01:12:10.400] Host: Because you're the first listener.
[01:12:11.241 - 01:12:12.543] Host: The maker is the first listener.
[01:12:13.104 - 01:12:14.646] Host: Like the cook is the first taster, right?
[01:12:15.388 - 01:12:18.292] Guest: Whenever I cook food, I love it.
[01:12:18.312 - 01:12:20.836] Guest: No, because I don't know what it is.
[01:12:20.916 - 01:12:25.202] Guest: Like whenever I spend half an hour, 45 minutes making something,
[01:12:26.274 - 01:12:32.523] Guest: I'm inherently biased into liking what I've made because of the opportunity cost of time that has been invested.
[01:12:33.865 - 01:12:40.235] Guest: You're less judgmental or critical of... No, I'm very critical.
[01:12:40.936 - 01:12:41.436] Host: Right.
[01:12:41.456 - 01:12:48.747] Host: When I listen to it a couple of days later or a week later, you know what's working, what's not working.
[01:12:50.129 - 01:12:51.371] Host: What makes you... Oh, I love that.
[01:12:51.612 - 01:12:52.453] Host: Oh, this is boring.
[01:12:52.473 - 01:12:54.756] Host: I've heard this before.
[01:12:54.776 - 01:12:56.018] Host: I do a curation and...
[01:12:56.866 - 01:12:58.889] Host: then whichever thing I like, sometimes I don't like anything.
[01:13:00.331 - 01:13:01.953] Host: I'll go back to the drawing board.
[01:13:02.654 - 01:13:12.507] Guest: But how do you prioritize something like that where it's not what is earning you your wage but to focus on it enough to not give up?
[01:13:13.108 - 01:13:18.255] Host: I think what happens when you do something constantly, you get fatigued.
[01:13:19.436 - 01:13:20.518] Host: Your mind becomes tired.
[01:13:21.479 - 01:13:26.706] Host: And in this case where photography or anything else, poetry or
[01:13:27.458 - 01:13:29.561] Host: It's all part of the creative industry.
[01:13:29.581 - 01:13:32.746] Host: It's not like gambling or going away from something, losing money.
[01:13:32.886 - 01:13:42.460] Host: It is enhancing your, widening your imagination, widening your confidence in you that you can do much more.
[01:13:43.181 - 01:13:44.283] Guest: Are you still able to do that?
[01:13:44.423 - 01:13:45.265] Host: Pick up new hobbies?
[01:13:47.288 - 01:13:47.388] Unknown: Yeah.
[01:13:47.408 - 01:13:47.528] Host: Yeah.
[01:13:47.548 - 01:13:47.648] Host: Yeah.
[01:13:47.668 - 01:13:52.435] Host: Something which doesn't involve the display because all my life I've been sitting in front of a display.
[01:13:53.036 - 01:13:57.042] Host: So that's one of the reasons I don't play video games, any PlayStation or...
[01:13:57.346 - 01:14:00.209] Host: Xbox and all that stuff because then I don't want to sit in front of her.
[01:14:01.330 - 01:14:02.812] Host: And I wanted to try something organic.
[01:14:03.312 - 01:14:06.355] Host: So I'm going might go into farming a little bit more.
[01:14:07.616 - 01:14:08.958] Host: Are you farming now?
[01:14:08.978 - 01:14:12.722] Host: Yeah, we have a mom's plot, the trust plot.
[01:14:12.742 - 01:14:16.385] Host: So, you know, the house is one hour from Chennai.
[01:14:17.346 - 01:14:23.753] Host: That's where her Samadhi is also.
[01:14:23.773 - 01:14:24.914] Guest: Okay, this is on the work site.
[01:14:25.538 - 01:14:28.681] Guest: Tell us what's going on in the personal side.
[01:14:28.701 - 01:14:32.225] Guest: But personal, I don't mean like some controversial thing or anything like that.
[01:14:32.845 - 01:14:34.186] Guest: Where is your head space at?
[01:14:34.206 - 01:14:39.852] Guest: How are you looking at society, at music, at what is occupying mind?
[01:14:39.872 - 01:14:54.226] Host: I think what's beautiful about the past, I would say 18 years is starting the foundation, starting the music school and watching miracles happen there, you know, kids.
[01:14:55.106 - 01:15:02.353] Host: and demolishing the whole stigma saying that this caste is intelligent, this caste is not.
[01:15:03.054 - 01:15:04.075] Host: Demolishing all this stuff.
[01:15:04.615 - 01:15:08.719] Host: Any kid who is created by God, the light of God is in every kid.
[01:15:09.820 - 01:15:11.422] Host: And the knowledge comes from God.
[01:15:11.582 - 01:15:13.804] Host: It's not that they are worthy or not.
[01:15:14.185 - 01:15:21.932] Host: If they are taught properly and we find those kids, they shine, they become an orchestra and they all play together as one voice, as one emotion.
[01:15:22.673 - 01:15:23.954] Host: So that's what we discovered.
[01:15:24.066 - 01:15:28.012] Host: And it's a phenomenal breakthrough, which we are proud as a family.
[01:15:28.673 - 01:15:31.817] Host: My sister runs a school, I go there, I'm the mentor, I'm the principal.
[01:15:31.877 - 01:15:37.045] Host: And then recently went to Canada for the Glen Gold Foundation.
[01:15:37.866 - 01:15:39.849] Host: They invited us and they all played.
[01:15:40.690 - 01:15:51.346] Host: It's such a great moment to see kids from cooperation schools taking your flight, going to Canada and playing for, you know, billionaires sitting there.
[01:15:51.874 - 01:15:54.858] Host: That itself is a great statement, and that keeps me going.
[01:15:55.559 - 01:15:58.965] Host: If I'm the principal of that kind of kids, I need to be shining more.
[01:15:59.505 - 01:16:00.367] Host: I need to be working more.
[01:16:01.508 - 01:16:02.390] Host: And that keeps me going.
[01:16:02.971 - 01:16:21.458] Host: People ask me what keeps me going, is that I need to inspire my school children, my students, where we are teaching incredible artistry to sing or to play the piano, to compose, to inspire.
[01:16:22.178 - 01:16:28.285] Guest: Do you think humans can innately be altruistic, selfless?
[01:16:28.305 - 01:16:29.887] Host: It is how we brought up.
[01:16:30.587 - 01:16:48.207] Host: I've seen many people, many families, any religion, if they are coming from a great family, if their fathers and mothers are selfless and they act upon it, and they create a kind of system where the kids automatically get inspired, they look up to their father and mother.
[01:16:48.608 - 01:16:50.610] Host: If you go one level deeper,
[01:16:51.682 - 01:16:53.664] Host: Why is being selfless appealing?
[01:16:55.386 - 01:16:57.268] Host: I think it is hardwired.
[01:16:57.988 - 01:17:03.714] Host: Like, if you look at every spiritual teaching in the world is to serve.
[01:17:05.115 - 01:17:08.839] Host: Only when you serve, somebody served and built you this house.
[01:17:08.859 - 01:17:10.281] Host: Somebody served and built the road.
[01:17:11.342 - 01:17:15.826] Host: And they might be dead, but their soul is there in every... And somebody built a school.
[01:17:15.846 - 01:17:19.570] Guest: Did they do it with the intent of service or did they do it with the intent of...
[01:17:19.778 - 01:17:21.980] Guest: individual gain that they were chasing?
[01:17:22.000 - 01:17:23.922] Host: Of course, I mean, everybody needs to run the family.
[01:17:24.943 - 01:17:32.830] Host: But when you think about they're not there, you can see the sweat, you can see the, and everybody wants their work to shine.
[01:17:33.331 - 01:17:33.591] Guest: Right.
[01:17:33.611 - 01:17:34.973] Host: And they want the work to excel.
[01:17:35.013 - 01:17:37.795] Host: That means it's just so Excel is not mediocre.
[01:17:38.216 - 01:17:39.657] Unknown: Right.
[01:17:39.677 - 01:17:40.978] Host: There's a sincerity is very important.
[01:17:40.998 - 01:17:44.802] Host: The sincerity is what makes them tick.
[01:17:44.822 - 01:17:45.603] Host: Get them another job.
[01:17:47.084 - 01:17:49.106] Host: If I'm not sincere in my music, they're going to throw me out.
[01:17:50.114 - 01:17:51.736] Host: I think you're way beyond that.
[01:17:52.156 - 01:17:52.657] Host: No, I'm just saying.
[01:17:53.538 - 01:17:54.279] Host: I mean, nobody.
[01:17:55.060 - 01:17:55.821] Host: Anybody can be thrown.
[01:17:55.941 - 01:17:57.903] Host: Anybody can cease to exist.
[01:17:59.585 - 01:18:02.249] Host: Because if I'm not sincere to that thing, I'm not sincere to myself.
[01:18:04.752 - 01:18:10.959] Host: I won't be able to sleep if I let a mix pass by or a song which could be better and I didn't work enough for that.
[01:18:12.040 - 01:18:14.143] Host: That will be the biggest punishment or self-torture for me.
[01:18:15.605 - 01:18:20.050] Host: For at least three to four months, I should have done that, but I should have done that.
[01:18:20.130 - 01:18:23.014] Host: I never give that chance for my mind to torture me.
[01:18:24.996 - 01:18:26.919] Host: Even at the cost of getting a bad name from the producer.
[01:18:29.061 - 01:18:30.443] Guest: So I'll share a secret.
[01:18:30.503 - 01:18:40.656] Guest: I was going through some, I would not say bad time, but I would say I was feeling vulnerable because of some issue being blamed for something that I didn't have anything to do with.
[01:18:40.716 - 01:18:42.658] Guest: And I was sitting and thinking about all these things.
[01:18:44.761 - 01:18:48.626] Guest: When I have been altruistic, is it
[01:18:51.010 - 01:18:54.915] Guest: because the projection of altruism has appealed.
[01:18:54.935 - 01:18:56.698] Guest: Because in the society that...
[01:18:56.938 - 01:19:07.332] Guest: So if I go back in time, when I think about it, all men are competing with each other at some level.
[01:19:07.753 - 01:19:14.402] Guest: The hunter-gatherer, the biggest hunter got more validation and importance in the society that he was in.
[01:19:14.442 - 01:19:17.746] Guest: So everybody wanted to be the biggest hunter at that time.
[01:19:18.050 - 01:19:34.391] Guest: And I think with evolution society has kind of progressed like that, in the capitalistic society, the projection of being selfless is a value add.
[01:19:34.411 - 01:19:39.737] Host: So I think we are spiritually oriented, if you believe in God, whichever God.
[01:19:40.298 - 01:19:41.660] Host: There's only one creator, right?
[01:19:42.080 - 01:19:43.202] Host: We call them in different names.
[01:19:44.303 - 01:19:46.706] Host: So if I take that path,
[01:19:46.946 - 01:19:47.727] Host: There might be atheists.
[01:19:47.827 - 01:19:48.628] Host: I respect everybody.
[01:19:49.830 - 01:19:54.095] Host: I've taken that path where I feel like every breath is a blessing to me.
[01:19:55.277 - 01:19:57.660] Host: Every opportunity is a blessing to me.
[01:19:57.900 - 01:19:58.941] Host: And it comes from one source.
[01:19:59.302 - 01:20:00.463] Host: It comes from me surrendering.
[01:20:01.565 - 01:20:02.606] Host: That I don't have to worry.
[01:20:02.626 - 01:20:04.909] Host: I will be truthful.
[01:20:04.969 - 01:20:07.773] Host: I'll, you know, I'll remember you.
[01:20:09.014 - 01:20:09.755] Host: And he remembers me.
[01:20:11.237 - 01:20:15.122] Host: And if my share, which he wants to give, has to come to me,
[01:20:15.714 - 01:20:17.877] Host: Even if the whole world is against it, it's going to come to me.
[01:20:18.678 - 01:20:19.459] Host: Right?
[01:20:20.220 - 01:20:24.926] Host: And if I don't deserve something, and if I want that, if it's not my share, it will never come to me.
[01:20:25.567 - 01:20:27.069] Host: So it's simple to be peaceful.
[01:20:27.350 - 01:20:28.732] Host: I take this as a formula.
[01:20:29.453 - 01:20:31.335] Host: If anybody does, so there's no cause of jealousy.
[01:20:32.417 - 01:20:39.106] Host: If somebody is in a better car and a better house or I said, his share is, his share is coming.
[01:20:39.266 - 01:20:39.666] Host: It's great.
[01:20:40.808 - 01:20:41.188] Host: I love it.
[01:20:41.409 - 01:20:43.852] Host: I praise God for that and maybe live happy.
[01:20:44.252 - 01:20:45.394] Host: So you don't have the,
[01:20:45.762 - 01:20:47.484] Host: the root of jealousy is now killed.
[01:20:49.065 - 01:20:54.310] Host: And if I need something like that, my worthiness has to be improved.
[01:20:55.671 - 01:20:58.894] Host: Once I'm worthy, suppose I'm going to get 100 kgs, I need to handle it.
[01:20:59.635 - 01:21:00.196] Host: I need to take it.
[01:21:00.596 - 01:21:01.717] Host: Otherwise it's going to destroy me.
[01:21:02.638 - 01:21:10.526] Host: I've seen many people be given something which is very valuable and that will destroy their whole lives because they're not able to take that much.
[01:21:10.546 - 01:21:15.250] Host: So each one gets what they share by becoming worthy of it.
[01:21:15.746 - 01:21:22.012] Host: become the vessel, empty vessel which can and become cleaner and then you'll get all that gift.
[01:21:22.032 - 01:21:25.235] Host: I think this over years you realize that one.
[01:21:25.996 - 01:21:27.237] Host: Oh, I didn't get that project.
[01:21:27.358 - 01:21:29.560] Host: I didn't I'm not famous in this area.
[01:21:29.600 - 01:21:30.641] Host: So you become worthy you'll get.
[01:21:32.202 - 01:21:39.009] Guest: So do you feel like that you are probably one of the proudest sons of our country ever?
[01:21:39.389 - 01:21:42.873] Host: No, I'm just saying like we can get sometimes when we're human, right?
[01:21:43.634 - 01:21:43.954] Host: Oh,
[01:21:44.066 - 01:21:45.408] Host: That music is selling well.
[01:21:45.888 - 01:21:48.491] Host: It crossing two billion streams.
[01:21:48.531 - 01:21:49.432] Host: I was like, fine.
[01:21:51.775 - 01:21:55.459] Host: So my share is always coming to me and I'm working for it.
[01:21:56.220 - 01:22:00.124] Host: And each day, I'm trying to become worthy of something else.
[01:22:01.125 - 01:22:01.346] Host: Right?
[01:22:03.308 - 01:22:07.072] Host: I know you follow Islam and mostly Sufism because Sufism.
[01:22:08.934 - 01:22:12.178] Host: My quest to religion was more spiritual.
[01:22:13.058 - 01:22:15.421] Host: because I've been in...
[01:22:15.441 - 01:22:17.343] Host: I'm a fan of all the religions, right?
[01:22:17.363 - 01:22:20.788] Host: I've studied Christianity and Hinduism and Islam.
[01:22:21.008 - 01:22:23.151] Guest: I think every religion has something beautiful about it.
[01:22:24.312 - 01:22:41.554] Guest: But I also keep trying to figure out the intricacies of what makes one religion different from another and why one works depending on the... My problem is killing people in the name of religion.
[01:22:41.634 - 01:22:44.598] Host: or harming people or abusing people in the name of religion.
[01:22:44.618 - 01:22:45.720] Host: It's not cool for me.
[01:22:46.621 - 01:22:55.414] Host: Like, I feel like it is a tool to discover greater things and you have to go, which is the core of humanity, right?
[01:22:56.876 - 01:22:58.839] Host: And that's one of the reasons why I love music.
[01:23:00.000 - 01:23:00.741] Host: I love to entertain.
[01:23:01.002 - 01:23:03.045] Host: I think when I perform, I feel like it's a shrine.
[01:23:03.666 - 01:23:09.554] Host: We're all enjoying the fruits of, you know, oneness in a stadium.
[01:23:09.890 - 01:23:18.921] Host: You don't even know some people believe, some people don't believe, and they come from different nationalities, different languages, and one sound, and one happiness, and one ecstasy, which is beautiful.
[01:23:19.402 - 01:23:22.305] Host: That's what the wonderment tour is about, which I am doing.
[01:23:22.325 - 01:23:23.707] Host: Can you tell me more about Sufism?
[01:23:23.907 - 01:23:24.508] Host: I'm very interested.
[01:23:25.369 - 01:23:27.932] Host: Sufism is... Somebody gave me two books to read about this.
[01:23:27.993 - 01:23:31.677] Host: Okay, the simple thing is to discover yourselves.
[01:23:31.697 - 01:23:33.359] Host: How do you discover yourselves?
[01:23:33.379 - 01:23:34.300] Host: Because you have screens.
[01:23:35.322 - 01:23:38.866] Host: Your true self is screened.
[01:23:39.138 - 01:23:42.122] Host: And to remove those screens, you have to perish.
[01:23:44.585 - 01:23:49.552] Host: So when you perish, you become a part of the light.
[01:23:50.033 - 01:23:52.596] Guest: You are saying when you are alive, perish, take out ego in a way.
[01:23:52.717 - 01:23:52.977] Host: Yeah.
[01:23:53.197 - 01:23:55.160] Host: So it's like dying before dying.
[01:23:56.201 - 01:23:56.762] Host: What is death?
[01:23:57.263 - 01:24:02.550] Host: The death of lust, the death of greed, the death of jealousy, the death of judgmentalism.
[01:24:02.570 - 01:24:04.192] Guest: But like Buddhism, take away desire.
[01:24:04.212 - 01:24:04.953] Host: No, this is different.
[01:24:05.274 - 01:24:08.498] Host: When you remove everything, the drop
[01:24:08.802 - 01:24:09.563] Host: mingles the version.
[01:24:09.863 - 01:24:10.404] Host: That's it.
[01:24:10.424 - 01:24:11.806] Host: Then there's no drop, there's no version.
[01:24:12.767 - 01:24:13.368] Host: Metaphorically.
[01:24:14.249 - 01:24:15.611] Host: So we are all in the process.
[01:24:15.671 - 01:24:17.373] Host: We know some people achieve it early.
[01:24:17.413 - 01:24:21.038] Host: And when they achieve it early, they go off, they pass off.
[01:24:21.058 - 01:24:24.562] Host: So when that happens is your voice becomes the voice of God.
[01:24:24.742 - 01:24:27.326] Host: Your deeds become the voice, the deeds of God.
[01:24:28.087 - 01:24:30.510] Host: Your sight becomes the sight of God.
[01:24:30.990 - 01:24:36.978] Host: So your ego is gone and then you become transparent to the divine.
[01:24:37.922 - 01:24:39.725] Host: So this is the main essence of it.
[01:24:40.206 - 01:24:46.495] Host: So when you say Awliya, the saints who are like Hajj Ali Sahib or Khwaja Sahib.
[01:24:48.118 - 01:24:49.480] Host: So they've achieved that status.
[01:24:49.780 - 01:24:53.626] Host: And when you go to a place like that, you don't worship them.
[01:24:53.666 - 01:25:01.799] Host: You go on a place where they're surrounded with spiritual beings like angels who are praying constantly because that place is blessed.
[01:25:02.560 - 01:25:06.546] Host: So when you pray there, it's effective much more to God.
[01:25:06.882 - 01:25:08.304] Host: than in a normal place.
[01:25:08.324 - 01:25:09.165] Host: Same with the temple place.
[01:25:09.185 - 01:25:09.886] Host: It's like a gathering.
[01:25:09.926 - 01:25:14.712] Host: Like if you go in a place where intelligent people are, it sticks to you.
[01:25:14.893 - 01:25:16.194] Host: You get that knowledge, right?
[01:25:16.415 - 01:25:18.017] Guest: Like energy you believe in, in a way.
[01:25:18.037 - 01:25:18.177] Guest: Energy.
[01:25:18.357 - 01:25:19.038] Guest: Correct.
[01:25:19.058 - 01:25:24.946] Guest: Like if you go to a temple which has like the Rupati Aayu every year, you do feel a certain way.
[01:25:24.966 - 01:25:25.166] Guest: Yeah.
[01:25:25.367 - 01:25:28.871] Host: There's a secret of every spiritual place and uneniable, I think.
[01:25:29.252 - 01:25:30.714] Host: Every spiritual place?
[01:25:30.734 - 01:25:30.914] Host: Yeah.
[01:25:31.174 - 01:25:34.699] Host: If people are going there, there's a blessing there.
[01:25:35.660 - 01:25:36.361] Host: There's honesty.
[01:25:36.381 - 01:25:36.882] Host: There is
[01:25:37.282 - 01:25:39.265] Host: The commonality of faith is what I love.
[01:25:39.285 - 01:25:41.948] Host: Like, you might be in a different religion, I might be in a different religion.
[01:25:41.968 - 01:25:45.993] Host: But the sincerity of the faith is what is measured, I feel.
[01:25:46.834 - 01:25:49.598] Host: That's what makes you do good things, that's what makes me do good things.
[01:25:50.659 - 01:25:53.263] Host: Not that I'm worshiping a God who's different, right?
[01:25:54.404 - 01:25:56.247] Host: So I might build a school, you might build a school.
[01:25:57.889 - 01:26:01.013] Host: But everything's benefited, humanity is benefited by that.
[01:26:02.955 - 01:26:05.138] Guest: I heard you say in another interview, Karma,
[01:26:05.602 - 01:26:06.863] Guest: Karma.
[01:26:06.883 - 01:26:08.946] Guest: This is leading towards karma as the answer.
[01:26:09.947 - 01:26:24.824] Host: I think in the belief of Sufism or Islam, you're judged by your deeds, right?
[01:26:24.944 - 01:26:30.390] Host: Not by how much money you have, what car you have, or how famous you are, but your deeds.
[01:26:31.832 - 01:26:32.933] Host: So that's why we're all spiritual.
[01:26:32.953 - 01:26:33.554] Host: We call us
[01:26:34.434 - 01:26:35.776] Host: Fuckies, spiritual beggars.
[01:26:36.117 - 01:26:39.462] Host: They might be rich in money, but poor in spirituality.
[01:26:39.662 - 01:26:45.651] Host: And that's one of the reasons why I consider myself as a spiritual beggar.
[01:26:46.552 - 01:26:52.862] Host: So I go to that castle, I sit near the beach or meditate just to get spiritually rich.
[01:26:54.304 - 01:26:58.210] Host: And spiritual richness comes in, and material richness follows, right?
[01:26:58.510 - 01:27:00.453] Host: If you need it, if you don't need it, it's fine.
[01:27:01.454 - 01:27:03.858] Host: And then there is the aura which comes to you
[01:27:04.066 - 01:27:05.808] Host: And it's just a blessing which comes to you.
[01:27:06.288 - 01:27:07.689] Host: So your work becomes successful.
[01:27:08.350 - 01:27:15.957] Host: What you do with intention becomes more...
[01:27:15.978 - 01:27:17.259] Guest: I appreciate it, I would say.
[01:27:19.321 - 01:27:21.102] Guest: I ask everybody what is spirituality.
[01:27:21.383 - 01:27:24.145] Guest: Some people tell me, they ask me if I am spiritual.
[01:27:24.205 - 01:27:25.707] Guest: I'm like, I don't even know what it means.
[01:27:26.568 - 01:27:27.969] Guest: What does spirituality mean to you?
[01:27:29.310 - 01:27:33.074] Host: The good deeds, being kind to serve humanity.
[01:27:33.442 - 01:27:35.906] Host: and to be respectful to your parents, to your neighbours.
[01:27:35.926 - 01:27:37.608] Guest: Is that morality or spirituality?
[01:27:37.788 - 01:27:38.369] Host: It is spiritual.
[01:27:40.032 - 01:27:41.394] Host: I mean, this is all part of Sharia.
[01:27:41.634 - 01:27:42.536] Host: If you look at...
[01:27:43.377 - 01:27:44.699] Host: Smiling is a part of Sharia.
[01:27:44.959 - 01:27:46.802] Host: Smiling at someone is the biggest charity.
[01:27:46.822 - 01:27:48.765] Host: If you don't have money to give, then you smile at them.
[01:27:49.606 - 01:27:50.828] Host: You know?
[01:27:50.848 - 01:27:53.532] Host: So...
[01:27:53.552 - 01:27:54.714] Host: The beauty of...
[01:27:55.034 - 01:27:56.116] Host: I mean, I'm just a student.
[01:27:56.276 - 01:27:57.518] Host: I'm not an expert in anything.
[01:27:58.539 - 01:27:59.501] Host: Don't take me seriously.
[01:28:00.903 - 01:28:03.026] Host: I'm constantly trying to imbibe
[01:28:03.106 - 01:28:06.049] Host: And I don't read stuff.
[01:28:06.069 - 01:28:07.230] Host: I want to experience things.
[01:28:07.271 - 01:28:09.553] Host: And then I realize, OK, that's true.
[01:28:09.573 - 01:28:13.017] Host: I don't read something and believe something, which is, oh, this is what it says.
[01:28:13.037 - 01:28:13.717] Host: And I believe in it.
[01:28:13.798 - 01:28:15.539] Host: But I want to knock at a door.
[01:28:15.580 - 01:28:16.400] Host: I should get an answer.
[01:28:17.061 - 01:28:20.084] Host: Whether it's music or spirituality, and that's how my life is.
[01:28:20.885 - 01:28:21.786] Host: I test out everything.
[01:28:22.968 - 01:28:23.228] Host: Right?
[01:28:23.408 - 01:28:29.254] Host: So even music, when they say something is good, everybody says, oh, that's a hit song.
[01:28:29.495 - 01:28:29.895] Host: Listen to it.
[01:28:29.915 - 01:28:32.658] Host: It was not good enough for me as I threw it out.
[01:28:32.962 - 01:28:36.328] Host: It has to do something to my heart, it has to do something to my soul.
[01:28:37.029 - 01:28:41.557] Host: And that's why I don't care when some of my songs fail.
[01:28:41.898 - 01:28:42.859] Host: I said, no, it's going to come back.
[01:28:43.280 - 01:28:44.903] Host: And three years later, what a song this is.
[01:28:44.923 - 01:28:45.804] Host: I said, yeah, I knew it.
[01:28:46.566 - 01:28:54.019] Host: So that self validation is very important to find, believe in your work and find why it is.
[01:28:54.039 - 01:28:55.922] Host: So in a way you want to give more than you take?
[01:28:56.322 - 01:28:59.006] Guest: if all case were balanced.
[01:28:59.026 - 01:29:01.630] Host: Music is giving and I'm getting so much love from people.
[01:29:03.313 - 01:29:05.075] Host: I feel worthless most of the time.
[01:29:05.436 - 01:29:06.117] Host: Do I need this?
[01:29:06.137 - 01:29:06.818] Host: Do I deserve this?
[01:29:08.220 - 01:29:08.961] Host: It makes you work harder.
[01:29:10.583 - 01:29:16.653] Guest: When I think of Indians, I think of politics that is one person who comes to mind.
[01:29:16.753 - 01:29:21.119] Guest: I think of cricket, maybe, Sachin and Virat come to mind.
[01:29:21.139 - 01:29:25.586] Guest: I think of artists acting wise, maybe,
[01:29:25.922 - 01:29:29.026] Guest: I don't know, Amitabh Bachchan, somebody like that comes to mind.
[01:29:29.046 - 01:29:34.513] Guest: When I think of music, not I, when the country thinks of music, you come to mind.
[01:29:38.477 - 01:29:52.054] Guest: They say that it's easy to be God-like if you get the validation and devotion that comes with being known as God.
[01:29:53.536 - 01:29:55.218] Guest: It's much harder for
[01:29:55.938 - 01:29:58.741] Guest: a normal person to be God, like, by virtue of that.
[01:30:00.343 - 01:30:00.883] Guest: Who's the God?
[01:30:01.624 - 01:30:03.226] Guest: You're known as the God.
[01:30:03.246 - 01:30:06.149] Guest: I mean, God of music in this domain for sure.
[01:30:06.489 - 01:30:07.611] Guest: No, they're just...
[01:30:07.631 - 01:30:08.632] Guest: I am such a big fan.
[01:30:08.672 - 01:30:18.603] Guest: Like, your song, Tuhire, I think I must have heard that song through so many, like, heartbreaks and falling in love and stuff like that.
[01:30:19.223 - 01:30:25.490] Guest: Maybe you wrote it for a completely different reason, but... Actually, you know, strangely, what happened was... Money wanted to...
[01:30:26.402 - 01:30:27.263] Host: he wanted a love song.
[01:30:28.485 - 01:30:29.346] Host: I was like, what love song?
[01:30:29.366 - 01:30:37.016] Host: And I was so famished and I was like sleeping and then this tune was coming to my mind.
[01:30:37.036 - 01:30:37.637] Host: It's so slow.
[01:30:38.218 - 01:30:38.959] Host: So anyway, it's coming.
[01:30:39.860 - 01:30:41.462] Host: It's like coming on my dream.
[01:30:42.143 - 01:30:44.547] Host: So I did my, I used to have a tape record, like mini cassette.
[01:30:44.667 - 01:30:45.668] Host: So I just recorded it.
[01:30:46.710 - 01:30:48.973] Host: And so next day I said, where is the tune?
[01:30:48.993 - 01:30:50.154] Host: I said, I got it on tune.
[01:30:50.174 - 01:30:52.157] Host: I was like, it's okay.
[01:30:52.337 - 01:30:53.258] Host: Let's record.
[01:30:54.140 - 01:30:54.861] Host: Then we recorded it.
[01:30:55.562 - 01:30:55.922] Host: And
[01:30:56.226 - 01:31:01.714] Host: So for the singers, I wanted SPB or Jay Siddharthas.
[01:31:02.616 - 01:31:03.878] Host: So I put also Hariharan's name.
[01:31:03.938 - 01:31:06.121] Host: And then I picked, I don't do that anymore.
[01:31:06.662 - 01:31:08.064] Host: So I prayed and picked one.
[01:31:08.665 - 01:31:10.147] Host: It had Hariharan's name.
[01:31:10.928 - 01:31:13.772] Host: So Hari is a very, very unusual singer for that song, right?
[01:31:14.433 - 01:31:14.874] Host: Why is that?
[01:31:15.235 - 01:31:16.076] Host: Because he's a Gazel singer.
[01:31:16.436 - 01:31:21.344] Host: And even now when he sings concerts, he does all the stuff.
[01:31:22.025 - 01:31:25.490] Host: He doesn't stand on one note because that's his style, right?
[01:31:25.570 - 01:31:29.415] Host: So we recorded it and then money shot it.
[01:31:30.756 - 01:31:33.960] Host: Then he called up, he said, Ayer, this song is doing something.
[01:31:33.980 - 01:31:35.542] Host: I just put it on it and it's magic.
[01:31:37.164 - 01:31:39.126] Host: I think we need to do a BGM when she's running.
[01:31:39.807 - 01:31:41.509] Host: Then we added all that music in it.
[01:31:41.529 - 01:31:43.451] Host: So it had an interesting history.
[01:31:45.413 - 01:31:46.655] Guest: No, incredible song.
[01:31:47.035 - 01:31:47.716] Guest: Love that song.
[01:31:49.498 - 01:31:52.722] Guest: But now that you're in this space,
[01:31:52.898 - 01:31:54.680] Guest: You're essentially God to all of us.
[01:31:54.900 - 01:31:55.561] Guest: No, no, no.
[01:31:56.001 - 01:31:57.063] Host: I'm a servant only.
[01:31:57.083 - 01:31:58.724] Host: How does that make you feel?
[01:31:58.745 - 01:32:00.526] Host: It's a double-edged sword, right?
[01:32:00.927 - 01:32:01.027] Host: Yeah.
[01:32:01.047 - 01:32:04.751] Host: It's like they say there's no fame without blame.
[01:32:06.173 - 01:32:09.436] Host: It just takes one second for people to completely turn the coin.
[01:32:09.977 - 01:32:11.118] Host: So I don't take it seriously.
[01:32:11.799 - 01:32:14.422] Host: I said, I'm sincere to what I believe in.
[01:32:15.063 - 01:32:18.647] Host: And even if I shouted people, I say, sorry, guys.
[01:32:19.608 - 01:32:20.369] Host: I'm human, right?
[01:32:20.769 - 01:32:21.650] Host: Sometimes the pressure.
[01:32:21.794 - 01:32:22.455] Host: I shouted people.
[01:32:22.575 - 01:32:26.018] Host: You don't look like somebody who can shout at people.
[01:32:26.038 - 01:32:27.019] Host: I come to my studio.
[01:32:27.540 - 01:32:27.980] Host: Not always.
[01:32:28.701 - 01:32:30.703] Host: You seem like you have a very calm...
[01:32:30.723 - 01:32:36.568] Host: I'm calm most of the time, but for me, my work sincerity is, it demands a lot.
[01:32:36.708 - 01:32:40.332] Host: If something is not happening, then I'm failing myself and failing the client.
[01:32:40.892 - 01:32:43.515] Guest: When was the last time you shouted at somebody and for what?
[01:32:43.535 - 01:32:43.875] Guest: Yesterday.
[01:32:44.596 - 01:32:44.896] Host: Really?
[01:32:48.200 - 01:32:50.802] Host: Just because it's a very demanding work.
[01:32:51.042 - 01:32:57.892] Host: Suppose you're having 77 tracks and then you want the strings to be loud or even, you know, EQing the strings or...
[01:32:57.912 - 01:32:58.553] Host: I need speed.
[01:32:59.794 - 01:33:00.936] Host: Musicians are passionate, right?
[01:33:01.797 - 01:33:07.445] Host: You don't want somebody to take like 30 minutes to get something which I think could just take one minute.
[01:33:09.428 - 01:33:10.630] Host: Is that what irritates you?
[01:33:10.650 - 01:33:12.152] Host: Something taking longer than it should?
[01:33:12.172 - 01:33:12.352] Host: No, no.
[01:33:12.432 - 01:33:16.178] Host: I'm just saying, like... My voice will be a little louder.
[01:33:16.198 - 01:33:19.282] Host: The dynamics will be forte, not cancer.
[01:33:19.842 - 01:33:21.184] Host: like musical language, they say.
[01:33:23.027 - 01:33:24.790] Guest: What are you looking forward to at this point?
[01:33:25.451 - 01:33:28.356] Guest: What are you scared of and what are you looking forward to?
[01:33:28.376 - 01:33:28.877] Guest: Scared of?
[01:33:30.720 - 01:33:32.282] Host: All the scary things have already happened in my life.
[01:33:33.504 - 01:33:36.629] Host: My father's death, my grandmother's death, my mother's death.
[01:33:37.751 - 01:33:43.060] Host: And I'm looking forward... And does it affect you in that order?
[01:33:44.402 - 01:33:44.802] Host: It did.
[01:33:44.842 - 01:33:47.026] Host: It made me completely numb.
[01:33:47.330 - 01:33:50.495] Host: It made me zen more, it made me believe that everybody is going to die.
[01:33:51.716 - 01:34:02.753] Host: So it kind of catching on to something and loving something deeply is a... unfortunately... Anti-spirituality.
[01:34:03.133 - 01:34:04.155] Host: It's not anti-spirituality.
[01:34:04.836 - 01:34:08.701] Host: As a loving, the true love is the love for God, I feel like.
[01:34:08.762 - 01:34:09.943] Host: Every other love is tested.
[01:34:10.785 - 01:34:14.190] Guest: And when you say God, you know we are saying universe.
[01:34:14.210 - 01:34:15.151] Guest: The Creator.
[01:34:15.892 - 01:34:17.234] Host: The Creator.
[01:34:17.538 - 01:34:25.848] Host: And I think we can learn from everything, from the plant, from the sea, from the mountain, from the sky, from the bird, from a microorganism.
[01:34:26.008 - 01:34:28.431] Guest: Is that where your music is most inspired by nature?
[01:34:29.332 - 01:34:29.752] Host: Absolutely.
[01:34:31.274 - 01:34:31.854] Host: Also, mathematically...
[01:34:31.875 - 01:34:42.667] Host: The enormity of... and the complexity of every creature, every creation, and in the galaxy, we're just not even a dot, right?
[01:34:42.687 - 01:34:45.330] Host: And the multiple galaxies, and it makes you humble.
[01:34:45.954 - 01:34:52.283] Host: how small you are, how... the micro and macro they say, right?
[01:34:52.303 - 01:34:53.685] Guest: Do you also look at that technically?
[01:34:53.725 - 01:35:03.238] Guest: Like, in my world of trading, we have Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio of... and try to find that in music or create music with that?
[01:35:03.258 - 01:35:04.340] Host: No, I just go by instinct.
[01:35:04.380 - 01:35:08.766] Host: I go by what would be interesting and what would be a good combination of things.
[01:35:10.769 - 01:35:12.211] Host: What are you most looking forward to?
[01:35:12.231 - 01:35:14.674] Host: I'm looking forward to the success of Secret Mountain.
[01:35:15.138 - 01:35:38.770] Host: if it deserves and because we are putting all our hard work and we want to create something extraordinary from India to the world and because we put three years of a life in it, you want to make this the most significant entity from India to the world.
[01:35:42.306 - 01:35:43.528] Host: Are you bored of movies now?
[01:35:43.548 - 01:35:44.269] Host: No, I'm never bored.
[01:35:44.830 - 01:35:50.678] Host: Because you know, if a western artist has to do an album, they have to think about it.
[01:35:51.619 - 01:35:56.106] Host: I'm getting help from the script, from the director, from the screenwriter, from the lyricist.
[01:35:56.126 - 01:35:57.788] Host: My part is just music, right?
[01:35:58.449 - 01:36:04.638] Host: So each album is different because the different combination of different consciousness comes together.
[01:36:05.439 - 01:36:08.504] Host: And we create with the intention of creating something great.
[01:36:08.924 - 01:36:10.066] Host: We push ourselves into
[01:36:10.786 - 01:36:12.268] Host: And then we have live feedback.
[01:36:13.309 - 01:36:15.953] Host: Each song, you know, how it's received and how people...
[01:36:17.355 - 01:36:18.957] Host: So that magic has not changed at all.
[01:36:19.277 - 01:36:25.746] Host: Like, what do you get from people, that instant feedback and their adulation in the concert, it's a great thing.
[01:36:26.507 - 01:36:27.388] Host: I never want to lose that.
[01:36:28.230 - 01:36:35.920] Host: And if I want to do anything, like I want to do a private album, instrumental album or a collaborative album, I'm free to do it.
[01:36:36.581 - 01:36:37.322] Host: Nobody's stopping me.
[01:36:38.744 - 01:36:40.466] Host: The big project right now is Ramayana.
[01:36:40.962 - 01:36:50.354] Host: There's Rama and there's so many Sacred Mountain and a couple of English ones going on.
[01:36:52.336 - 01:36:57.823] Host: And an Arabic movie, a composed horror movie called Bab.
[01:36:57.843 - 01:37:00.587] Guest: Namit showed me parts of Rama.
[01:37:00.887 - 01:37:01.908] Guest: It looks incredible.
[01:37:02.088 - 01:37:04.211] Guest: It sounds incredible.
[01:37:04.632 - 01:37:04.972] Guest: Thank you.
[01:37:05.693 - 01:37:09.778] Guest: Do you think there's a future to the movie business, the movie theatre business?
[01:37:10.018 - 01:37:11.500] Host: Theater business is not going anywhere.
[01:37:11.740 - 01:37:14.864] Host: It's going to stay, but it should be reinvented.
[01:37:14.884 - 01:37:15.505] Guest: Can you tell me how?
[01:37:16.546 - 01:37:19.951] Host: Because over 100 years now, we are still seeing a rectangle screen.
[01:37:20.932 - 01:37:23.295] Host: And of course, some 3D and all the stuff comes in.
[01:37:24.036 - 01:37:26.640] Host: I think immersive thing is the future, like the spear.
[01:37:27.000 - 01:37:28.342] Host: What's doing Vegas.
[01:37:29.503 - 01:37:32.407] Host: Everything looks so unbelievably spiritual.
[01:37:32.748 - 01:37:37.714] Host: And it's something very human about watching with that quality.
[01:37:38.786 - 01:37:40.628] Guest: I've never been there, but I've seen the videos.
[01:37:40.648 - 01:37:41.509] Host: It is incredible.
[01:37:41.749 - 01:37:42.330] Host: Yeah.
[01:37:42.350 - 01:37:43.151] Host: I think that's the future.
[01:37:43.712 - 01:37:48.857] Host: Because you can never get that in home entertainment or a phone or anything.
[01:37:48.917 - 01:37:52.101] Host: It's experience that kind of, it's incredible.
[01:37:52.722 - 01:37:57.787] Guest: So you're saying everybody can afford a big screen, not everybody, but a lot of people can afford a big screen at home.
[01:37:58.728 - 01:38:03.634] Guest: So the difference between a rectangle in your house and the rectangle in a movie theater
[01:38:03.938 - 01:38:05.540] Guest: Can't just be 10x the size.
[01:38:05.620 - 01:38:06.882] Guest: It has to be a bunch of things.
[01:38:07.303 - 01:38:07.803] Host: Exactly.
[01:38:07.823 - 01:38:23.364] Host: Especially now because now that we are being bombarded with the content, I hate that word, that you need to reinvent the way movies are made to get there so that they don't go to their, ah, it's boring.
[01:38:23.585 - 01:38:24.386] Host: I know what's going to happen.
[01:38:24.686 - 01:38:29.313] Host: So let me look at who's, you know, Instagram me or what's happening.
[01:38:30.034 - 01:38:33.298] Host: So that goes away because you're all stuck completely involved.
[01:38:34.530 - 01:38:35.712] Host: All the senses are active.
[01:38:35.852 - 01:38:43.243] Host: In Lemusk, we have scent, we have haptics, we have motion, we have 3D, we have ambisonic sound.
[01:38:44.425 - 01:38:48.351] Host: All the stuff comes in together, and that's a different experience.
[01:38:48.371 - 01:38:50.073] Host: But can a theater screen afford that?
[01:38:51.075 - 01:38:51.756] Host: That's not our problem.
[01:38:51.936 - 01:38:55.041] Host: When people make money, they would have to invest more money.
[01:38:55.862 - 01:38:56.603] Guest: But this company too.
[01:38:56.623 - 01:38:58.546] Host: Even each metro can have one, right?
[01:39:00.088 - 01:39:04.114] Host: And we don't even have a proper symphony hall in any of India.
[01:39:04.514 - 01:39:05.215] Host: Now nowhere.
[01:39:06.456 - 01:39:16.147] Host: And musical theatre is another important aspect of entertainment which could come in because we have so many talented singers, actors here and they're all looking at movies.
[01:39:17.349 - 01:39:24.317] Host: And if you look at London West End or Broadway or Canada or Australia, they are musical theatre and it travels.
[01:39:25.098 - 01:39:30.724] Host: Once you make one big hit, it travels all over the world forever for like years, 40 years, 50 years.
[01:39:31.706 - 01:39:32.146] Host: It's there.
[01:39:32.834 - 01:39:35.056] Host: Look at sound of music or Phantom of the Opera.
[01:39:36.097 - 01:39:37.238] Host: We have great stories to tell.
[01:39:37.519 - 01:39:40.101] Host: And I've seen men as a kid.
[01:39:40.121 - 01:39:43.524] Host: I've seen Parashuram, Ravaneshwara.
[01:39:44.906 - 01:39:46.767] Host: And that's it.
[01:39:46.787 - 01:39:49.590] Host: Now, I think the only one which I keep seeing is Mughal Yasm.
[01:39:50.611 - 01:39:52.013] Host: Nothing else significant in India.
[01:39:52.993 - 01:39:56.096] Host: I went for the Phantom premiere at NMACC.
[01:39:56.577 - 01:39:56.777] Host: Yeah.
[01:39:57.157 - 01:39:57.598] Host: Incredible.
[01:39:58.759 - 01:40:01.842] Host: And that's probably the only place which is world class in India.
[01:40:02.530 - 01:40:11.924] Guest: Is it a chicken and egg problem because the discretionary spending power of Indian audience is limited to a certain number?
[01:40:12.926 - 01:40:14.348] Host: Can you just think about an airport?
[01:40:15.069 - 01:40:16.171] Host: Oh, the airport is very costly.
[01:40:16.191 - 01:40:16.912] Host: Let's go on trains.
[01:40:16.932 - 01:40:17.292] Host: We can't.
[01:40:17.453 - 01:40:19.035] Host: It's a necessity for people.
[01:40:19.716 - 01:40:23.582] Host: They have a right to have proper infrastructure.
[01:40:23.602 - 01:40:24.303] Host: It's very important.
[01:40:25.024 - 01:40:31.634] Host: There should be enough places where it brings hope, pride, entertainment.
[01:40:33.506 - 01:40:40.875] Host: If you don't deliver that, they take a flight, they go to Germany, watch Hans Zimmer, and Phantom of the Opera in London, and they come and oh, that's so great.
[01:40:41.216 - 01:40:42.938] Host: Like, what about the person who can't afford that?
[01:40:43.398 - 01:40:44.119] Host: They don't deserve that?
[01:40:44.840 - 01:40:52.950] Host: They also deserve to see, you know, you are influencing minds which can become the next Einstein, or Ramana, or you know, Steve Jobs.
[01:40:53.811 - 01:40:54.973] Host: This is the way you should inspire them.
[01:40:55.173 - 01:41:00.660] Host: They don't need to see that only in America or England.
[01:41:00.680 - 01:41:02.322] Host: Our country is now prosperous enough to.
[01:41:03.234 - 01:41:06.438] Host: It's important to be in a chorus to say that we need this.
[01:41:07.639 - 01:41:12.004] Host: This is for future India, for our youth, for our children to experience all this stuff.
[01:41:13.185 - 01:41:15.748] Guest: If you were to give some advice, so our audience...
[01:41:15.868 - 01:41:18.531] Guest: I'm not good at advising.
[01:41:18.551 - 01:41:29.423] Guest: Our audience is largely wannabe entrepreneurs, young from India, who want to know what business to start, what company, what startup.
[01:41:31.004 - 01:41:32.466] Guest: In the live event space,
[01:41:32.770 - 01:41:37.836] Guest: Like there's Book My Show, there's District, there's a couple of concert organizers.
[01:41:38.777 - 01:41:43.603] Guest: If you could advise our audience to start a business in life, it's growing the fastest.
[01:41:44.444 - 01:41:48.890] Guest: In terms of rate of growth versus other form of entertainment, what could somebody start?
[01:41:50.632 - 01:41:51.133] Guest: Simple thing.
[01:41:53.696 - 01:41:54.417] Host: It's finding the void.
[01:41:57.601 - 01:41:59.663] Host: I find void in art.
[01:42:00.104 - 01:42:01.906] Host: Artistic stuff.
[01:42:02.370 - 01:42:07.418] Host: fashion, fashion is taken, I mean, definitely coming, like it's much better now.
[01:42:08.419 - 01:42:13.627] Host: But even furniture, like this furniture you have here, you can't buy it.
[01:42:15.450 - 01:42:16.010] Host: Nobody makes it.
[01:42:16.151 - 01:42:17.513] Host: They make something very boring.
[01:42:17.773 - 01:42:21.038] Host: It's copy pasted from 100 years back.
[01:42:22.020 - 01:42:25.365] Host: There's no imagination in any kind of furniture, which I see.
[01:42:26.747 - 01:42:29.010] Host: It comes from Indonesia or China or Malaysia.
[01:42:30.082 - 01:42:31.644] Host: I see a white there.
[01:42:32.105 - 01:42:34.928] Guest: It's because of scale that China has in producing these.
[01:42:34.969 - 01:42:36.190] Guest: But we should have scale.
[01:42:36.230 - 01:42:38.653] Guest: We have like more populations in China, right?
[01:42:39.254 - 01:42:40.957] Host: But they're producing for the world.
[01:42:41.617 - 01:42:42.459] Guest: So they get the cost.
[01:42:42.499 - 01:42:43.280] Host: I see the same thing.
[01:42:43.300 - 01:42:44.862] Host: Who's asking not to export?
[01:42:45.823 - 01:42:51.350] Host: And electronics, we still don't have like my keyboard.
[01:42:51.731 - 01:42:54.435] Host: I wish I play an Indian keyboard in my lifetime.
[01:42:55.116 - 01:42:56.978] Host: No, it's from Japan or US or
[01:42:57.474 - 01:42:59.997] Host: Germany or London, never from India.
[01:43:01.279 - 01:43:02.120] Host: Musical theatre, of course.
[01:43:03.001 - 01:43:07.628] Host: In my thing, definitely musical theatre, having an orchestra in every state is very important.
[01:43:08.308 - 01:43:10.672] Host: Having a world class, like a sphere kind of a thing.
[01:43:11.773 - 01:43:12.694] Host: Changing entertainment.
[01:43:12.754 - 01:43:15.398] Host: Entertainment is something which people need, people would.
[01:43:17.361 - 01:43:20.825] Guest: But if a sphere costs $500 million... No, I don't think so.
[01:43:21.166 - 01:43:24.350] Host: Everything is so slashed up, like all the LEDs you get so cheap now.
[01:43:25.211 - 01:43:27.474] Host: I mean, at that time maybe it would have costed that much money.
[01:43:28.514 - 01:43:29.375] Host: Not anymore, you think?
[01:43:29.515 - 01:43:30.016] Host: Not anymore.
[01:43:30.557 - 01:43:35.743] Host: I think definitely with the latest technologies much, it's probably one-hundredth of the price.
[01:43:36.424 - 01:43:38.787] Host: And you don't need that big a spare.
[01:43:39.828 - 01:43:46.797] Guest: Would that be something if somebody comes with a very interesting business pitch to build one of our young friends?
[01:43:47.398 - 01:43:48.719] Guest: Would you be interested in that?
[01:43:49.741 - 01:43:50.161] Host: Bring them in.
[01:43:50.181 - 01:43:51.243] Host: We'll create the content for that.
[01:43:52.144 - 01:43:53.906] Host: We'll create everything.
[01:43:58.434 - 01:44:00.798] Guest: Okay, I mean, I have no questions per se left.
[01:44:00.898 - 01:44:16.524] Guest: Last part, anything else you want to say, fleeting thoughts about the world, society, what is occupying your mind space that you're actually thinking about?
[01:44:16.544 - 01:44:19.890] Host: I stopped seeing the news literally from 2000.
[01:44:20.738 - 01:44:22.020] Host: 2001, after the war.
[01:44:22.260 - 01:44:22.821] Guest: Smart man.
[01:44:22.841 - 01:44:24.202] Guest: I think most people should stop.
[01:44:24.242 - 01:44:28.568] Host: And whenever I tried, sometimes, you know, if I get and go into streaming and then I see and then I get sick.
[01:44:29.609 - 01:44:41.824] Host: So I think the best choice for anybody is to look at your own family, your own welfare, your own parents, your kids and be kind to your friends with my neighbors.
[01:44:43.125 - 01:44:46.569] Host: And because if you think about the world, what's going to happen to the world.
[01:44:46.810 - 01:44:47.090] Guest: Yeah.
[01:44:47.170 - 01:44:48.712] Host: you miss what is going to happen to your family.
[01:44:48.752 - 01:44:51.615] Host: If you look after your family, the world will take care of itself.
[01:44:51.635 - 01:44:52.116] Guest: Makes sense.
[01:44:52.436 - 01:44:55.379] Guest: I think even back in the day, the world was going through problems.
[01:44:55.780 - 01:44:56.821] Guest: It's just today we are seeing the problems.
[01:44:56.841 - 01:44:58.583] Host: Now we are seeing everything like this close.
[01:44:59.344 - 01:45:01.166] Host: So every problem looks like big.
[01:45:02.087 - 01:45:06.412] Guest: Now we are wondering why is some crime happening in some corner of Africa.
[01:45:06.432 - 01:45:07.853] Guest: I'm sure it was happening 50 years ago.
[01:45:07.873 - 01:45:08.334] Guest: Absolutely.
[01:45:09.135 - 01:45:10.897] Host: Not that we are insensitive about it.
[01:45:11.017 - 01:45:15.602] Host: I think we just definitely have to develop a great justice system.
[01:45:15.842 - 01:45:20.809] Host: But it's important not to get disheartened and lose your faith in humanity.
[01:45:21.089 - 01:45:22.311] Host: Because you are humanity.
[01:45:22.331 - 01:45:23.432] Host: Each one of us is humanity.
[01:45:24.113 - 01:45:25.535] Host: Our good and bad affects humanity.
[01:45:25.976 - 01:45:28.038] Host: It's very important.
[01:45:28.058 - 01:45:29.520] Guest: Thank you so much for doing this.
[01:45:29.540 - 01:45:30.822] Guest: Would you like to finish with a song?
[01:45:31.343 - 01:45:32.645] Guest: Is it possible?
[01:45:32.665 - 01:45:33.626] Guest: I'll play you a clip.
[01:45:34.868 - 01:45:36.730] Guest: If I give you a guitar, would you like to...
[01:45:36.750 - 01:45:37.591] Guest: I don't play guitar much.
[01:45:38.052 - 01:45:38.993] Guest: I can play if you sing.
[01:45:40.055 - 01:45:41.216] Guest: If you tell me what chord to play.
[01:45:41.737 - 01:45:41.977] Guest: Wow.
[01:45:41.997 - 01:45:44.080] Guest: I don't know what...
[01:45:44.180 - 01:45:45.522] Guest: I'm just talking more now.
[01:45:46.562 - 01:45:48.124] Guest: But you do one minute, it'll look really nice.
[01:45:48.144 - 01:45:49.286] Guest: What do you say?
[01:45:49.306 - 01:45:51.268] Guest: Just bring that guitar from my bedroom, now.
[01:45:51.869 - 01:45:52.871] Guest: Bedroom guitarist, huh?
[01:45:53.532 - 01:45:55.354] Guest: Bedroom guitarist.
[01:45:55.374 - 01:45:56.476] Guest: Give me the...
[01:45:56.496 - 01:45:57.737] Guest: Okay, it's in tune?
