[00:00:00.000 - 00:00:04.086] Guest: gave up everything to pursue my 19-year-old dream.
[00:00:04.747 - 00:00:06.850] Guest: My 19-year-old opportunity is that even.
[00:00:06.890 - 00:00:13.118] Host: When someone sees your life the way you speak about it, there's a lot of blessings at like a lot of points.
[00:00:13.599 - 00:00:14.260] Host: You believe in karma?
[00:00:14.661 - 00:00:15.181] Host: Absolutely.
[00:00:15.602 - 00:00:17.204] Host: You believe in reincarnation?
[00:00:17.424 - 00:00:17.685] Host: I do.
[00:00:17.845 - 00:00:20.469] Host: Do you think about what you did in your previous life to get this life now?
[00:00:20.629 - 00:00:21.110] Guest: I hope so.
[00:00:21.210 - 00:00:21.470] Guest: I do.
[00:00:21.911 - 00:00:30.002] Guest: And I always think about it like if you think, why do I have, why am I lucky enough to have the life that I do?
[00:00:30.210 - 00:00:41.647] Guest: and some other woman somewhere else with the same opportunity, with the same desires, same ambitions, same needs, doesn't have any of it.
[00:00:42.208 - 00:00:43.530] Guest: I really think about that a lot.
[00:00:44.391 - 00:00:47.015] Guest: It makes me feel like there must be something I did right.
[00:00:47.115 - 00:00:52.223] Guest: I wake up every day with a sense of gratitude and I wake up every day with wanting to give back.
[00:00:52.744 - 00:00:59.794] Guest: Whether that's with the person that is standing right next to me or whether that is a life choice that I might make,
[00:00:59.938 - 00:01:04.965] Guest: But giving back, I think, is so crucial when it comes to being grateful.
[00:01:05.306 - 00:01:07.389] Guest: I'm highly grateful for everything that I have.
[00:01:07.769 - 00:01:21.348] Guest: And I do think that maybe I did something right, that I've been blessed with the opportunity of having the life, being born to the parents that I was, being able to have the opportunity of making my own choices, having agency in my own life.
[00:01:21.409 - 00:01:25.234] Guest: If you think about women around the world, so many don't have that.
[00:01:25.474 - 00:01:27.396] Guest: Complete choices are made for themselves.
[00:01:27.896 - 00:01:30.419] Guest: But my parents told me, you have to have your opinion.
[00:01:31.200 - 00:01:32.020] Guest: What a privilege.
[00:01:34.343 - 00:01:36.765] Host: That's a part of the blessing, being born to those parents.
[00:01:37.146 - 00:01:38.147] Host: That's the biggest one probably.
[00:01:38.367 - 00:01:39.208] Guest: Yeah, completely.
[00:01:40.849 - 00:01:41.029] Host: Wow.
[00:01:41.810 - 00:01:42.651] Host: Okay, hold on.
[00:01:42.891 - 00:01:45.714] Host: I got to take my thoughts and just put them together.
[00:01:45.734 - 00:01:46.595] Guest: I made you speechless.
[00:01:46.715 - 00:01:49.197] Guest: No, no.
[00:01:49.878 - 00:01:50.118] Host: Okay.
[00:01:51.820 - 00:01:53.842] Host: With this whole journey,
[00:01:53.986 - 00:01:58.598] Host: And this is a question that's been sent in from a lot of people who I spoke to before this chat.
[00:02:00.463 - 00:02:04.994] Host: Firstly, I want to tell you that you inspire men, women, everyone.
