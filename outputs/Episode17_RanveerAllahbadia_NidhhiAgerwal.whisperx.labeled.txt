[00:00:39.060 - 00:00:42.725] Guest: I mean, people of Tamil Nadu will go for his film regardless of anything.

[00:00:55.443 - 00:01:00.990] Guest: At a very very very low phase of my life, I banged my head on the wall in Kashi.
[00:01:01.091 - 00:01:04.535] Guest: Literally my crown chakra and I don't know what happened but my life changed after that.
[00:01:05.016 - 00:01:05.336] Host: Oh wow!
[00:01:06.478 - 00:01:07.139] Host: Are you single now?

[00:01:27.786 - 00:01:28.908] Host: Has someone ever dumped you?
[00:01:29.008 - 00:01:31.592] Guest: I haven't been dumped but I have been cheated on.
[00:01:31.712 - 00:01:39.364] Guest: It was so difficult for me to understand because whoever I've dated before I never ever felt like okay I want to marry this person.
[00:01:39.484 - 00:01:40.626] Host: Was your partner famous?
[00:02:04.546 - 00:02:13.356] Host: A podcast is about to start with the angel of Telugu.
[00:02:13.376 - 00:02:17.140] Host: So, at the start, I just want to say that... Wow!
[00:02:18.301 - 00:02:22.646] Guest: I thought that I have to speak in Hindi and you speak in Telugu.
[00:02:22.926 - 00:02:24.588] Guest: By the way, your Telugu is very good.
[00:02:24.908 - 00:02:26.890] Guest: Thank you Ranveer for that introduction.
[00:02:27.091 - 00:02:29.513] Host: No, our pleasure having you here.
[00:02:29.673 - 00:02:31.375] Host: You have to say so much.
[00:02:31.395 - 00:02:32.256] Host: I am very pumped.

[00:02:40.511 - 00:02:44.656] Host: I think so am I. I'm meeting you for the first time in my life.
[00:02:44.676 - 00:02:46.499] Guest: Are you sure we're meeting for the first time?
[00:02:46.519 - 00:02:48.061] Guest: We've never bumped into each other.
[00:02:48.081 - 00:02:48.261] Guest: No, no.
[00:02:48.301 - 00:02:48.662] Guest: Oh great.
[00:02:48.722 - 00:02:49.603] Guest: Lovely to meet you.
[00:02:49.643 - 00:02:51.085] Host: Same.
[00:02:51.185 - 00:02:51.345] Host: Same.
[00:02:51.365 - 00:02:53.168] Host: And that's why I didn't let you talk to me.
[00:02:53.608 - 00:02:53.689] Unknown: Yes.
[00:02:53.709 - 00:02:54.950] Guest: Ranveer has a process.
[00:02:54.970 - 00:02:56.913] Guest: He's a method podcaster.
[00:02:57.173 - 00:02:57.514] Host: Yeah.
[00:02:57.634 - 00:02:58.335] Host: Yeah.
[00:02:58.355 - 00:03:00.658] Host: Because I feel that for genuine vibes,
[00:03:00.770 - 00:03:04.554] Host: podcast consume because the world has become lonely.
[00:03:04.574 - 00:03:05.274] Guest: People are lonely.
[00:03:05.735 - 00:03:06.676] Host: Are you lonely?
[00:03:07.016 - 00:03:08.317] Guest: Honestly, yes.
[00:03:08.337 - 00:03:17.386] Guest: I think we all feel a bit of loneliness and definitely I really feel like in the best and worst moments you are alone.
[00:03:18.006 - 00:03:20.408] Guest: So you just have to learn to deal with that.
[00:03:20.829 - 00:03:25.893] Guest: Because in the lowest of lows and in the highest of highs if you notice you are always alone.
[00:03:26.554 - 00:03:29.297] Guest: Because no one can feel that low or that high with you.
[00:03:29.317 - 00:03:30.738] Guest: They can feel a certain level of
[00:03:30.882 - 00:03:33.607] Guest: emotion with you, but no one can really feel what you're feeling.
[00:03:34.188 - 00:03:36.672] Guest: You know, when you're very low or very high as well.
[00:03:37.353 - 00:03:38.515] Host: Hmm, when you're very high as well.
[00:03:38.696 - 00:03:39.036] Guest: Yeah.
[00:03:39.677 - 00:03:44.025] Guest: I mean see, jaise hum actors ka kya hota hai na Ranveer, and I've noticed this, so my film has just released.
[00:03:44.305 - 00:03:48.953] Guest: I'm just telling you the feeling ki, you feel very, bahut adrenaline feel hota hai.
[00:03:49.514 - 00:03:55.384] Guest: Bahut ek, you know, every stage you go to, people are screaming for you, they're cheering, you know, for you.
[00:03:55.545 - 00:03:56.306] Guest: People are like,
[00:03:56.866 - 00:04:20.562] Guest: loving to give you attention at that point of time because you have a release coming up so that point up until the release is a very high in your mind you know and then with the release you sort of come back to normal and then if it's good it maintains if it's bad the result then you go lower so it's the lows and highs I feel especially as a public person but especially as an actor because
[00:04:21.250 - 00:04:23.233] Guest: The world is open.
[00:04:23.393 - 00:04:27.258] Guest: Everyone has a voice.
[00:04:27.278 - 00:04:28.300] Guest: Everyone has an account.
[00:04:28.320 - 00:04:31.124] Host: Everyone has 10 accounts.
[00:04:31.144 - 00:04:33.387] Host: And it's the time of PR.
[00:04:33.407 - 00:04:34.528] Host: The time of PR games.
[00:04:34.548 - 00:04:36.831] Host: We should talk about it.
[00:04:37.392 - 00:04:40.476] Guest: I would love to because we should talk about it.
[00:04:40.657 - 00:04:43.581] Host: Since the world has learned the word PR, the world has not learned to shut up.
[00:04:44.322 - 00:04:45.643] Guest: I completely agree with you.
[00:04:45.884 - 00:04:47.506] Guest: And I really feel like
[00:04:47.746 - 00:04:49.989] Guest: People's opinions have always been there.
[00:04:50.009 - 00:04:51.131] Guest: It's just that you don't know them.
[00:04:51.291 - 00:04:54.536] Guest: Now everyone has access to tell you what they feel.
[00:04:54.576 - 00:04:57.080] Guest: And everyone has conflicting opinions.
[00:04:57.841 - 00:05:03.069] Guest: So it's extremely confusing as to what to listen to and what to not listen to.
[00:05:03.109 - 00:05:04.631] Guest: So opinions are great.
[00:05:05.432 - 00:05:06.234] Guest: But you know.
[00:05:07.315 - 00:05:11.221] Host: You know, I feel that there are three levels of PR.
[00:05:11.241 - 00:05:14.546] Host: One level is what we have learnt in the last 10 years.
[00:05:14.658 - 00:05:18.364] Host: PR is an associated skill from the media career.
[00:05:18.584 - 00:05:21.929] Host: For whatever reason, the world has now understood this PR skill.
[00:05:21.969 - 00:05:26.776] Host: So when you go on Reddit, everyone is discussing PR games.
[00:05:28.058 - 00:05:29.941] Guest: Reddit is a new world for me guys.
[00:05:30.001 - 00:05:32.305] Guest: I recently discovered Reddit.
[00:05:32.605 - 00:05:34.829] Guest: It's maybe worse than Twitter.
[00:05:34.849 - 00:05:38.815] Host: Yeah, because identity is completely hidden.
[00:05:38.975 - 00:05:40.037] Guest: So people can say anything.
[00:05:40.277 - 00:05:40.978] Guest: And I think
[00:05:41.122 - 00:05:44.148] Guest: There are certain people who are on Reddit also with other names.
[00:05:45.010 - 00:05:47.575] Guest: But yeah, people are people.
[00:05:47.595 - 00:05:49.017] Host: By the way, we have a Gen Z with us.
[00:05:49.218 - 00:05:52.945] Host: Rohan, any quick Gen Z opinions on Reddit and PR?
[00:05:52.965 - 00:05:54.207] Guest: I would love to know.
[00:05:54.227 - 00:06:00.219] Unknown: Yeah, so people are very aware about if the PR is happening or not.
[00:06:00.239 - 00:06:03.826] Unknown: I mean, if any PR campaigns come nowadays, Bollywood or any movie.
[00:06:04.098 - 00:06:08.005] Unknown: So people guessed it in such a way that it didn't happen before 10 years ago.
[00:06:08.025 - 00:06:13.073] Unknown: But now people are very easy to guess that this is a PR campaign and this is a natural campaign.
[00:06:13.093 - 00:06:17.420] Unknown: And recently there have been a lot of campaigns in which people can guess quickly.
[00:06:17.781 - 00:06:19.323] Guest: But in a way I feel that's a good thing.
[00:06:19.444 - 00:06:22.709] Guest: If people are able to catch that this is not genuine, this is PR.
[00:06:22.829 - 00:06:24.853] Guest: I actually feel that's nice.
[00:06:24.873 - 00:06:25.714] Host: I hope.
[00:06:25.858 - 00:06:27.420] Host: I hope people are able to catch it.
[00:06:27.940 - 00:06:30.744] Host: See, I think people are able to catch positive PR very easily.
[00:06:30.764 - 00:06:32.526] Host: That they got PR done.
[00:06:32.826 - 00:06:36.070] Host: But when someone gets negative PR on mass care.
[00:06:36.290 - 00:06:38.652] Host: I think our world thinks that it is fabricated.
[00:06:38.813 - 00:06:40.795] Host: Because we are media professionals.
[00:06:40.975 - 00:06:43.258] Host: But the audience thinks that it is genuinely negative.
[00:06:43.358 - 00:06:46.581] Guest: No, but you know something, so much negative PR happens.
[00:06:46.621 - 00:06:48.263] Guest: There are so many attacks that happen.
[00:06:48.684 - 00:06:51.066] Guest: Even something like Book My Show rating.
[00:06:51.587 - 00:06:52.668] Guest: IMDB rating.
[00:06:53.189 - 00:06:54.290] Guest: On Twitter.
[00:06:54.498 - 00:06:58.302] Guest: with the media, you know, there is a certain section of paid reviews.
[00:06:58.863 - 00:07:03.228] Guest: So there is a lot of negativity and people spend a lot of money to pull people down.
[00:07:03.408 - 00:07:07.773] Guest: I feel sometimes people spend more money to pull people down than lift themselves up.
[00:07:07.833 - 00:07:12.038] Guest: Recently, I also had some negative campaign that started.
[00:07:12.278 - 00:07:14.381] Host: Now just tell us the name.
[00:07:14.821 - 00:07:22.450] Guest: But we stopped it immediately because I was just like, dude, I am going to push myself in a good way but if you do something negative then
[00:07:23.074 - 00:07:25.637] Guest: I'm going to do it right back.
[00:07:25.657 - 00:07:27.339] Host: I won't take names.
[00:07:27.359 - 00:07:41.476] Host: A very famous and powerful person, it's a billionaire from a legacy billionaire family, he said that 10-20 years ago he learned that learning self-defense from a PR perspective is very important in our world.
[00:07:41.496 - 00:07:42.938] Host: Don't attack anyone else.
[00:07:43.178 - 00:07:44.019] Guest: I agree with you.
[00:07:44.039 - 00:07:45.201] Guest: Do good for yourself.
[00:07:45.401 - 00:07:45.761] Guest: Great.
[00:07:45.781 - 00:07:46.322] Guest: But don't
[00:07:46.594 - 00:07:48.317] Guest: You know, do something negative for someone else.
[00:07:48.377 - 00:07:49.840] Guest: That's again your intention.
[00:07:49.880 - 00:07:51.763] Host: That's your karma.
[00:07:51.783 - 00:07:52.725] Host: Your own negative karma.
[00:07:52.745 - 00:07:53.867] Guest: I really feel that.
[00:07:54.347 - 00:07:54.468] Guest: Right?
[00:07:54.648 - 00:07:55.950] Host: But this is what you and I are saying.
[00:07:56.231 - 00:07:59.977] Host: And you know, I have generally seen that there are two types of people in the media.
[00:07:59.997 - 00:08:04.525] Host: Here, it's like... Why did you do this?
[00:08:04.545 - 00:08:04.765] Host: Money.
[00:08:04.786 - 00:08:04.906] Host: Money?
[00:08:05.146 - 00:08:08.071] Host: I am talking about the hearts.
[00:08:08.091 - 00:08:08.372] Host: You tell me.
[00:08:08.392 - 00:08:09.714] Guest: No, but eventually, I mean...
[00:08:10.114 - 00:08:22.532] Guest: Yeah, unfortunately, I actually feel like media is very powerful, very very powerful and people don't understand this but the industry and media are all in the same boat.
[00:08:23.093 - 00:08:28.461] Guest: If you make holes in the same boat, then eventually it's everyone's loss.
[00:08:28.481 - 00:08:34.049] Host: From outside, Telugu film industry looks very simple, clean and work-oriented.
[00:08:34.069 - 00:08:35.211] Host: Am I right in saying that?
[00:08:35.231 - 00:08:37.034] Guest: Yeah, I think you are 70% right.
[00:08:37.234 - 00:08:40.018] Guest: I think when it comes to actors, directors,
[00:08:40.162 - 00:08:46.290] Guest: filmmaking, production, I feel there's a lot of sincerity, there's a lot of passion.
[00:08:47.111 - 00:08:54.041] Guest: There's a lot of love, there's a lot of rootedness in cinema and they really love shooting.
[00:08:54.061 - 00:08:59.989] Guest: I mean, if you just go on shooting, nobody is really bothered that this is my job, I'm just going to do this.
[00:09:00.610 - 00:09:04.095] Guest: Everybody is involved in the process and everyone wants to do their best.
[00:09:04.655 - 00:09:09.522] Guest: So it's a very homely, chilled out, yet very productive environment.
[00:09:09.858 - 00:09:14.705] Guest: But I feel like, yeah, there's just a certain section of, again, this paid media.
[00:09:14.725 - 00:09:16.988] Guest: But there are genuine people as well, but very few.
[00:09:17.188 - 00:09:20.633] Host: Yeah, like, I was saying that I feel there are two types of media professionals.
[00:09:20.653 - 00:09:24.578] Host: One, whose inner child is alive, who chose this career for art.
[00:09:24.598 - 00:09:28.183] Guest: I am so surprised you spoke about inner child because I've been working on that a lot.
[00:09:29.025 - 00:09:34.672] Host: And the other section which is over-competitive, and that is a glimpse of their own insecurities.
[00:09:34.692 - 00:09:35.534] Host: Absolutely.
[00:09:35.554 - 00:09:37.817] Host: They do this mass-scale negative PR.
[00:09:38.658 - 00:09:38.738] Unknown: Yes.
[00:09:39.746 - 00:09:45.156] Host: Shout out to Kartik Aryan, shout out to Varun Dhawan, shout out to Rohan.
[00:09:45.938 - 00:09:47.340] Unknown: These two are people.
[00:09:47.461 - 00:09:55.616] Unknown: I have seen a lot of videos also that a lot of influencers are getting mails, they are being paid to post negative about them.
[00:09:55.636 - 00:09:56.137] Guest: Oh really?
[00:09:56.237 - 00:09:58.381] Guest: Yeah, this has become a new... That's really bad.
[00:09:58.521 - 00:10:00.946] Host: Yeah, so I was sitting with my mom yesterday.
[00:10:01.218 - 00:10:05.144] Host: And I asked him, have you heard anything about Kartik Aryan lately?
[00:10:05.684 - 00:10:08.529] Host: And he said, I know there was some controversy.
[00:10:08.569 - 00:10:10.111] Host: This has reached him.
[00:10:10.311 - 00:10:13.796] Host: He doesn't know what kind of PR mechanism is behind this.
[00:10:13.816 - 00:10:17.281] Guest: But people spend a lot of money on this.
[00:10:17.301 - 00:10:17.582] Guest: A lot.
[00:10:17.682 - 00:10:21.367] Guest: And it's so horrible, I feel, because leave all this.
[00:10:21.447 - 00:10:23.991] Guest: Leave the money, leave what people think.
[00:10:24.031 - 00:10:26.034] Guest: But that particular person,
[00:10:26.178 - 00:10:28.541] Guest: And actors are very, very sensitive.
[00:10:28.701 - 00:10:29.562] Guest: They are very emotional.
[00:10:29.582 - 00:10:32.025] Guest: They are very childlike from the inside.
[00:10:32.645 - 00:10:36.330] Guest: So, I feel like for their mental health, it's really not good.
[00:10:37.151 - 00:10:38.532] Guest: You know, you feel attacked.
[00:10:38.552 - 00:10:44.619] Host: The counter argument is that if you have chosen a career of fame, then you should endure the bad mental health.
[00:10:44.639 - 00:10:47.443] Guest: Yes, but public personality, public property is not there.
[00:10:47.463 - 00:10:50.386] Guest: There is a slight difference in this.
[00:10:50.786 - 00:10:52.931] Host: They are talking about your humanity.
[00:10:53.151 - 00:10:54.775] Host: But everyone doesn't have humanity.
[00:10:55.055 - 00:10:59.284] Guest: And what happens is, when we go home, we also have parents.
[00:10:59.485 - 00:11:01.028] Guest: You know, you are answerable to your parents.
[00:11:01.048 - 00:11:02.612] Guest: You are answerable to your family.
[00:11:03.153 - 00:11:04.776] Guest: They have their circle of friends.
[00:11:04.917 - 00:11:09.106] Guest: It's not nice, I feel.
[00:11:09.567 - 00:11:11.090] Host: Honestly, from the bottom of my heart,
[00:11:11.682 - 00:11:14.525] Host: These two brothers seem very bad to me.
[00:11:14.545 - 00:11:16.447] Host: The guys we named Karthik and Varun Dhawan.
[00:11:16.467 - 00:11:17.868] Guest: And they are very genuine people.
[00:11:17.888 - 00:11:19.830] Guest: So I know both of them a little bit.
[00:11:19.951 - 00:11:20.952] Guest: I don't know them too well.
[00:11:21.472 - 00:11:23.895] Guest: And Varun is a very childlike person.
[00:11:23.935 - 00:11:25.356] Guest: Very sweet, very encouraging.
[00:11:25.436 - 00:11:27.739] Guest: I mean, he encourages newcomers a lot.
[00:11:28.139 - 00:11:30.081] Guest: And even Karthik, I think, has worked very hard.
[00:11:30.682 - 00:11:31.903] Guest: You know, to get to where he is.
[00:11:31.963 - 00:11:34.185] Guest: So, why?
[00:11:34.966 - 00:11:36.267] Host: Yeah.
[00:11:36.287 - 00:11:37.709] Host: I have a lot to say.
[00:11:37.749 - 00:11:38.770] Host: Yes, please.
[00:11:38.978 - 00:11:42.222] Host: And one of those things is kind of related to Varun Dhawan also.
[00:11:42.463 - 00:11:44.005] Host: Okay.
[00:11:44.025 - 00:11:44.245] Host: Okay.
[00:11:44.265 - 00:11:46.528] Host: I feel very good sitting in front of you.
[00:11:46.548 - 00:11:47.269] Host: Because of your energy.
[00:11:47.690 - 00:11:48.771] Host: No, it's great energy.
[00:11:49.192 - 00:11:50.333] Host: You have very nice energy.
[00:11:50.354 - 00:11:50.594] Guest: Thank you.
[00:11:50.794 - 00:11:51.956] Guest: I've done my healing today.
[00:11:51.996 - 00:11:53.518] Guest: So I think maybe that's reflecting.
[00:11:53.818 - 00:11:56.181] Host: I feel very peaceful around you.
[00:11:56.201 - 00:11:57.603] Guest: But I'll tell you something Ranveer.
[00:11:57.844 - 00:11:59.286] Guest: Every single person tells me this.
[00:11:59.326 - 00:12:01.569] Guest: So I'm into a lot of reiki.
[00:12:01.769 - 00:12:04.593] Guest: I do a lot of meditation.
[00:12:04.893 - 00:12:08.338] Guest: And I feel I'm very spiritually connected.
[00:12:11.266 - 00:12:19.459] Guest: You know, I mean, it's just one of the things, but this is the most important and strongest relationship, I think, in my life.
[00:12:20.060 - 00:12:22.063] Guest: And this is what every person tells me.
[00:12:22.564 - 00:12:23.886] Guest: Calm, positive.
[00:12:24.107 - 00:12:25.269] Guest: Calm, positive, sweet.
[00:12:25.289 - 00:12:27.052] Guest: I want to get rid of the sweet.
[00:12:27.172 - 00:12:31.058] Guest: I want to become a bit more, you know, just...
[00:12:31.170 - 00:12:33.574] Guest: Yes, I am tired of being sweet now.
[00:12:34.435 - 00:12:36.178] Guest: But yeah, calm and positive.
[00:12:36.198 - 00:12:37.600] Guest: These two things I get the most.
[00:12:37.620 - 00:12:42.488] Host: Actually, I was going to ask you about your hair care routine and skin care routine.
[00:12:42.508 - 00:12:43.589] Host: But you answered it.
[00:12:44.050 - 00:12:45.893] Host: You do Reiki healing.
[00:12:45.993 - 00:12:47.255] Guest: I do it everyday.
[00:12:47.395 - 00:12:51.682] Host: Those people who haven't met Reiki healers yet and those who haven't experienced Reiki.
[00:12:52.223 - 00:12:56.509] Host: You don't know what it's like being around a Reiki practitioner.
[00:12:56.529 - 00:12:57.010] Host: There is aura.
[00:12:57.218 - 00:12:59.120] Guest: Yeah, I completely agree with you.
[00:12:59.160 - 00:13:05.366] Guest: In fact, I started Reiki at a very, very, very low phase of my life.
[00:13:05.386 - 00:13:06.627] Guest: Personally, not professionally.
[00:13:06.667 - 00:13:09.830] Guest: Professionally, everything was very high at that point of time.
[00:13:10.611 - 00:13:10.951] Guest: 2016?
[00:13:10.971 - 00:13:11.432] Guest: No, 2016.
[00:13:11.472 - 00:13:12.473] Guest: No, very recently.
[00:13:13.253 - 00:13:13.594] Guest: Okay.
[00:13:13.714 - 00:13:22.722] Guest: In 2018, I think after I went to Kashi, spiritually, I banged my head on the wall by literally my crown chakra.
[00:13:22.822 - 00:13:26.546] Guest: And I don't know what happened, but my life changed after that in Kashi.
[00:13:26.658 - 00:13:33.985] Guest: So that was something that really opened up the world of spirituality, God, self-connection and introspection, all of that.
[00:13:34.525 - 00:13:34.986] Guest: Magic.
[00:13:35.646 - 00:13:36.687] Guest: You know, all of these things.
[00:13:37.288 - 00:13:40.671] Guest: So that happened, but reiki is a very recent thing in my life.
[00:13:41.312 - 00:13:47.478] Guest: And in a very personally low phase, I didn't have an option but to just work on myself.
[00:13:47.518 - 00:13:52.662] Guest: You know, work on my inner child and work on feeling positive, being positive.
[00:13:53.103 - 00:13:55.845] Guest: And I'm the kind of person who doesn't give up.
[00:13:55.865 - 00:13:56.466] Guest: If my...
[00:13:56.706 - 00:13:59.270] Guest: I know that okay, I'm feeling this way, I will solve it.
[00:14:00.051 - 00:14:07.323] Guest: I will do whatever it takes to make myself feel better, to make myself feel happy, to bring my own vibration up.
[00:14:07.403 - 00:14:09.747] Guest: I will not accept defeat ever in life.
[00:14:12.331 - 00:14:16.357] Guest: But really, I mean, it takes a lot of energy, I think, to do that.
[00:14:17.058 - 00:14:19.502] Guest: But I do it and I constantly do it.
[00:14:20.504 - 00:14:22.507] Host: We started with Telugu.
[00:14:22.587 - 00:14:24.189] Guest: Yes, and you spoke very good Telugu.
[00:14:24.210 - 00:14:24.530] Guest: Thank you.
[00:14:25.346 - 00:14:29.231] Host: Actually, I wanted to thank you for reaching out.
[00:14:30.893 - 00:14:34.959] Host: Just when I had gotten back into my house last year.
[00:14:34.979 - 00:14:37.943] Host: Whatever happened last year, I was frazzled.
[00:14:38.063 - 00:14:43.270] Guest: I was just sitting at home and I wasn't even leaving the house.
[00:14:43.290 - 00:14:45.553] Host: I didn't leave the house for a month or two.
[00:14:45.573 - 00:14:48.437] Host: I kept all my workout gear at home.
[00:14:48.457 - 00:14:50.280] Host: I was just in my apartment.
[00:14:50.880 - 00:14:53.384] Host: And very few celebs reached out.
[00:14:53.564 - 00:14:55.026] Host: Over time, lots reached out.
[00:14:55.138 - 00:14:58.482] Host: But you were maybe the first or second person who reached out when I came back home.
[00:14:59.323 - 00:15:03.008] Host: And you just said, you know, just believe in the future.
[00:15:03.549 - 00:15:05.972] Host: So thank you for the digital healing.
[00:15:06.313 - 00:15:07.214] Guest: Thank you Ranveer.
[00:15:07.374 - 00:15:11.159] Guest: And no, about Ranveer, about you, I have to say that I have been...
[00:15:11.179 - 00:15:15.785] Guest: I have been watching your podcast for many years because I feel like you are so genuine.
[00:15:15.825 - 00:15:20.411] Guest: And you talk about topics that people don't dare to.
[00:15:20.431 - 00:15:22.674] Guest: You know, you have in a way encouraged
[00:15:22.946 - 00:15:28.313] Guest: a whole generation to kind of be spiritual, to believe in, to make those kind of things cool again.
[00:15:28.373 - 00:15:31.516] Guest: You know, and I feel like that's really, really important.
[00:15:31.677 - 00:15:32.277] Guest: Thank you.
[00:15:32.297 - 00:15:37.203] Guest: So what you are doing, because of one thing, you can't negate that.
[00:15:37.664 - 00:15:40.147] Guest: I mean, what you've done is a million times more.
[00:15:40.828 - 00:15:46.034] Guest: You know, everyone makes mistakes, but it's your intention and your heart is, you have a beautiful heart.
[00:15:46.054 - 00:15:46.395] Host: Thank you.
[00:15:46.415 - 00:15:48.016] Guest: So you should be loved for that.
[00:15:48.137 - 00:15:48.577] Host: Thank you.
[00:15:48.597 - 00:15:49.418] Host: Thank you so much.
[00:15:50.059 - 00:15:50.980] Host: Takes one to know one.
[00:15:51.361 - 00:15:52.562] Guest: Thank you.
[00:15:52.770 - 00:16:00.120] Host: What I definitely will say is, I felt a lot of empathy from that message.
[00:16:00.801 - 00:16:03.966] Host: I don't want to get into details of that because that's private life.
[00:16:04.487 - 00:16:06.409] Host: But you showed a lot of empathy.
[00:16:06.970 - 00:16:10.014] Host: And I actually got emotional after reading that.
[00:16:10.034 - 00:16:12.658] Host: Here's another media celebrity.
[00:16:12.834 - 00:16:16.418] Host: professional who understands the trials and is reaching out with empathy.
[00:16:16.438 - 00:16:16.839] Host: Thank you.
[00:16:16.859 - 00:16:18.541] Host: Thank you that you just understood my predicament.
[00:16:18.561 - 00:16:18.942] Guest: Yeah.
[00:16:18.962 - 00:16:19.622] Guest: Yeah.
[00:16:19.763 - 00:16:22.406] Guest: I can't even imagine what that phase would have been like for you.
[00:16:22.526 - 00:16:23.147] Guest: But you know what?
[00:16:23.788 - 00:16:25.670] Guest: I think I have seen it after that.
[00:16:26.911 - 00:16:30.135] Guest: There are certain times in life where you just have to learn a lot of lessons.
[00:16:30.656 - 00:16:33.239] Guest: You know, you have to balance out certain karmas in life.
[00:16:33.259 - 00:16:35.382] Guest: And it was just one of those things.
[00:16:35.422 - 00:16:38.025] Guest: And you've come out bigger, better, stronger.
[00:16:38.045 - 00:16:41.970] Guest: Or I think people have seen that something like that can't phase you out.
[00:16:42.338 - 00:16:44.361] Guest: because of all the good that you've done.
[00:16:44.401 - 00:16:45.163] Guest: Thank you.
[00:16:45.644 - 00:16:47.086] Guest: Your plus bank is very big.
[00:16:47.687 - 00:16:48.108] Host: Thank you.
[00:16:48.168 - 00:16:49.310] Host: Thank you.
[00:16:49.330 - 00:16:51.173] Host: I want to discuss a lot with you.
[00:16:51.413 - 00:16:51.934] Host: Genuinely.
[00:16:52.896 - 00:16:55.961] Host: Where should we start?
[00:16:55.981 - 00:17:00.268] Host: Can I recommend one possible starting point?
[00:17:00.369 - 00:17:01.671] Guest: Where should we start?
[00:17:01.691 - 00:17:03.033] Host: Hair care, routine, skin care?
[00:17:03.053 - 00:17:03.113] Unknown: No.
[00:17:03.133 - 00:17:03.634] Host: I wouldn't mind.
[00:17:04.034 - 00:17:05.175] Host: What is your hair care routine?
[00:17:05.636 - 00:17:07.338] Guest: Honestly, my hair care routine is nothing.
[00:17:07.839 - 00:17:10.121] Guest: I do coconut oiling sometimes.
[00:17:10.141 - 00:17:13.465] Guest: Because my hair normally is very straight and very flat.
[00:17:13.826 - 00:17:16.149] Guest: So the flat thing is my problem.
[00:17:16.589 - 00:17:18.832] Guest: But I think hair is one thing genetically.
[00:17:18.892 - 00:17:20.714] Guest: My mother has better hair than me.
[00:17:20.894 - 00:17:21.275] Guest: Oh really?
[00:17:21.475 - 00:17:22.316] Guest: So does my sister.
[00:17:22.336 - 00:17:23.477] Guest: What is better than this?
[00:17:23.497 - 00:17:24.659] Guest: Yes, so does my sister.
[00:17:24.679 - 00:17:27.282] Guest: I mean, my styling has become a bit...
[00:17:27.650 - 00:17:33.658] Guest: different but in school I remember seniors used to come and touch my hair and be like oh my god your hair is so soft.
[00:17:34.039 - 00:17:36.121] Guest: So I think hair is just minimum care.
[00:17:36.282 - 00:17:38.464] Guest: I don't believe in hair spas, masks.
[00:17:39.225 - 00:17:40.507] Guest: I'm very old school like that.
[00:17:40.747 - 00:17:43.591] Host: Honestly even your voice is healing listeners.
[00:17:43.611 - 00:17:44.212] Host: Thank you.
[00:17:44.232 - 00:17:50.861] Host: I feel that something is happening inside you because of which skincare, hair care, voice care routine is taking care of itself.
[00:17:50.901 - 00:17:56.088] Guest: Yeah Ranveer, I just feel like only one thing is most important in life that is intention.
[00:17:56.488 - 00:17:57.650] Guest: What is your intention?
[00:17:58.370 - 00:18:00.052] Guest: You know, I'm an actor.
[00:18:00.232 - 00:18:00.873] Guest: Why am I an actor?
[00:18:00.893 - 00:18:02.055] Guest: Why am I working?
[00:18:02.335 - 00:18:03.016] Guest: Is it for the money?
[00:18:03.136 - 00:18:03.857] Guest: Is it for the fame?
[00:18:03.877 - 00:18:05.479] Guest: And I've asked myself these questions.
[00:18:05.519 - 00:18:06.420] Guest: I've journaled it out.
[00:18:06.881 - 00:18:07.622] Guest: And it's not that.
[00:18:08.042 - 00:18:13.249] Guest: Even if I got paid nothing, even if I got no fame with this profession, I would still love to do it.
[00:18:13.710 - 00:18:19.177] Guest: Because the child, there is this child inside me that was just obsessed with becoming an actress.
[00:18:19.717 - 00:18:23.202] Guest: Not knowing the perks or the negative things that come with it.
[00:18:23.843 - 00:18:24.644] Guest: But intention.
[00:18:26.146 - 00:18:26.386] Host: Hmm.
[00:18:26.626 - 00:18:27.827] Guest: Always go to intention.
[00:18:28.028 - 00:18:30.250] Host: What's going on inside?
[00:18:30.270 - 00:18:35.316] Guest: My film has just been released, Raja Saab, with Prabhas sir.
[00:18:35.716 - 00:18:36.618] Guest: And it's doing very well.
[00:18:36.798 - 00:18:37.739] Guest: Our opening...
[00:18:37.759 - 00:18:38.560] Guest: I'm going to talk numbers.
[00:18:38.700 - 00:18:39.421] Guest: I hope that's okay.
[00:18:39.461 - 00:18:40.122] Guest: Go for it, go for it.
[00:18:40.182 - 00:18:41.163] Guest: But why not, right?
[00:18:41.763 - 00:18:44.467] Guest: So, our opening was 112, close.
[00:18:44.607 - 00:18:45.328] Guest: That is day one.
[00:18:45.848 - 00:18:47.330] Guest: When premieres and all were cancelled.
[00:18:47.350 - 00:18:50.574] Guest: But still, you know, he got those figures.
[00:18:51.535 - 00:18:53.417] Guest: And the film is in the theaters.
[00:18:53.477 - 00:18:54.418] Guest: It's doing great.
[00:18:54.690 - 00:18:56.592] Guest: Weekend number will be 200 plus.
[00:18:57.113 - 00:18:59.335] Guest: So I'm feeling really happy, I'm feeling grateful.
[00:18:59.395 - 00:19:05.122] Guest: But somewhere what happens is when a movie is released, that whole day is like a roller coaster.
[00:19:06.504 - 00:19:12.931] Guest: Because every review you see, every tweet you see, every Instagram thing you see, somewhere it affects you and you get confused.
[00:19:13.672 - 00:19:18.057] Guest: That he is saying that it's very good, he is saying that it's okay, he is saying that it's very useless.
[00:19:18.077 - 00:19:19.339] Guest: I mean what is it?
[00:19:19.359 - 00:19:22.162] Guest: So I feel again, you have to just go back to your intention.
[00:19:22.402 - 00:19:25.026] Guest: You have to go back to yourself that I wanted to do this.
[00:19:25.046 - 00:19:25.948] Guest: I liked it.
[00:19:25.968 - 00:19:27.470] Guest: After that, it's up to people what they think.
[00:19:27.490 - 00:19:30.234] Guest: And you have to disconnect a bit, which I'm learning to do.
[00:19:30.855 - 00:19:33.359] Guest: But for that, I'll have to delete Twitter.
[00:19:34.000 - 00:19:35.343] Guest: Which I really thought of this.
[00:19:35.663 - 00:19:38.047] Guest: I thought of tweeting, you guys don't deserve me.
[00:19:38.648 - 00:19:40.871] Guest: And leaving Twitter.
[00:19:40.891 - 00:19:42.734] Guest: But I feel that sometimes.
[00:19:42.875 - 00:19:47.602] Guest: I feel like they don't deserve someone genuine who's
[00:19:47.906 - 00:19:48.847] Guest: not faking it.
[00:19:48.967 - 00:19:51.330] Guest: And I don't believe in the saying of fake it till you make it.
[00:19:52.891 - 00:19:53.472] Guest: I don't believe.
[00:19:53.572 - 00:19:55.855] Guest: I feel you can't fake it till you make it.
[00:19:56.355 - 00:19:58.077] Host: You know, I agree.
[00:19:58.137 - 00:20:01.481] Host: You can't fake it till you make it.
[00:20:01.501 - 00:20:02.782] Host: But back to paid PR.
[00:20:03.003 - 00:20:04.484] Host: There are so many fake projections.
[00:20:04.564 - 00:20:06.466] Guest: So many.
[00:20:06.486 - 00:20:06.887] Guest: So many.
[00:20:07.287 - 00:20:10.190] Host: Even in the world of YouTube, people buy subscribers.
[00:20:10.371 - 00:20:12.253] Guest: Listen, absolutely.
[00:20:12.333 - 00:20:13.614] Guest: Views, comments.
[00:20:15.576 - 00:20:16.117] Guest: Everything.
[00:20:16.617 - 00:20:17.138] Host: Yeah.
[00:20:17.346 - 00:20:21.792] Host: Internally, we've been running this for 10 years.
[00:20:21.952 - 00:20:24.936] Host: We had an internal call that we will never buy followers or subscribe.
[00:20:24.956 - 00:20:25.617] Host: You don't need to.
[00:20:26.858 - 00:20:30.483] Host: Yes, but then you see the whole industry doing it.
[00:20:30.503 - 00:20:34.368] Host: And then you just question is it true that good guys finish last?
[00:20:35.349 - 00:20:39.595] Guest: Tanveer, this is my biggest existential crisis in life.
[00:20:40.256 - 00:20:42.018] Guest: Do good things happen to good people?
[00:20:42.098 - 00:20:43.480] Guest: Tell me the answer to this today.
[00:20:44.001 - 00:20:45.042] Host: I guess...
[00:20:45.122 - 00:20:48.285] Host: Your intentions can only be seen by God.
[00:20:48.305 - 00:20:50.928] Host: I completely agree with you.
[00:20:50.948 - 00:20:53.411] Host: And there's a very famous quote, I can't remember who said this.
[00:20:54.472 - 00:21:03.202] Host: But it goes like, if you try saying the truth, people will call you Mufat, but you must say the truth anyway.
[00:21:03.642 - 00:21:10.590] Host: If you feel like you've done wrong and apologize, people will blame you for the apology, but you must apologize anyway.
[00:21:10.610 - 00:21:14.354] Host: Because in the end, it's not between you and people, it's between you and God anyway.
[00:21:14.562 - 00:21:16.024] Guest: And this is something I live by.
[00:21:16.244 - 00:21:18.327] Guest: Everything I believe is between you and God.
[00:21:18.347 - 00:21:20.911] Guest: Which is why you don't need to explain anything to anyone.
[00:21:21.191 - 00:21:23.714] Host: Yeah, I think there is something called divine justice.
[00:21:25.076 - 00:21:27.840] Host: Attached to the PR conversation.
[00:21:27.920 - 00:21:29.763] Host: Even little things like...
[00:21:29.903 - 00:21:34.850] Host: I think that if a person is on Reddit or Twitter all the time...
[00:21:34.870 - 00:21:35.330] Host: He will go crazy.
[00:21:35.871 - 00:21:38.254] Host: If he is spreading acid, that is also karma.
[00:21:38.615 - 00:21:39.876] Host: All that is also going to come back to their lives.
[00:21:39.936 - 00:21:41.138] Guest: But it is karma, so...
[00:21:41.602 - 00:21:44.487] Guest: Watch out, all of you who are doing this, it will hit you.
[00:21:44.507 - 00:21:45.188] Guest: But it will.
[00:21:45.649 - 00:21:49.214] Guest: Because you are literally... And you know what Ranveer, people don't understand this.
[00:21:49.435 - 00:21:50.697] Guest: Now there is a producer.
[00:21:51.679 - 00:21:55.345] Guest: They don't understand that many producers have lost all their money.
[00:21:55.805 - 00:21:59.371] Guest: Literally come on the streets because they have invested their house and everything.
[00:21:59.411 - 00:22:00.333] Guest: So they literally come on.
[00:22:00.874 - 00:22:02.456] Guest: So you are playing with people's careers.
[00:22:02.556 - 00:22:03.899] Guest: You are playing with their livelihoods.
[00:22:03.939 - 00:22:05.101] Guest: You are playing with their income.
[00:22:05.581 - 00:22:06.823] Guest: You are playing with their family.
[00:22:07.004 - 00:22:08.466] Guest: You are playing with their mental health.
[00:22:08.962 - 00:22:11.606] Guest: So, and every person is responsible for that.
[00:22:12.427 - 00:22:14.549] Host: Have you said anything about imperfection?
[00:22:14.570 - 00:22:14.970] Host: There are many.
[00:22:15.671 - 00:22:18.875] Host: I feel like you are a very sorted out person.
[00:22:19.376 - 00:22:21.459] Guest: I am sorted out from outside.
[00:22:22.120 - 00:22:33.194] Guest: I feel my biggest imperfection is that I have become incapable of putting out my mood.
[00:22:33.214 - 00:22:35.858] Guest: I mean, suppose I am upset.
[00:22:36.162 - 00:22:40.129] Guest: or I am angry or I am irritated or something has disturbed me.
[00:22:40.570 - 00:22:42.813] Guest: I have become incapable of expressing that.
[00:22:44.196 - 00:22:49.825] Guest: It's just become in my head, it's become like this thing of someone did this, okay.
[00:22:50.447 - 00:22:52.129] Guest: It's gone to like lessons.
[00:22:53.412 - 00:22:57.138] Guest: It's just gone to that.
[00:22:57.538 - 00:23:03.686] Guest: It's good for others, but it's not good for me, you know, because it just keeps getting piled up and I don't know when it'll burst.
[00:23:03.766 - 00:23:07.191] Guest: I know at some point it will, which is why I journal to just get it out.
[00:23:07.271 - 00:23:13.400] Guest: But you know what the trickiest part is, even when I'm journaling, I am still ending the statement with a positive line.
[00:23:13.680 - 00:23:19.828] Guest: And I'm like, why am I not able to write what I'm feeling even to myself, even when I know no one's going to read it?
[00:23:20.649 - 00:23:24.114] Guest: You know, have I become so private?
[00:23:24.450 - 00:23:26.412] Guest: private or ultra positive.
[00:23:26.432 - 00:23:29.034] Guest: We are not able to accept that something is affecting me.
[00:23:29.675 - 00:23:32.057] Host: Emotional aloneness.
[00:23:32.317 - 00:23:32.838] Guest: Yes, aloneness.
[00:23:32.858 - 00:23:34.660] Guest: Back to the loneliness where we started.
[00:23:35.160 - 00:23:35.400] Guest: Yeah.
[00:23:37.602 - 00:23:38.543] Guest: But it happens.
[00:23:38.603 - 00:23:42.147] Guest: Because see, as much as your family loves you and mind really supports me.
[00:23:42.687 - 00:23:44.909] Guest: You know, I have a lot of decisions.
[00:23:45.890 - 00:23:48.332] Guest: Maybe they, it wasn't normal decisions.
[00:23:48.413 - 00:23:50.575] Guest: Like going out of the house.
[00:23:50.635 - 00:23:51.555] Guest: Trying to act in the world.
[00:23:52.016 - 00:23:53.237] Guest: You know, to get a first film.
[00:23:53.537 - 00:23:54.258] Guest: To live alone.
[00:23:54.626 - 00:23:56.809] Guest: to maybe get married at a later age.
[00:23:57.290 - 00:24:03.299] Guest: All of these things are not normally accepted things, especially in a house like mine, but they've always understood me.
[00:24:03.800 - 00:24:07.927] Guest: But certain things they can't understand, and you wouldn't want to put that load on them either.
[00:24:11.112 - 00:24:12.694] Guest: It's getting too deep, right?
[00:24:12.714 - 00:24:13.575] Guest: No, it's fantastic.
[00:24:13.796 - 00:24:14.897] Host: It's fantastic.
[00:24:14.917 - 00:24:16.199] Host: You have so much to say.
[00:24:16.219 - 00:24:19.044] Host: Honestly, like... See, whatever tension I have in my mind, I say it.
[00:24:19.244 - 00:24:23.090] Host: When your name is on our schedule,
[00:24:23.170 - 00:24:26.494] Host: My team always asks me that where should I record?
[00:24:26.674 - 00:24:29.518] Host: Should I record at home or in this studio?
[00:24:29.538 - 00:24:33.002] Host: Nowadays, we are opening this studio for very few people.
[00:24:33.022 - 00:24:40.291] Host: And our internal rule is that as far as possible, we only open this studio for powerful women.
[00:24:40.311 - 00:24:41.212] Guest: That's amazing!
[00:24:41.592 - 00:24:44.416] Host: Powerful women means those who have more divine qualities.
[00:24:44.616 - 00:24:44.996] Guest: Wow!
[00:24:45.137 - 00:24:45.897] Guest: How lovely!
[00:24:46.138 - 00:24:46.839] Guest: Thank you!
[00:24:47.019 - 00:24:47.960] Guest: Thank you!
[00:24:49.602 - 00:24:52.005] Host: I didn't even have to think about it.
[00:24:52.025 - 00:24:52.946] Host: When I saw your name,
[00:24:53.090 - 00:24:55.733] Host: I immediately picked this studio for you.
[00:24:55.753 - 00:24:56.234] Guest: Thank you.
[00:24:56.334 - 00:24:59.718] Guest: How sweet and how divine, I would say.
[00:24:59.758 - 00:25:00.138] Guest: Thank you.
[00:25:00.418 - 00:25:00.999] Guest: Thank you for that.
[00:25:01.199 - 00:25:04.824] Host: Don't know why and I feel that you will bless this studio.
[00:25:04.844 - 00:25:06.145] Guest: That's my only request.
[00:25:06.185 - 00:25:06.626] Guest: 100%.
[00:25:06.726 - 00:25:11.051] Guest: No, but my everything good is always there for you.
[00:25:11.151 - 00:25:12.613] Guest: And of course, the studio, I love it.
[00:25:12.653 - 00:25:14.495] Guest: The vibe here is very positive.
[00:25:15.136 - 00:25:17.138] Guest: And it really feels like...
[00:25:17.158 - 00:25:19.481] Guest: I mean, there is a feeling of pressure sometimes.
[00:25:19.521 - 00:25:20.722] Guest: There is zero pressure.
[00:25:20.834 - 00:25:21.455] Guest: that I feel.
[00:25:21.475 - 00:25:23.077] Guest: There's zero judgment that I feel.
[00:25:23.097 - 00:25:28.343] Host: Like, you know, honestly, collectively, I know my guys also very well.
[00:25:28.804 - 00:25:31.207] Host: We all want to give you something, but we don't know what to give you.
[00:25:31.407 - 00:25:32.188] Guest: Just give me love.
[00:25:33.129 - 00:25:33.630] Host: Good vibes.
[00:25:33.730 - 00:25:34.571] Guest: Just give me love.
[00:25:35.071 - 00:25:35.712] Guest: Okay.
[00:25:35.852 - 00:25:36.373] Host: That you have.
[00:25:36.453 - 00:25:37.074] Guest: Just love.
[00:25:37.434 - 00:25:37.955] Guest: Yeah.
[00:25:37.975 - 00:25:39.857] Guest: I'm always like, yeah, just love.
[00:25:40.178 - 00:25:41.599] Host: Do you like gifts?
[00:25:41.800 - 00:25:44.463] Guest: I like love.
[00:25:44.523 - 00:25:47.106] Host: What is your love language?
[00:25:47.126 - 00:25:47.987] Guest: Very good question.
[00:25:48.408 - 00:25:50.450] Guest: I used to think that...
[00:25:51.394 - 00:25:53.297] Guest: Oh my God!
[00:25:53.317 - 00:25:58.126] Guest: So I used to think my love language was words of affirmation.
[00:25:59.027 - 00:26:00.730] Guest: Like positive things.
[00:26:00.830 - 00:26:04.998] Guest: But now I think my love language is action.
[00:26:06.921 - 00:26:12.851] Guest: Like in my head, not just a man but especially a man is someone who does what he says he'll do.
[00:26:13.653 - 00:26:14.354] Guest: That is a man.
[00:26:14.946 - 00:26:16.188] Guest: So just that.
[00:26:16.388 - 00:26:18.371] Host: Back up your words with action.
[00:26:18.391 - 00:26:20.474] Guest: If you're saying you're going to do it, do it.
[00:26:20.494 - 00:26:21.455] Guest: Otherwise don't say it.
[00:26:22.216 - 00:26:22.637] Host: You know.
[00:26:22.657 - 00:26:23.678] Host: So you don't want gifts.
[00:26:23.698 - 00:26:23.858] Host: Love.
[00:26:23.918 - 00:26:25.460] Host: You want love.
[00:26:25.480 - 00:26:26.001] Host: Love.
[00:26:26.021 - 00:26:28.845] Host: You want words and actions.
[00:26:28.865 - 00:26:29.566] Guest: I want actions.
[00:26:29.786 - 00:26:31.749] Guest: I don't want words.
[00:26:31.769 - 00:26:32.330] Guest: I don't want words.
[00:26:32.410 - 00:26:34.433] Guest: I have lost my faith in words.
[00:26:34.913 - 00:26:35.795] Host: Okay.
[00:26:35.875 - 00:26:37.637] Host: A lot of people say things to impress you.
[00:26:38.118 - 00:26:39.480] Guest: Yeah and I feel like people mean...
[00:26:39.500 - 00:26:41.222] Guest: So I've learned this one thing in Reiki.
[00:26:41.262 - 00:26:43.365] Guest: They say that emotion is energy in motion.
[00:26:43.786 - 00:26:44.146] Host: Oh wow.
[00:26:44.834 - 00:26:48.799] Guest: So even when you feel love for someone, right?
[00:26:49.660 - 00:26:50.721] Guest: It's moving energy.
[00:26:50.782 - 00:26:53.465] Guest: You feel it at a certain moment and then it moves away.
[00:26:54.006 - 00:26:55.147] Guest: And then you feel something else.
[00:26:55.648 - 00:27:01.675] Guest: So you can't take that particular emotion and base your whole life off of one emotion from someone else.
[00:27:02.156 - 00:27:04.599] Guest: Because that's emotion, energy in motion.
[00:27:05.019 - 00:27:06.241] Guest: So it will always change.
[00:27:07.022 - 00:27:10.226] Guest: That's why I'm not interested in words anymore.
[00:27:10.498 - 00:27:15.804] Host: My intention is that your future husband watches this podcast.
[00:27:15.824 - 00:27:16.445] Guest: Please watch it.
[00:27:16.465 - 00:27:18.167] Guest: It will be easy for me too.
[00:27:18.187 - 00:27:21.030] Guest: I don't have to indirectly say a lot of things, you know.
[00:27:21.051 - 00:27:22.412] Host: It will just be clear.
[00:27:22.432 - 00:27:25.356] Host: Do you want a good husband?
[00:27:25.656 - 00:27:27.939] Guest: A very good husband.
[00:27:28.359 - 00:27:34.707] Guest: I think there are some great men in this world.
[00:27:35.368 - 00:27:37.490] Guest: And my father being one of them.
[00:27:37.858 - 00:27:40.802] Guest: But yeah, there are some great, wonderful men in this world.
[00:27:40.842 - 00:27:42.765] Guest: And I believe that this will happen.
[00:27:42.885 - 00:27:55.703] Guest: I don't know why, but I always have this image of a very nice, positive, calm, stable, dependable man next to me with lots of dogs, a few kids.
[00:27:55.723 - 00:27:56.424] Host: Lots of dogs?
[00:27:56.444 - 00:27:57.725] Guest: Yeah, I love dogs.
[00:27:58.346 - 00:27:59.748] Guest: So lots of dogs.
[00:27:59.828 - 00:28:02.913] Guest: I do a lot of work for dogs as well, but we'll talk about that later.
[00:28:02.993 - 00:28:06.898] Guest: But yeah, I have this visual in my mind.
[00:28:07.170 - 00:28:08.972] Host: Doesn't sound like anyone from our industry.
[00:28:09.213 - 00:28:09.593] Host: Really?
[00:28:10.234 - 00:28:10.454] Guest: Yeah.
[00:28:10.474 - 00:28:17.483] Guest: But I love dogs, like I have my ultimate NGO type of dreams are to do with dogs, which I'm already working on.
[00:28:17.523 - 00:28:19.285] Guest: I wish I can do it.
[00:28:20.607 - 00:28:23.511] Guest: But yeah, but yeah, so the answer is yes.
[00:28:25.153 - 00:28:29.559] Guest: I think at the right time, right now, I don't have anyone like that in my life.
[00:28:29.999 - 00:28:35.346] Host: Loosely, I feel that in our industry, to find a compatible person from the industry is very difficult.
[00:28:35.874 - 00:28:37.376] Host: Because there is a lot of chaos in our world.
[00:28:37.396 - 00:28:42.902] Guest: There is a lot of chaos and I feel like somewhere there is a purity of a relationship.
[00:28:43.462 - 00:28:48.988] Guest: Somewhere I feel that it's missing not just in our industry but in many places right now.
[00:28:50.750 - 00:28:52.452] Guest: There is a need for old school love.
[00:28:53.273 - 00:28:57.117] Guest: Just pure relationship with no other intentions and just love, acceptance.
[00:28:57.998 - 00:29:01.362] Host: I feel that the love of our grandparents' generation used to be different.
[00:29:01.570 - 00:29:02.611] Host: Our generation.
[00:29:02.631 - 00:29:03.352] Guest: Absolutely.
[00:29:03.573 - 00:29:06.096] Guest: I think there was a lot of acceptance at that time.
[00:29:06.997 - 00:29:08.779] Guest: They weren't chasing perfection.
[00:29:09.100 - 00:29:10.962] Guest: That my partner should be perfect.
[00:29:11.283 - 00:29:12.144] Guest: There's no perfection.
[00:29:12.204 - 00:29:13.085] Guest: It was just acceptance.
[00:29:13.706 - 00:29:15.989] Guest: This is what is mine.
[00:29:16.349 - 00:29:17.431] Guest: It was literally like that.
[00:29:17.891 - 00:29:19.974] Guest: And that's what I feel love eventually is.
[00:29:20.074 - 00:29:22.357] Host: You know, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:29:22.397 - 00:29:24.060] Host: I think we're roughly in the same age group.
[00:29:24.280 - 00:29:27.584] Host: I think so, yeah.
[00:29:27.604 - 00:29:28.946] Host: But someone...
[00:29:29.186 - 00:29:33.471] Host: I think it was said on the show that arranged marriages are not always good.
[00:29:34.152 - 00:29:38.397] Host: But when they are good, you learn to love them.
[00:29:38.597 - 00:29:39.038] Guest: I agree.
[00:29:39.499 - 00:29:44.084] Host: And this is a very grown up take on love which is very true.
[00:29:45.906 - 00:29:51.593] Host: Because irrespective of who you date, you will get very frustrated with them in many moments.
[00:29:51.613 - 00:29:52.775] Host: But getting past the frustration.
[00:29:52.795 - 00:29:53.295] Guest: Absolutely.
[00:29:53.496 - 00:29:58.802] Guest: And I feel that in arranged marriages, so I am someone who is open to arranged marriages as well.
[00:29:59.426 - 00:30:07.059] Guest: later let's see but I know it's it's shocking but Gen Z what do you have to say about this?
[00:30:07.099 - 00:30:07.961] Guest: Can't connect.
[00:30:08.081 - 00:30:08.602] Guest: No, no.
[00:30:08.662 - 00:30:10.005] Guest: It's great.
[00:30:10.025 - 00:30:11.227] Guest: There are two extremes in Gen Z.
[00:30:11.748 - 00:30:24.530] Guest: But you know I've noticed that I've been hanging out with like these really young group of people nowadays I never thought I would get along with them but I'm actually yeah I feel they're very sensitive yeah about strong personalities you can always find
[00:30:24.738 - 00:30:26.582] Host: a group which suits us.
[00:30:26.602 - 00:30:30.810] Guest: Yeah, I was surprised because I usually got along with older people.
[00:30:31.511 - 00:30:36.020] Guest: But I was surprised to get along with like 23 year olds and I'm like, what is happening?
[00:30:36.180 - 00:30:39.026] Host: I think their education has increased a lot because of AI.
[00:30:39.298 - 00:30:40.280] Host: Mainly A.I.G.
[00:30:40.520 - 00:30:41.862] Host: but content also.
[00:30:42.403 - 00:30:45.428] Host: Like these people are studying more than us at that age.
[00:30:45.789 - 00:30:51.318] Host: And they quickly learn like we are talking as people in our thirties saying that in our thirties we've learned this.
[00:30:51.338 - 00:30:53.682] Host: But 22 year old watching this can gain that value at 22.
[00:30:54.063 - 00:30:56.306] Guest: And their EQ has become very high.
[00:30:56.707 - 00:30:57.448] Guest: That's what I feel.
[00:30:57.528 - 00:31:01.315] Guest: It's become higher than some of the people I know of my age and even older than me.
[00:31:01.796 - 00:31:05.682] Guest: I feel like their EQ is actually very very high.
[00:31:05.890 - 00:31:11.079] Host: Why will you write high EQ in your bio data?
[00:31:11.100 - 00:31:12.442] Guest: What will I write in my bio data?
[00:31:12.462 - 00:31:15.628] Guest: I will write simple woman.
[00:31:16.229 - 00:31:16.690] Host: Simple?
[00:31:17.391 - 00:31:18.032] Host: Simple woman.
[00:31:18.313 - 00:31:18.994] Guest: I mean simple.
[00:31:19.395 - 00:31:20.677] Host: That's it.
[00:31:20.897 - 00:31:21.879] Host: But you are not innocent.
[00:31:22.801 - 00:31:23.282] Guest: No.
[00:31:23.302 - 00:31:23.903] Host: You are sharp.
[00:31:24.203 - 00:31:26.327] Guest: I am smart but innocent.
[00:31:27.029 - 00:31:27.730] Guest: But not dumb.
[00:31:27.970 - 00:31:28.591] Guest: I am not dumb.
[00:31:29.653 - 00:31:30.034] Host: Do you know what?
[00:31:30.530 - 00:31:31.231] Host: I'm Marwadi.
[00:31:33.654 - 00:31:34.996] Guest: That is absolutely right.
[00:31:35.556 - 00:31:38.640] Guest: You know, I have become Ranveer, I have become so good with accounts.
[00:31:39.101 - 00:31:44.628] Guest: I feel that my genetics of Marwadiiness is kicking in now.
[00:31:44.648 - 00:31:46.470] Guest: I have become very good with accounts.
[00:31:46.570 - 00:31:48.032] Guest: I was never good at accounts.
[00:31:48.072 - 00:31:48.913] Guest: I mean, none of it.
[00:31:49.414 - 00:31:51.716] Guest: I mean, I have not got paid for half the things that I have done.
[00:31:52.497 - 00:31:52.978] Guest: But...
[00:31:53.282 - 00:31:56.927] Guest: Now suddenly my account has switched on, I've become too good at it.
[00:31:57.027 - 00:32:00.191] Host: That inner super power has been unlocked.
[00:32:00.951 - 00:32:02.153] Guest: All about the money.
[00:32:03.234 - 00:32:07.940] Host: It's also, I think Marwadi is definitely extremely good with money and all that.
[00:32:07.980 - 00:32:09.182] Host: Like those stereotypes that people know.
[00:32:09.222 - 00:32:14.548] Host: There is one more stereotype that you only know when your Marwadi friends are around.
[00:32:14.568 - 00:32:17.772] Host: That you guys are really sorted out friends to have.
[00:32:17.792 - 00:32:19.154] Host: Very nice friends.
[00:32:19.426 - 00:32:20.107] Guest: Oh really?
[00:32:20.508 - 00:32:22.090] Guest: I didn't know this was a stereotype.
[00:32:22.130 - 00:32:24.714] Host: There is no cheating in the Marwadi community.
[00:32:24.774 - 00:32:28.940] Host: That's why the community are so well in business also because integrity pays off in the long run.
[00:32:28.960 - 00:32:29.702] Guest: Integrity.
[00:32:30.222 - 00:32:31.424] Guest: Yes, absolutely.
[00:32:31.444 - 00:32:33.287] Host: There is a lot of integrity.
[00:32:33.307 - 00:32:35.210] Host: I feel very safe sitting in front of you.
[00:32:35.691 - 00:32:36.171] Guest: You are safe.
[00:32:37.513 - 00:32:40.718] Host: But this is generally felt in front of every Marwadi.
[00:32:40.898 - 00:32:42.281] Host: You know there is high integrity.
[00:32:42.401 - 00:32:48.530] Guest: Yeah, there is high integrity and somewhere there is always like an investment from a Marwadi brain if I have to think.
[00:32:48.642 - 00:32:50.064] Guest: Everything is an investment, right?
[00:32:50.444 - 00:32:53.347] Guest: So we always look at investments long-term, not short-term.
[00:32:54.148 - 00:32:55.049] Guest: Same with friendships.
[00:32:55.910 - 00:32:59.735] Guest: You know, you always invest in friendships so that they become long-term.
[00:32:59.755 - 00:33:02.398] Guest: The actual human equation.
[00:33:02.418 - 00:33:03.579] Guest: Yes, which are very important.
[00:33:03.719 - 00:33:06.903] Guest: I figured recently how important friendships are in life.
[00:33:07.704 - 00:33:09.066] Guest: And they really are.
[00:33:09.086 - 00:33:16.274] Host: Even Dhirubhai Ambani and Reliance generally, their main company culture is that they really take care of the people.
[00:33:16.546 - 00:33:17.247] Host: It's the same logic.
[00:33:17.427 - 00:33:21.191] Host: Long term businesses grow because of great, very deep relationships.
[00:33:21.531 - 00:33:23.533] Guest: I'll tell you one small story about my dad.
[00:33:23.713 - 00:33:33.503] Guest: So at his work, I don't know why I remember that but I think he was telling me this that in some meeting he... some guy made some mistake and then he was a bit rude to him.
[00:33:34.544 - 00:33:36.226] Guest: Bit rude for him is normal.
[00:33:36.586 - 00:33:38.808] Guest: I mean, he will be normal, the way we talk.
[00:33:39.629 - 00:33:44.274] Guest: And the next day he went back and he apologized to the same guy in front of everyone in the office.
[00:33:44.802 - 00:33:46.444] Guest: You know that I'm really sorry yesterday.
[00:33:46.464 - 00:33:47.605] Guest: I should not have said that to you.
[00:33:48.346 - 00:33:50.288] Guest: So I think it's things like that.
[00:33:50.968 - 00:33:55.072] Guest: You know where your respect grows in front of the people that you work with as well.
[00:33:55.132 - 00:33:58.276] Guest: So I think things like that are very important.
[00:33:58.596 - 00:33:59.637] Guest: The way you treat people.
[00:33:59.957 - 00:34:01.459] Host: Cultural thread of integrity.
[00:34:01.539 - 00:34:02.040] Guest: Yes.
[00:34:02.280 - 00:34:05.363] Host: Have you ever been to Rajasthan?
[00:34:05.783 - 00:34:05.984] Guest: No?
[00:34:06.004 - 00:34:08.726] Guest: There is no Rajasthan in my family.
[00:34:09.047 - 00:34:11.149] Host: But have you ever been on a trip?
[00:34:11.169 - 00:34:11.309] Guest: No.
[00:34:11.329 - 00:34:12.370] Guest: Surprisingly no.
[00:34:12.482 - 00:34:12.823] Guest: Really?
[00:34:12.863 - 00:34:14.606] Guest: What kind of a Marwari am I?
[00:34:14.626 - 00:34:16.369] Guest: I have not gone to my roots.
[00:34:16.389 - 00:34:17.291] Guest: Why not?
[00:34:17.311 - 00:34:17.892] Guest: I don't know.
[00:34:17.912 - 00:34:18.573] Guest: It never happened.
[00:34:18.593 - 00:34:19.515] Guest: My parents have gone.
[00:34:19.615 - 00:34:23.562] Guest: But I for some reason never got the opportunity to go.
[00:34:23.583 - 00:34:24.765] Guest: I have to go.
[00:34:25.085 - 00:34:25.907] Host: I will go.
[00:34:25.927 - 00:34:26.969] Guest: Do you like travelling?
[00:34:26.989 - 00:34:27.911] Host: I like it.
[00:34:28.071 - 00:34:29.874] Host: Where do you normally go?
[00:34:29.954 - 00:34:33.300] Guest: I love going to, for holidays I love going to London.
[00:34:34.302 - 00:34:36.306] Guest: I don't know why, but I think Indians love London.
[00:34:36.706 - 00:34:38.228] Host: I don't know what else is there.
[00:34:38.248 - 00:34:39.710] Host: There are a lot of things in London.
[00:34:40.051 - 00:34:41.693] Host: There is culture, entertainment.
[00:34:41.713 - 00:34:44.397] Guest: And it's a little bit, you feel nice also.
[00:34:44.437 - 00:34:45.639] Guest: It's a little bit like India.
[00:34:45.659 - 00:34:47.041] Guest: Indian food is very good in London.
[00:34:47.161 - 00:34:47.942] Host: Dishoom.
[00:34:47.962 - 00:34:49.925] Guest: Dishoom and what is it?
[00:34:49.945 - 00:34:50.666] Guest: Tamarind.
[00:34:50.686 - 00:34:52.789] Guest: Tamarind is also very very good.
[00:34:52.809 - 00:34:55.472] Guest: Gymkhana is also very good.
[00:34:55.512 - 00:34:57.515] Guest: Very iconic Indian restaurant.
[00:34:57.575 - 00:35:02.322] Guest: So in London and India, I love going to like these Jyotiling places.
[00:35:02.466 - 00:35:03.988] Guest: Spiritual places.
[00:35:04.109 - 00:35:04.970] Guest: Dharamic travel.
[00:35:04.990 - 00:35:05.651] Guest: Yes, dharamic travel.
[00:35:05.671 - 00:35:06.392] Guest: I like it a lot.
[00:35:06.432 - 00:35:10.498] Host: Can I share a tangent with you?
[00:35:10.518 - 00:35:14.244] Host: YouTube careers survive and grow because of reinvention.
[00:35:14.905 - 00:35:16.127] Host: It's like a muscle.
[00:35:16.147 - 00:35:17.990] Host: You're always working at the back of your head.
[00:35:18.711 - 00:35:20.153] Host: What should I do next?
[00:35:20.173 - 00:35:21.736] Host: So our new thing is documentaries.
[00:35:22.517 - 00:35:25.301] Host: And the easiest way for me to do documentaries is travel.
[00:35:25.962 - 00:35:26.743] Host: I like it a lot.
[00:35:26.763 - 00:35:28.466] Host: I go to crazy places.
[00:35:28.546 - 00:35:30.488] Host: I have been there but I haven't shot everywhere.
[00:35:30.869 - 00:35:34.232] Host: I have to go out of places.
[00:35:34.253 - 00:35:38.557] Host: Since I think the last 2-3 months, we have begun this new project.
[00:35:38.618 - 00:35:45.706] Host: It's a documentary project where we go to the corners of the country and create an Anthony Bourdain style travel show.
[00:35:46.166 - 00:35:49.130] Host: But the core of it is dharmic.
[00:35:49.150 - 00:35:53.074] Host: Because there are so many dharmic places in India.
[00:35:53.218 - 00:35:57.642] Host: Like this week a witchcraft practitioner came on the show.
[00:35:57.662 - 00:35:58.403] Host: How interesting.
[00:35:58.423 - 00:36:00.985] Host: It's not dark, it's white vika.
[00:36:01.746 - 00:36:06.531] Host: So he said that in global vika, do you know where their main temple is?
[00:36:06.551 - 00:36:07.632] Guest: In Orissa.
[00:36:07.732 - 00:36:09.914] Guest: Orissa has a lot of temples and everything.
[00:36:10.694 - 00:36:12.796] Host: It's called Chausat Yogini temple.
[00:36:12.957 - 00:36:14.238] Host: It's a round temple which is open.
[00:36:14.838 - 00:36:17.841] Host: And the main idol there is an idol of something called Mahamaya.
[00:36:18.061 - 00:36:23.026] Host: Mahamaya is the same entity that every vikan prays to, which is mother nature.
[00:36:23.778 - 00:36:25.380] Guest: Same as mother nature.
[00:36:25.500 - 00:36:29.065] Host: So I am like there is so much left to explore in India.
[00:36:29.185 - 00:36:31.388] Guest: I think in India there is so much left to explore.
[00:36:31.408 - 00:36:35.514] Guest: There is so much left to I think even for people to know that these places exist.
[00:36:36.135 - 00:36:39.940] Guest: The smallest of the smallest places have the most powerful temples some of them.
[00:36:40.321 - 00:36:44.386] Guest: If you talk to the locals there they will tell you that this place is very very powerful.
[00:36:45.107 - 00:36:48.752] Host: They say that Banaras has become the most travel to place.
[00:36:49.233 - 00:36:50.034] Host: That's so true.
[00:36:50.178 - 00:36:51.440] Guest: I get why.
[00:36:52.062 - 00:36:54.486] Host: Like once you go there, you get why completely.
[00:36:55.168 - 00:36:57.532] Host: When we were growing up, we weren't told about like all these places.
[00:36:57.572 - 00:36:58.253] Guest: True, true.
[00:36:58.414 - 00:36:58.995] Guest: What about us?
[00:36:59.015 - 00:36:59.536] Guest: Singapore.
[00:36:59.556 - 00:37:00.277] Host: Singapore.
[00:37:00.297 - 00:37:00.818] Host: Go to USA.
[00:37:00.858 - 00:37:03.203] Guest: Yes, Dubai, Singapore, USA.
[00:37:03.403 - 00:37:06.068] Host: Now suddenly Gen Z has discovered Banaras and Orissa.
[00:37:06.449 - 00:37:13.202] Guest: I just saw this video, I don't know if it was an AI video or a normal video, where they were like these kids, Gen Z kids doing a bhajan party.
[00:37:13.442 - 00:37:15.924] Guest: But without alcohol obviously.
[00:37:15.944 - 00:37:17.226] Guest: But it was a bhajan party.
[00:37:17.246 - 00:37:19.488] Guest: And I was like, someone invite me to this please.
[00:37:19.808 - 00:37:20.769] Guest: You wanna go bhajan clubbing?
[00:37:20.949 - 00:37:21.990] Guest: I would love to do that.
[00:37:22.010 - 00:37:23.171] Guest: But that exists.
[00:37:23.712 - 00:37:24.532] Host: Are you in Bombay often?
[00:37:25.053 - 00:37:25.673] Guest: No, not really.
[00:37:25.774 - 00:37:28.236] Guest: I mean I have two Hindi films.
[00:37:28.256 - 00:37:29.237] Host: So when it started I came.
[00:37:29.257 - 00:37:30.178] Host: But where do you live now?
[00:37:31.439 - 00:37:32.099] Guest: Great question.
[00:37:32.320 - 00:37:34.502] Guest: So I'm from Bangalore.
[00:37:34.622 - 00:37:39.086] Guest: I shifted to Bombay maybe 8 years ago when I wanted to get into films.
[00:37:39.426 - 00:37:40.848] Guest: To try to become an actor.
[00:37:41.068 - 00:37:42.389] Guest: To audition.
[00:37:42.449 - 00:37:43.410] Guest: I was here for a year.
[00:37:43.746 - 00:37:45.629] Guest: In that one year, I got my first picture.
[00:37:46.370 - 00:37:50.576] Guest: And after that, I stayed here for two years before COVID went back to Bangalore.
[00:37:51.858 - 00:37:54.222] Guest: After COVID shifted to Hyderabad.
[00:37:54.242 - 00:37:55.384] Guest: So now I'm in Hyderabad.
[00:37:55.404 - 00:37:57.607] Host: So my... Pan India beauty.
[00:37:57.667 - 00:38:00.391] Guest: Yes, pan India.
[00:38:00.471 - 00:38:01.433] Guest: It's a bit complicated.
[00:38:01.593 - 00:38:02.294] Host: Pan India life.
[00:38:02.654 - 00:38:03.376] Guest: Pan India life.
[00:38:04.357 - 00:38:08.463] Host: Sorry, a kind of meme, a kind of joke, a kind of compliment for you.
[00:38:08.724 - 00:38:10.086] Host: From the whole team.
[00:38:10.206 - 00:38:13.010] Host: So we do a lot of research for every guest.
[00:38:13.218 - 00:38:16.421] Host: we can talk, our tangents can be opened.
[00:38:16.441 - 00:38:27.772] Host: There is a core thought associated with you that if someone goes to a very advanced chatbot and says, Hey AI, please create me an Indian beauty, it will create something like Nidhi Agarwal.
[00:38:28.112 - 00:38:29.033] Guest: How sweet.
[00:38:29.053 - 00:38:31.876] Host: You look AI generated but actually you are real.
[00:38:31.896 - 00:38:32.697] Host: It's as a compliment.
[00:38:32.717 - 00:38:35.119] Guest: Listen, I feel the same way.
[00:38:35.139 - 00:38:38.442] Guest: Sometimes when I look at my own pictures, I am like, this is looking like AI.
[00:38:39.203 - 00:38:40.604] Guest: Ranveer, what is wrong with me?
[00:38:40.644 - 00:38:41.325] Host: No, it's a good thing.
[00:38:41.605 - 00:38:41.965] Guest: Is it?
[00:38:42.026 - 00:38:42.546] Host: Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:43.330 - 00:38:47.095] Host: Definitely AI models have trained on your face.
[00:38:47.115 - 00:38:49.138] Guest: Because even I feel this.
[00:38:49.739 - 00:38:52.222] Guest: Maybe it's like, it's catching aura or something?
[00:38:52.522 - 00:38:53.163] Host: I don't know.
[00:38:53.183 - 00:38:56.307] Guest: It's something with the face or I don't know what it is.
[00:38:56.327 - 00:38:57.569] Guest: But I feel this as well.
[00:38:57.629 - 00:38:58.430] Host: It's a compliment.
[00:38:58.731 - 00:39:01.234] Guest: Then great, thank you.
[00:39:02.376 - 00:39:05.039] Host: Sorry, I had to get that out of my head.
[00:39:05.219 - 00:39:06.741] Host: These random tangents are to share with you.
[00:39:06.761 - 00:39:08.944] Guest: Maybe I'm a robot.
[00:39:09.004 - 00:39:10.506] Guest: Maybe I'm a robot.
[00:39:10.526 - 00:39:13.170] Host: Do you know robots are going to become a thing now?
[00:39:13.346 - 00:39:13.807] Host: I've heard.
[00:39:14.688 - 00:39:16.771] Host: Have you ever seen a Jetsons cartoon?
[00:39:16.791 - 00:39:16.871] Unknown: No.
[00:39:16.931 - 00:39:18.854] Host: Have you seen Flintstones?
[00:39:18.874 - 00:39:19.134] Host: Yes.
[00:39:19.494 - 00:39:21.317] Host: Flintstones was set in Stone Age.
[00:39:21.337 - 00:39:23.039] Host: Jetsons was set in the future.
[00:39:23.059 - 00:39:23.400] Host: Oh great.
[00:39:23.420 - 00:39:25.603] Host: Where they used to come in a flying car for cars.
[00:39:25.623 - 00:39:25.783] Host: Oh nice.
[00:39:25.803 - 00:39:26.845] Guest: Those won't be tires.
[00:39:26.865 - 00:39:29.348] Guest: Yes, it's like a... Shit, then what about our business?
[00:39:29.428 - 00:39:33.113] Host: No, I think flying cars are also coming.
[00:39:33.133 - 00:39:36.658] Host: I mean, I have done so many science and tech podcasts recently.
[00:39:37.538 - 00:39:40.824] Host: It's crazy what's going to happen in the next five years.
[00:39:40.844 - 00:39:43.869] Guest: I think in the next five years even actors will not have to act.
[00:39:44.590 - 00:39:45.832] Guest: Because everything will be AI.
[00:39:47.395 - 00:39:49.338] Guest: That's what we all talk about all the time.
[00:39:50.039 - 00:39:52.924] Host: As far as I understood, what you're saying is right.
[00:39:52.944 - 00:39:56.450] Host: There's a Black Mirror episode of Salma Hayek.
[00:39:56.470 - 00:39:56.851] Host: I've seen that.
[00:39:56.871 - 00:39:59.235] Guest: It's very famous and everyone should watch that episode.
[00:39:59.255 - 00:40:03.282] Host: But in America, there are two types of fruits and vegetables.
[00:40:03.714 - 00:40:06.137] Host: There are organic vegetables and inorganic.
[00:40:06.397 - 00:40:09.640] Host: So I feel that AI generated content of any kind is going to be treated as inorganic.
[00:40:09.680 - 00:40:10.201] Guest: Inorganic.
[00:40:10.241 - 00:40:13.444] Guest: And then organic will have more value.
[00:40:13.484 - 00:40:18.250] Host: Because there are some human nuances and expressions that AI can't mimic.
[00:40:18.310 - 00:40:19.491] Guest: I completely agree with you.
[00:40:20.352 - 00:40:22.774] Guest: But we'll have to see.
[00:40:22.794 - 00:40:23.655] Guest: Right?
[00:40:23.675 - 00:40:25.718] Host: Excited or scared of the future?
[00:40:26.338 - 00:40:26.859] Guest: Excited.
[00:40:27.099 - 00:40:28.180] Guest: Excited.
[00:40:28.501 - 00:40:30.242] Guest: Because see, not like I can control it.
[00:40:30.543 - 00:40:32.225] Guest: Whatever has to happen will happen.
[00:40:32.245 - 00:40:33.586] Guest: Rather be excited for it.
[00:40:33.794 - 00:40:35.175] Host: Would you want to have children in this world?
[00:40:36.857 - 00:40:39.279] Guest: See, I have always wanted to have children.
[00:40:39.339 - 00:40:42.062] Guest: I think as a child, I've always wanted to have children.
[00:40:42.082 - 00:40:42.602] Guest: Seriously.
[00:40:43.063 - 00:40:49.669] Guest: Like, I always thought that, you know, I will adopt a kid, like how Sushmita Sen. That memory is very deeply imprinted in my mind.
[00:40:50.130 - 00:40:51.331] Guest: But no, I want to have kids.
[00:40:53.673 - 00:41:01.500] Guest: Rais karna thoda mujhe extra time, attention, dhyaan, ek alag world create karna padega, which also might not be good actually.
[00:41:02.121 - 00:41:03.122] Guest: But... What do you mean?
[00:41:03.554 - 00:41:06.998] Guest: If I create a different world, then how will they adapt to this world?
[00:41:08.100 - 00:41:10.363] Guest: So I'll have to keep them in reality in some way.
[00:41:10.383 - 00:41:12.165] Host: How do you make a child strong?
[00:41:12.245 - 00:41:12.466] Host: Yes.
[00:41:14.088 - 00:41:15.590] Guest: But no, I want to have kids.
[00:41:16.471 - 00:41:17.152] Guest: Lots of kids.
[00:41:17.552 - 00:41:18.233] Host: Lots of kids?
[00:41:18.854 - 00:41:19.635] Guest: Lots of kids.
[00:41:20.416 - 00:41:21.738] Guest: How many?
[00:41:21.758 - 00:41:22.158] Host: 3-4.
[00:41:22.178 - 00:41:23.280] Host: Are you ready for 4 kids?
[00:41:23.300 - 00:41:23.640] Host: Why?
[00:41:24.541 - 00:41:25.022] Guest: I don't know.
[00:41:25.042 - 00:41:27.405] Guest: I've always wanted kids.
[00:41:27.905 - 00:41:29.127] Guest: I think I've always been a mother.
[00:41:29.147 - 00:41:31.410] Guest: So my sister is 7 years younger than me.
[00:41:31.554 - 00:41:34.917] Guest: And my parents didn't plan on like having a second child.
[00:41:34.937 - 00:41:36.399] Guest: They were like, okay, one more full stop.
[00:41:36.739 - 00:41:38.160] Guest: But I remember writing letters.
[00:41:38.180 - 00:41:41.343] Guest: I want a baby sister and keeping it in the puja room every day.
[00:41:41.383 - 00:41:43.486] Guest: And... Wow!
[00:41:43.506 - 00:41:44.987] Guest: Manifest your sister.
[00:41:45.507 - 00:41:49.331] Guest: And I literally thought that God has sent me, you know, my sister.
[00:41:49.351 - 00:41:50.793] Guest: So I was literally like her mother.
[00:41:51.493 - 00:41:53.135] Guest: I was like a 7-8 year old kid.
[00:41:53.155 - 00:41:54.696] Guest: I used to take care of her so much.
[00:41:54.736 - 00:41:55.877] Guest: And even today we don't fight.
[00:41:55.958 - 00:41:57.239] Guest: Our age gap is too much.
[00:41:57.639 - 00:41:59.041] Guest: But she's like my baby, you know.
[00:41:59.181 - 00:42:00.562] Guest: I don't see her like my sister.
[00:42:00.962 - 00:42:08.011] Guest: So I have a lot of that motherly instinct, feeling... Elder sibling romance.
[00:42:08.232 - 00:42:09.694] Guest: I really have that in me.
[00:42:09.714 - 00:42:12.838] Guest: So even in a group of friends, I end up becoming the caretaker.
[00:42:12.858 - 00:42:16.783] Guest: Like I just make sure everybody is safe and everybody is good.
[00:42:18.385 - 00:42:20.508] Host: Do your friends treat you like a famous person?
[00:42:20.709 - 00:42:21.850] Host: No.
[00:42:21.950 - 00:42:22.151] Host: No?
[00:42:22.351 - 00:42:22.551] Host: No.
[00:42:22.731 - 00:42:23.653] Guest: How do they treat you?
[00:42:23.673 - 00:42:24.654] Guest: I think very normally.
[00:42:24.674 - 00:42:26.536] Guest: I have two groups of friends.
[00:42:26.757 - 00:42:27.698] Guest: One is a fun group.
[00:42:27.906 - 00:42:29.308] Guest: that, you know, we just hang out.
[00:42:29.388 - 00:42:30.068] Guest: We go.
[00:42:30.149 - 00:42:32.051] Guest: I haven't had alcohol in the last six years.
[00:42:32.972 - 00:42:36.436] Guest: So that part of my life is kind of done.
[00:42:37.076 - 00:42:38.037] Guest: But I mean, yeah.
[00:42:38.077 - 00:42:41.381] Guest: So I have a friend group, like a chill group that I hang out with sometimes.
[00:42:41.742 - 00:42:45.486] Guest: But I have like certain friends who've been my friends for like 20, 22 years.
[00:42:46.287 - 00:42:50.331] Guest: So we meet more for like coffees and green tea and stuff like that.
[00:42:50.451 - 00:42:52.914] Guest: And we really have, you know, we speak a lot.
[00:42:52.974 - 00:42:56.338] Guest: We're in touch, but we don't share much of our work stuff.
[00:42:56.674 - 00:42:59.217] Guest: So we talk about everything other than work.
[00:42:59.237 - 00:43:00.119] Host: Why did you stop drinking?
[00:43:01.741 - 00:43:07.889] Guest: I don't know why, but at some point, you know, I just started feeling not good when I drank alcohol.
[00:43:07.949 - 00:43:10.252] Guest: I started feeling a little bit of anxiety.
[00:43:10.312 - 00:43:12.555] Guest: I did not enjoy it.
[00:43:13.477 - 00:43:17.101] Guest: I started feeling panicky and then I'm like, okay, so I'm not liking this.
[00:43:17.141 - 00:43:19.465] Guest: My body is not accepting it.
[00:43:19.485 - 00:43:20.906] Guest: It's rejecting it almost.
[00:43:21.507 - 00:43:23.570] Guest: So I was like, okay, stop.
[00:43:24.066 - 00:43:26.470] Guest: So no alcohol, no partying, clubbing.
[00:43:26.650 - 00:43:30.155] Guest: I mean, I like to hang out with people, but there's just no alcohol involved with me.
[00:43:30.195 - 00:43:40.872] Host: They can drink, but... Like there's a saying about Millennials that the same people who are going to clubs and partying when they were 18 or 19 are going for Kirtans and meditation classes.
[00:43:40.892 - 00:43:42.374] Guest: I started drinking when I was 14.
[00:43:42.394 - 00:43:43.095] Host: Oh wow!
[00:43:43.155 - 00:43:47.261] Guest: I mean, not started drinking, like I've had alcohol and all when I was 14.
[00:43:48.063 - 00:43:48.644] Guest: So... Why?
[00:43:49.745 - 00:43:50.226] Guest: School.
[00:43:50.306 - 00:43:51.848] Host: Just the people around you.
[00:43:51.868 - 00:43:53.490] Guest: Yeah, fun, school, going out.
[00:43:53.590 - 00:43:54.472] Host: Rebelliousness.
[00:43:54.492 - 00:43:55.713] Guest: Yeah, it was fun at that point.
[00:43:55.793 - 00:43:58.777] Guest: And at that point of time in school, college, it was fun.
[00:43:58.797 - 00:44:02.783] Guest: I used to enjoy myself, you know, when I was drinking.
[00:44:02.823 - 00:44:06.027] Guest: But after a point, it started becoming a panic.
[00:44:08.190 - 00:44:11.794] Host: We have a nice phase of partying for 10 years and then we realize, okay, time to grow up.
[00:44:11.834 - 00:44:13.857] Guest: That's enough, let's grow up.
[00:44:13.877 - 00:44:17.522] Host: Yeah, and I see the same pattern a lot.
[00:44:17.986 - 00:44:20.849] Host: There are two types of Millennials around me.
[00:44:20.869 - 00:44:21.670] Host: One is towards you.
[00:44:21.690 - 00:44:22.731] Host: Those who have chilled.
[00:44:23.132 - 00:44:23.933] Host: I am also in the same category.
[00:44:23.953 - 00:44:24.634] Host: Oh great!
[00:44:24.654 - 00:44:25.795] Guest: So you have also stopped drinking.
[00:44:25.815 - 00:44:27.637] Host: I have had a very hard partying.
[00:44:28.118 - 00:44:30.921] Host: At this point, let's find a party in green tea.
[00:44:31.081 - 00:44:31.622] Guest: Absolutely!
[00:44:32.002 - 00:44:39.871] Guest: Green tea, a good episode of friends, talking to your friends, sleeping at night, waking up early, going for a walk.
[00:44:40.672 - 00:44:42.874] Guest: This is life and this is fun.
[00:44:43.815 - 00:44:44.236] Host: Isn't it?
[00:44:44.636 - 00:44:46.098] Host: Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:46.914 - 00:44:53.404] Host: I was talking to one of my millennial friends that I feel that at least in our age group everyone is going back to what they enjoyed as kids.
[00:44:53.925 - 00:44:54.506] Guest: I think so.
[00:44:54.526 - 00:44:56.128] Host: And that's different for different people.
[00:44:56.148 - 00:44:56.449] Guest: Yeah.
[00:44:58.011 - 00:45:00.395] Host: Anyway, but friends for some people.
[00:45:00.415 - 00:45:04.741] Host: Like for me it's become a lot of I've gotten back into football and PlayStation.
[00:45:04.942 - 00:45:05.683] Host: It sounds immature.
[00:45:05.703 - 00:45:06.244] Host: How nice.
[00:45:06.464 - 00:45:07.205] Host: But I balance it.
[00:45:07.225 - 00:45:08.728] Guest: No, but what's immature in it?
[00:45:09.148 - 00:45:11.332] Guest: I think it's great.
[00:45:11.352 - 00:45:12.914] Guest: Even if we see
[00:45:12.994 - 00:45:17.653] Guest: So all of your senses, it's like even people who race, they practice so much of that thing.
[00:45:17.693 - 00:45:20.645] Guest: What is that called?
[00:45:20.725 - 00:45:21.106] Host: Reflex.

[00:45:51.972 - 00:45:54.174] Guest: No, Christ was not a good experience for me.
[00:45:54.194 - 00:45:55.155] Guest: It's a great college.

[00:46:59.156 - 00:47:02.841] Guest: We used to understand our studies because there was no concept of mugging up and writing.
[00:47:03.362 - 00:47:06.386] Guest: You had to create a project so you had to understand what you are studying.
[00:47:06.594 - 00:47:08.116] Guest: Like now we are studying civics.
[00:47:08.576 - 00:47:10.438] Guest: So we had to make two political parties.
[00:47:10.479 - 00:47:13.342] Guest: We really had to do that, you know.

[00:47:23.374 - 00:47:24.495] Guest: Back, right?
[00:47:24.515 - 00:47:25.896] Host: That there is that energy.
[00:47:25.917 - 00:47:29.721] Host: Like you still have a lot of front bench and energy, but I can tell it's some evolution that's going on.
[00:47:29.741 - 00:47:30.642] Guest: Yeah, I think so.
[00:47:30.850 - 00:47:31.531] Guest: Yeah, back.
[00:47:31.571 - 00:47:33.793] Guest: But I've always been a very sweet girl.
[00:47:33.853 - 00:47:35.455] Guest: Like I've been naughty but very sweet.
[00:47:35.875 - 00:47:39.058] Guest: Because my parents were always like, they can call us to school, it's okay.
[00:47:39.078 - 00:47:40.500] Guest: But don't do anything bad.
[00:47:41.020 - 00:47:42.602] Guest: You can be naughty but you can't be bad.
[00:47:43.162 - 00:47:44.403] Host: You used to assist.
[00:47:44.904 - 00:47:45.024] Guest: Yes.
[00:47:45.084 - 00:47:47.887] Guest: I mean, what used to happen to me?
[00:47:47.947 - 00:47:48.968] Guest: Laughing, eating secretly.
[00:47:49.228 - 00:47:50.970] Guest: You know, that kind of stupidity.
[00:47:50.990 - 00:47:52.331] Host: Have you ever copied in the test?
[00:47:53.332 - 00:47:53.572] Guest: No.
[00:47:53.953 - 00:47:54.293] Host: No?
[00:47:54.453 - 00:47:55.634] Guest: No, I haven't copied.
[00:47:55.654 - 00:47:57.676] Host: That's the real test.
[00:47:57.697 - 00:47:59.218] Host: Badness is necessary in life.
[00:47:59.938 - 00:48:01.080] Guest: No.
[00:48:01.540 - 00:48:01.861] Host: No?
[00:48:02.662 - 00:48:03.923] Host: It should be nice.
[00:48:04.404 - 00:48:06.267] Guest: I think you should be right.
[00:48:06.807 - 00:48:10.612] Guest: Like I know today, in today's world, everybody believes that there's no right and wrong.
[00:48:10.813 - 00:48:12.915] Guest: There is gray and somewhere even the divine says that.
[00:48:13.296 - 00:48:15.379] Guest: But maybe I haven't reached that level yet.
[00:48:15.940 - 00:48:18.783] Guest: I certainly believe there is a right and there is a wrong.
[00:48:19.504 - 00:48:19.765] Guest: You know?
[00:48:20.265 - 00:48:21.367] Host: So copying is unethical?
[00:48:21.827 - 00:48:22.168] Guest: No.
[00:48:23.229 - 00:48:24.010] Guest: That's okay.
[00:48:24.071 - 00:48:24.892] Guest: That is fine.
[00:48:24.932 - 00:48:25.993] Guest: It's a small thing.
[00:48:26.073 - 00:48:26.674] Guest: It works.
[00:48:26.754 - 00:48:30.759] Guest: See sometimes you copy, sometimes you help your friends also by showing them.
[00:48:30.800 - 00:48:31.901] Host: That's how I look at it.
[00:48:31.921 - 00:48:32.282] Host: Correct.
[00:48:32.622 - 00:48:33.123] Guest: So what?
[00:48:33.603 - 00:48:33.964] Host: Correct.
[00:48:34.144 - 00:48:36.968] Guest: It's friendship, it's not bad.
[00:48:37.389 - 00:48:39.571] Guest: These things are not counted.
[00:48:39.592 - 00:48:42.395] Host: In engineering college, I got passed because of a brother.
[00:48:42.636 - 00:48:45.439] Host: He used to tell me a lot of things in the exam hall.
[00:48:45.900 - 00:48:49.645] Host: So every year I message him saying thank you because you have a YouTube career.
[00:48:49.745 - 00:48:50.306] Guest: Really?
[00:48:50.326 - 00:48:51.968] Guest: So you have a lot of gratitude inside you.
[00:48:52.008 - 00:48:53.170] Host: That's great.
[00:48:53.410 - 00:48:55.153] Host: And that is also called your welcome.
[00:48:55.313 - 00:48:57.036] Host: I really feel that I am on YouTube because of that guy.
[00:48:57.316 - 00:48:57.957] Guest: How sweet.
[00:48:58.057 - 00:48:59.299] Guest: No, it's good to give credit.
[00:48:59.399 - 00:49:00.121] Guest: I think that's a me.
[00:49:00.141 - 00:49:01.623] Guest: And that shows how nice you are.
[00:49:02.184 - 00:49:04.287] Guest: You know, that you have so much of gratitude.
[00:49:05.769 - 00:49:08.754] Host: I feel that every person's life has weak phases and strong phases.
[00:49:08.774 - 00:49:11.318] Guest: There is a graph, right?
[00:49:11.338 - 00:49:12.460] Guest: It's up and down.
[00:49:12.480 - 00:49:13.221] Guest: That's the graph.
[00:49:13.281 - 00:49:15.044] Host: You're into astrology, right?
[00:49:15.064 - 00:49:16.226] Guest: I mean, I am.
[00:49:16.246 - 00:49:17.728] Guest: I believe in astrology.
[00:49:17.929 - 00:49:21.394] Guest: I used to wear a couple of rings and all, which I took all of them out.
[00:49:21.698 - 00:49:23.380] Guest: So that I stopped doing.
[00:49:23.660 - 00:49:24.722] Guest: You know your own chart?
[00:49:24.742 - 00:49:25.423] Guest: I know my chart.
[00:49:25.623 - 00:49:26.644] Host: You have strong Saturn?
[00:49:27.125 - 00:49:29.928] Guest: I have a... You are so good.
[00:49:30.489 - 00:49:38.920] Guest: So I have a very strong Saturn, a very strong exalted Jupiter and Rahu.
[00:49:39.140 - 00:49:40.121] Guest: Very very strong Rahu.
[00:49:40.141 - 00:49:41.102] Guest: Rahu 10th.
[00:49:42.624 - 00:49:43.566] Guest: Saturn 11th.
[00:49:44.226 - 00:49:44.767] Guest: Rahu 10th.
[00:49:46.049 - 00:49:47.090] Guest: And Jupiter...
[00:49:47.490 - 00:49:49.653] Guest: I don't know, maybe 4th or 5th or 6th, something.
[00:49:50.314 - 00:49:51.876] Guest: So you also have something like that.
[00:49:52.016 - 00:49:53.418] Host: Learning it, learning the energies.
[00:49:53.458 - 00:49:56.222] Host: But I think it's like a media professional thing to have a strong Rahu.
[00:49:56.843 - 00:50:00.368] Guest: Rahu, I've heard, they say that Rahu is the 10th in the world.
[00:50:00.388 - 00:50:01.670] Guest: Recently someone told me that.
[00:50:01.690 - 00:50:04.774] Host: You know, people think that Rahu is a villainous thing in some chart.
[00:50:05.195 - 00:50:07.798] Host: But have you ever seen the Spider-Man movie?
[00:50:07.958 - 00:50:09.601] Host: There is a villain in it, Mysterio.
[00:50:09.621 - 00:50:13.426] Host: So Mysterio uses illusions to fight Spider-Man.
[00:50:13.538 - 00:50:14.940] Host: Rahu is that ability.
[00:50:15.181 - 00:50:17.003] Host: The ability to create illusion.
[00:50:17.023 - 00:50:18.866] Host: Which is why media careers are good for strong minds.
[00:50:18.886 - 00:50:19.287] Guest: Maya.
[00:50:19.307 - 00:50:20.148] Host: Yeah.
[00:50:20.168 - 00:50:21.510] Host: I mean it's related to our work.
[00:50:21.530 - 00:50:24.895] Guest: It is absolutely and digital they say is completely related to Rahu.
[00:50:25.496 - 00:50:30.885] Guest: But I feel you know what, even in Reiki, sorry I'm going back to Reiki, but we have seven bodies.
[00:50:31.405 - 00:50:33.028] Guest: So one is our actual body.
[00:50:33.469 - 00:50:37.895] Guest: Then the seventh layer of the body is the astronomical body.
[00:50:38.436 - 00:50:38.817] Guest: Astral?
[00:50:39.258 - 00:50:40.359] Guest: Astral body.
[00:50:40.419 - 00:50:42.162] Guest: So that's connected to the planets.
[00:50:42.274 - 00:50:46.241] Guest: So somewhere, the planets, the position and everything impacts you.
[00:50:47.423 - 00:50:48.925] Guest: Like it's a science.
[00:50:48.945 - 00:50:53.654] Host: Yeah, you know, I think astrology is deeper than the show.
[00:50:53.714 - 00:50:56.018] Guest: It's a very deep subject, isn't it?
[00:50:56.038 - 00:50:57.881] Host: It's not something one should just discount.
[00:50:58.121 - 00:51:00.365] Host: Saying that this can't have an impact on you.
[00:51:00.385 - 00:51:03.250] Host: Because millionaires don't believe in astrology but billionaires do.
[00:51:03.874 - 00:51:04.695] Guest: That's right.
[00:51:04.715 - 00:51:07.179] Guest: Your community in fact.
[00:51:07.199 - 00:51:11.285] Guest: But you know the surprising thing is in my house, I believe in astrology the most.
[00:51:11.585 - 00:51:11.906] Guest: Oh really?
[00:51:11.946 - 00:51:13.188] Guest: Compared to my parents and all.
[00:51:13.208 - 00:51:15.711] Guest: My dad is like, son, beyond all this there's God.
[00:51:15.831 - 00:51:16.953] Guest: So don't worry too much.
[00:51:16.973 - 00:51:18.155] Guest: And I'm like, yeah I know that.
[00:51:18.515 - 00:51:19.417] Guest: And I agree with him.
[00:51:19.777 - 00:51:23.242] Guest: That astrology works up to one point.
[00:51:23.322 - 00:51:24.584] Guest: You know, because that's when you're born.
[00:51:24.905 - 00:51:26.607] Guest: But even after that you have your karmas.
[00:51:27.268 - 00:51:28.630] Guest: Okay, someone has one chart.
[00:51:29.151 - 00:51:31.314] Guest: After that, that person is a horrible person.
[00:51:31.970 - 00:51:33.112] Guest: So that will also affect it.
[00:51:33.673 - 00:51:37.138] Guest: Yeah, after that if a person is a lovely human being, that will also affect it.
[00:51:37.158 - 00:51:40.082] Host: I am a big Christopher Nolan fan.
[00:51:40.623 - 00:51:41.524] Host: You like Christopher Nolan?
[00:51:41.544 - 00:51:44.569] Guest: Yeah, great person to be a fan of.
[00:51:44.589 - 00:51:57.608] Host: I talked about Nolan because in his Batman series, there is a very famous dialogue that when it comes to ethics, it's not about who you are underneath, but it's your actions that define you.
[00:51:57.728 - 00:51:58.309] Guest: Absolutely.
[00:51:58.990 - 00:52:01.013] Host: Which you also said.
[00:52:01.033 - 00:52:01.714] Host: You can tell the world,
[00:52:01.890 - 00:52:04.613] Host: I am a good person, but whatever you do defines you.
[00:52:04.633 - 00:52:12.622] Guest: Yeah, and even if you see, if we read the Gita, I have read many versions of the Gita, and understanding Lord Krishna is not that easy.
[00:52:13.282 - 00:52:17.087] Guest: Because sometimes you feel like, why would he make this decision?
[00:52:17.127 - 00:52:21.351] Guest: Like, why would he say this is right, or this is right, or this is wrong?
[00:52:21.371 - 00:52:25.135] Guest: But his concept of dharma, he always keeps it at the top.
[00:52:26.097 - 00:52:31.122] Guest: So I think, again, right and wrong also is a very, very deep
[00:52:31.618 - 00:52:32.639] Guest: analysis, right?
[00:52:33.120 - 00:52:36.944] Host: Like, in this whole episode, we talked about the complex media world.
[00:52:37.045 - 00:52:40.549] Host: And here we are talking about Bhagavad Gita.
[00:52:40.569 - 00:52:41.750] Guest: I love reading the Gita.
[00:52:41.790 - 00:52:43.192] Guest: I read the Gita again and again.
[00:52:43.432 - 00:52:46.416] Guest: Because every time I read it, I learn something new.
[00:52:46.436 - 00:52:48.999] Host: For example, what happened?
[00:52:49.019 - 00:52:52.664] Guest: The biggest lesson for me is, do your work, don't worry about the results.
[00:52:52.744 - 00:52:56.228] Guest: That is the biggest, biggest lesson because it is not in your hands.
[00:52:56.368 - 00:52:57.970] Guest: You can only do your best.
[00:52:58.242 - 00:53:01.725] Guest: with a good intention, with a clean heart and just give your best, work hard.
[00:53:01.765 - 00:53:02.927] Guest: I believe a lot in hard work.
[00:53:03.247 - 00:53:06.130] Guest: You have to.
[00:53:06.450 - 00:53:10.774] Guest: So, do hard work, keep your heart clean, keep working.
[00:53:11.415 - 00:53:15.098] Guest: Whatever happens will be good and even if nothing happens, people have so much goodwill for you.
[00:53:15.899 - 00:53:18.642] Guest: And that's something I've started to realize very recently.
[00:53:19.282 - 00:53:27.090] Guest: That right now my image or my personality, especially in my industry, which is Telugu majorly,
[00:53:27.426 - 00:53:34.373] Guest: has gone beyond my films in terms of whether the film is done well or not well, it's gone beyond that to my goodwill.
[00:53:35.474 - 00:53:40.639] Guest: You know, which slowly everybody is talking about, everybody is seeing, including the audience.
[00:53:40.659 - 00:53:42.841] Guest: So I think eventually that is your earning.
[00:53:43.402 - 00:53:44.563] Guest: Your goodwill is your earning.
[00:53:45.484 - 00:53:48.707] Host: Meaning that on your deathbed, you won't have money with you.
[00:53:48.927 - 00:53:50.248] Host: But you will have people's blessings.
[00:53:50.388 - 00:53:52.390] Guest: Absolutely, I completely agree with you.
[00:53:52.410 - 00:53:53.111] Guest: You won't have money.
[00:53:54.252 - 00:53:56.114] Guest: Yeah, maximum people won't be there.
[00:53:56.674 - 00:54:03.324] Guest: And even if nobody is there, you know that I have lived my life well.
[00:54:03.424 - 00:54:04.525] Guest: I have never harmed anyone.
[00:54:04.545 - 00:54:05.326] Guest: I have done my best.
[00:54:06.088 - 00:54:08.631] Host: You are a very interesting person.
[00:54:08.651 - 00:54:09.232] Host: Yeah.
[00:54:09.432 - 00:54:11.515] Guest: Thank you.
[00:54:11.535 - 00:54:14.500] Guest: I think so because my thoughts keep me occupied a lot.
[00:54:14.800 - 00:54:16.262] Guest: So it will be interesting.
[00:54:17.825 - 00:54:19.126] Host: I am thinking what is your red flag?
[00:54:19.146 - 00:54:20.268] Guest: There is a lot.
[00:54:20.548 - 00:54:21.650] Guest: You want me to tell you?
[00:54:21.730 - 00:54:23.253] Guest: My red flag is possessiveness.
[00:54:23.813 - 00:54:24.835] Guest: Oh, nice.
[00:54:25.416 - 00:54:26.157] Guest: At least was.
[00:54:26.518 - 00:54:31.085] Guest: Maybe, I don't know, maybe that's one more lesson in life for me.
[00:54:31.426 - 00:54:32.548] Guest: Something that I'm working on.
[00:54:33.149 - 00:54:34.792] Guest: Working on my inner child like I told you.
[00:54:35.633 - 00:54:39.599] Guest: Inner child is actually very very interesting to work on and very important.
[00:54:39.760 - 00:54:42.003] Guest: I don't know why I'm working on it so late in my life.
[00:54:42.064 - 00:54:43.145] Host: Any anxious attachments, Tyler?
[00:54:44.127 - 00:54:48.434] Guest: I'm not anxious.
[00:54:48.642 - 00:54:50.624] Guest: I think my expectation is attachment style.
[00:54:51.025 - 00:54:52.907] Host: You expect a lot from your partner.
[00:54:54.168 - 00:54:54.809] Guest: I think yes.
[00:54:55.149 - 00:54:57.332] Guest: I think my expectations are a bit high.
[00:54:57.352 - 00:54:59.014] Host: Are you a clingy partner now?
[00:54:59.334 - 00:54:59.574] Guest: No.
[00:55:00.015 - 00:55:01.216] Guest: Now you are chill.
[00:55:01.316 - 00:55:04.680] Guest: I am chill but I feel that again that right and wrong thing.
[00:55:05.361 - 00:55:08.584] Guest: You know that you give what you get.
[00:55:08.925 - 00:55:11.648] Guest: I mean if I am doing this then obviously the other person will do it.
[00:55:13.029 - 00:55:17.074] Guest: Or if this is not right for me then why would that person do it.
[00:55:17.698 - 00:55:20.201] Guest: You know, I think it's not anxious or clingy.
[00:55:20.221 - 00:55:22.163] Guest: It's more of, how would I say it?
[00:55:22.283 - 00:55:23.465] Guest: It's more of moral.
[00:55:24.326 - 00:55:25.167] Guest: If that makes sense.
[00:55:28.210 - 00:55:28.751] Host: I'm curious.
[00:55:30.192 - 00:55:31.013] Host: You don't have to tell me.
[00:55:31.053 - 00:55:33.596] Host: I'm not asking what are the names.
[00:55:33.616 - 00:55:33.957] Host: No names.
[00:55:33.977 - 00:55:35.659] Host: I won't tell you.
[00:55:35.679 - 00:55:37.581] Host: What was your best relationship so far?
[00:55:37.721 - 00:55:38.362] Guest: My first one.
[00:55:39.243 - 00:55:41.205] Host: In school?
[00:55:41.225 - 00:55:41.646] Guest: Really?
[00:55:41.786 - 00:55:43.628] Guest: I think that was my best relationship.
[00:55:43.668 - 00:55:45.330] Guest: The most green flag
[00:55:45.922 - 00:55:49.005] Guest: The flag guy that I have dated was in my school.
[00:55:49.025 - 00:55:49.806] Host: Is he married?
[00:55:50.107 - 00:55:50.307] Guest: No.
[00:55:51.108 - 00:55:52.549] Guest: He is my neighbor now.
[00:55:52.750 - 00:55:53.871] Guest: But he is like my brother now.
[00:55:53.911 - 00:55:55.733] Guest: So that's not counted.
[00:55:55.873 - 00:55:56.774] Guest: That's not counted.
[00:55:57.315 - 00:56:01.600] Host: But it is said that after one point in marriage, your partner becomes like a sibling energy.
[00:56:02.400 - 00:56:03.842] Guest: But I actually agree with you.
[00:56:04.182 - 00:56:05.244] Guest: It happens.
[00:56:05.284 - 00:56:06.805] Guest: Because you become all like best friends.
[00:56:06.845 - 00:56:07.726] Guest: Your family?
[00:56:09.208 - 00:56:09.488] Guest: Buddies.
[00:56:09.508 - 00:56:10.930] Guest: And you become so comfortable.
[00:56:11.458 - 00:56:13.922] Host: But why wouldn't you go on a date with your neighbor?
[00:56:16.766 - 00:56:17.107] Host: No, I don't know.
[00:56:17.127 - 00:56:18.669] Host: Because he's not asked you out.
[00:56:18.690 - 00:56:19.090] Host: No, no.
[00:56:19.190 - 00:56:24.359] Host: If he comes up and says that, hey Nidhi, let's just explore it from a very adult perspective now.
[00:56:24.379 - 00:56:28.405] Host: As in, let's explore it from a very mature perspective now.
[00:56:28.425 - 00:56:31.650] Guest: Right now, I don't think I would be able to connect with him.
[00:56:31.670 - 00:56:33.233] Host: Because you are a different person.
[00:56:33.253 - 00:56:39.122] Guest: Because I feel like my... mentally, emotionally...
[00:56:39.330 - 00:56:43.515] Guest: The EQ we are talking about, it's really changed a lot.
[00:56:44.015 - 00:56:46.438] Guest: For me to connect with 99% of the people.
[00:56:46.798 - 00:56:48.721] Guest: Because of life?
[00:56:49.441 - 00:56:50.643] Guest: Yes, life has taught us so much.
[00:56:50.663 - 00:56:52.985] Guest: It has beaten us.
[00:56:55.048 - 00:56:56.729] Guest: It has beaten us.
[00:56:56.750 - 00:56:57.851] Host: It has given us so much.
[00:56:57.951 - 00:56:59.953] Guest: It has given us and it has beaten us.
[00:57:00.053 - 00:57:01.435] Guest: Together.
[00:57:01.535 - 00:57:01.975] Host: Together.
[00:57:02.296 - 00:57:02.776] Host: It has beaten us.
[00:57:02.796 - 00:57:04.939] Host: Every young person needs fame without understanding this.
[00:57:06.180 - 00:57:07.922] Host: The experience of fame is very good.
[00:57:08.290 - 00:57:10.232] Host: But you will get beaten up a lot.
[00:57:10.332 - 00:57:10.572] Guest: A lot.
[00:57:10.633 - 00:57:13.315] Guest: And you know something recently itself I was thinking about this.
[00:57:13.356 - 00:57:14.817] Guest: Sometimes I think about this.
[00:57:14.837 - 00:57:17.100] Guest: Why did I choose such a difficult career?
[00:57:19.022 - 00:57:19.923] Guest: I don't regret it.
[00:57:20.423 - 00:57:22.005] Guest: Okay because I love my job.
[00:57:22.185 - 00:57:25.088] Guest: But by my job I mean I love going to set.
[00:57:25.729 - 00:57:26.530] Guest: I love acting.
[00:57:26.690 - 00:57:28.172] Guest: I love talking to my director.
[00:57:28.632 - 00:57:29.833] Guest: Figuring out what to do.
[00:57:29.994 - 00:57:30.654] Guest: Doing it.
[00:57:31.275 - 00:57:33.417] Guest: My director saying it's good or it's bad.
[00:57:33.477 - 00:57:35.420] Guest: If he says it's good I'm super happy that day.
[00:57:35.800 - 00:57:37.682] Guest: And I feel like a little child you know who's
[00:57:37.794 - 00:57:41.458] Guest: got in that five star as a gift and I love that.
[00:57:42.259 - 00:57:43.161] Guest: That is my job.
[00:57:43.581 - 00:57:46.184] Guest: But the other parts of my job, I don't love that.
[00:57:46.505 - 00:57:52.151] Guest: Like I don't love the judgment, I don't love the games, I don't love the politics.
[00:57:52.852 - 00:57:55.235] Guest: But unfortunately, it's all a part of the same game.
[00:57:55.836 - 00:57:57.458] Guest: And somewhere I'm not made for that game.
[00:57:58.219 - 00:57:59.681] Guest: I am realizing that more with time.
[00:58:00.001 - 00:58:07.410] Guest: But you know, the most most interesting thing that was an eye opener for me was so I worked with Prabhas now and he is exactly like this.
[00:58:07.810 - 00:58:08.331] Unknown: Childlike.
[00:58:08.431 - 00:58:08.972] Guest: No games.
[00:58:09.893 - 00:58:10.674] Guest: No politics.
[00:58:11.496 - 00:58:13.098] Guest: No fakeness.
[00:58:13.739 - 00:58:14.300] Guest: None of that.
[00:58:15.181 - 00:58:26.518] Guest: And so I used to always think that will I ever make it big because being this soft and being this sweet and nice and oh it's okay great yeah okay done being like that.
[00:58:27.259 - 00:58:28.481] Guest: How will I make it very big?
[00:58:28.922 - 00:58:35.712] Guest: But after I met him and worked with him is when I realized he is even more childlike than me.
[00:58:35.732 - 00:58:37.234] Guest: He is even more
[00:58:37.506 - 00:58:41.231] Guest: soft and sweet and genuine and all of that than me.
[00:58:41.251 - 00:58:45.215] Guest: And if he can be today India's biggest superstar, I feel he is.
[00:58:45.876 - 00:58:51.023] Guest: So if he can be that, then maybe being like that is better, right?
[00:58:51.043 - 00:59:01.015] Host: Like, the reason I'm valuing what you're saying is, I found out after talking that your perspective is very accurate.
[00:59:01.035 - 00:59:02.417] Host: You're very observant.
[00:59:02.437 - 00:59:02.637] Host: Very much.
[00:59:02.657 - 00:59:03.538] Host: So...
[00:59:04.258 - 00:59:05.259] Guest: I can feel it.
[00:59:05.339 - 00:59:08.583] Guest: It's like I meet someone and for some reason I feel like I can feel their core.
[00:59:09.304 - 00:59:10.386] Guest: Like I can just feel it.
[00:59:10.806 - 00:59:11.627] Host: What is Prabhas' core?
[00:59:12.548 - 00:59:12.849] Guest: Pure.
[00:59:13.470 - 00:59:13.690] Host: Pure.
[00:59:13.710 - 00:59:16.353] Guest: I mean the white heart emoji.
[00:59:16.574 - 00:59:20.398] Guest: He is a very very very, he is a lovely human being.
[00:59:20.779 - 00:59:21.580] Guest: I mean he is an actor.
[00:59:21.760 - 00:59:24.303] Guest: Once you meet him, you will forget the fact that he is an actor.
[00:59:24.343 - 00:59:28.729] Guest: You will forget the fact that he has been working in this industry for the last 20-25 years.
[00:59:29.610 - 00:59:30.391] Guest: He is not like that.
[00:59:30.772 - 00:59:31.913] Guest: He is not a commercial guy.
[00:59:31.953 - 00:59:32.754] Guest: He is not
[00:59:33.090 - 00:59:34.853] Guest: He doesn't have like PR teams.
[00:59:35.514 - 00:59:39.299] Guest: He doesn't have, you know, all this politics that goes on.
[00:59:39.339 - 00:59:43.385] Guest: He's very simple and he is so...
[00:59:43.405 - 00:59:47.652] Guest: It's like meeting like a five-year-old baby, you know, meeting him.
[00:59:47.752 - 00:59:53.060] Guest: I mean, his intentions are so pure and he's so excited about films, filmmaking.
[00:59:53.801 - 00:59:57.586] Guest: So, I have like new found respect for him after working with him.
[00:59:57.967 - 01:00:02.674] Guest: The nicest person I've met in my life, not in the industry, in life.
[01:00:02.978 - 01:00:04.621] Guest: That's him.
[01:00:05.122 - 01:00:11.554] Host: I remember after Bahubali, I discovered Telugu cinema through Bahubali.
[01:00:11.814 - 01:00:13.598] Host: And I speak for many other Indians.
[01:00:14.499 - 01:00:18.106] Host: I started reading up about Prabhas.
[01:00:18.627 - 01:00:21.733] Host: And I came to know that he had a 20 year long career.
[01:00:21.753 - 01:00:24.498] Host: Then he became Bahubali.
[01:00:24.642 - 01:00:29.710] Host: And here we keep crying for 3 years, 5 years, 10 years of career.
[01:00:29.730 - 01:00:30.992] Host: That we are tired and jaded.
[01:00:31.213 - 01:00:34.177] Host: But it took 20 years for one Bahubali.
[01:00:34.257 - 01:00:36.281] Host: And now we are having these conversations about it.
[01:00:36.661 - 01:00:39.266] Host: But in 20 years of journey, he kept his heart clean.
[01:00:39.486 - 01:00:40.948] Guest: He kept his heart clean?
[01:00:40.968 - 01:00:41.569] Guest: Absolutely.
[01:00:41.669 - 01:00:45.355] Guest: And even before Bahubali, there was 5 years of shooting just for that film.
[01:00:45.976 - 01:00:48.641] Guest: Physically very very very taxing.
[01:00:49.462 - 01:00:51.986] Guest: And I think not doing any other films.
[01:00:52.418 - 01:00:57.025] Guest: What people see is one thing, but the internal journey also of an actor is a whole other story.
[01:00:57.526 - 01:01:00.972] Guest: Only when you talk to them, you'll understand what they go through at that point of time.
[01:01:01.453 - 01:01:04.758] Guest: And the biggest thing is when Bahubali released, the first day there was flop talk.
[01:01:05.419 - 01:01:06.541] Guest: They were like, it's a disaster.
[01:01:06.581 - 01:01:07.042] Host: Why?
[01:01:07.062 - 01:01:13.572] Guest: It took people a while for them to accept the film, to understand it and to celebrate it like the way they did.
[01:01:13.893 - 01:01:15.796] Guest: But on the first day, the judgement was disaster.
[01:01:16.096 - 01:01:19.602] Guest: So imagine that after working for five years, sacrificing everything,
[01:01:19.938 - 01:01:22.782] Guest: Waking up the next morning and seeing that okay it's all gone for a waste.
[01:01:23.824 - 01:01:24.725] Guest: And then it picks up.
[01:01:24.745 - 01:01:27.870] Guest: So just imagine the roller coaster for that person mentally.
[01:01:28.991 - 01:01:31.695] Guest: You know those 48 hours or those 4 days.
[01:01:31.936 - 01:01:34.119] Guest: It's a roller coaster, right?
[01:01:34.139 - 01:01:36.102] Host: Do you think he is also detached from the results?
[01:01:36.462 - 01:01:39.106] Guest: I think he is very detached from the results.
[01:01:39.146 - 01:01:41.830] Guest: And I am slowly seeing that his way is the right way.
[01:01:42.291 - 01:01:44.534] Guest: You know because he does his job, he gives his best.
[01:01:44.855 - 01:01:47.238] Host: I feel that this career anxiety feels to everyone.
[01:01:47.299 - 01:01:47.779] Host: Gen Z's.
[01:01:47.799 - 01:01:48.761] Host: I feel it a lot.
[01:01:48.861 - 01:01:49.682] Guest: All of us feel it.
[01:01:49.954 - 01:01:54.341] Host: The only way to handle that is the core Gita lesson.
[01:01:54.521 - 01:01:57.325] Host: Just give your efforts 100% and don't care about the fruit.
[01:01:57.465 - 01:01:58.767] Guest: Because everything has a time.
[01:01:58.988 - 01:02:00.470] Guest: And I've realized this.
[01:02:00.870 - 01:02:04.636] Guest: When it's the right time, you don't do anything and everything works out for you.
[01:02:04.977 - 01:02:11.667] Guest: But when it is the wrong time, Ranveer, you can get heaven and earth together and nothing will work out.
[01:02:12.708 - 01:02:13.029] Host: It's time.
[01:02:13.529 - 01:02:13.970] Host: You know,
[01:02:14.242 - 01:02:20.931] Host: And even in saying that, even in the wrong times, when you give even more effort, I feel on some level, the effort is registered somewhere.
[01:02:21.051 - 01:02:21.312] Guest: It is.
[01:02:21.592 - 01:02:22.233] Guest: I agree with you.
[01:02:22.673 - 01:02:24.356] Guest: It doesn't have to come in that.
[01:02:24.756 - 01:02:25.878] Guest: The result will come somewhere.
[01:02:25.898 - 01:02:27.079] Guest: But nothing goes for waste.
[01:02:27.580 - 01:02:28.141] Guest: Good and bad.
[01:02:28.682 - 01:02:30.184] Host: Bringing little philosophy into this.
[01:02:30.204 - 01:02:31.165] Host: Please do.
[01:02:31.365 - 01:02:37.453] Host: You know, there's this quote that goes, we're not human beings having a spiritual experience, but spiritual beings having a human experience.
[01:02:38.014 - 01:02:38.635] Guest: Interesting.
[01:02:39.236 - 01:02:43.762] Host: When, on a human level, I know this thing about just putting in efforts and not
[01:02:44.002 - 01:02:44.903] Host: thinking about the results.
[01:02:46.045 - 01:02:47.166] Host: It can be tough to sustain.
[01:02:47.227 - 01:02:48.769] Host: Then you have to turn to philosophy.
[01:02:49.390 - 01:02:50.191] Host: Then that gets you through.
[01:02:51.573 - 01:02:53.575] Host: Just know that you are temporarily.
[01:02:53.595 - 01:03:05.292] Host: I have had so many spiritual people on the show where they have said things like, everyone thinks that at the point of death you go to heaven and there is an astral world.
[01:03:05.893 - 01:03:09.618] Host: But to see that moment, one more perspective is that
[01:03:09.890 - 01:03:15.259] Host: At the moment of death, you get to know that that human experience was a dream.
[01:03:15.279 - 01:03:16.100] Guest: This is reality.
[01:03:16.761 - 01:03:16.982] Guest: True.
[01:03:17.623 - 01:03:19.646] Guest: And the thing is we will never know this.
[01:03:19.786 - 01:03:21.950] Guest: We will never get the answers to this.
[01:03:22.430 - 01:03:27.278] Guest: You know when I was younger, when I was like, I think my Saturn period came in my childhood.
[01:03:27.298 - 01:03:28.480] Host: Saturn, Mahadashtra.
[01:03:28.500 - 01:03:29.542] Guest: Yes, it came in my childhood.
[01:03:29.562 - 01:03:31.986] Guest: So that is the point where I became a vegetarian.
[01:03:32.258 - 01:03:36.862] Guest: I used to be a non-vegetarian randomly like a 8 year old kid just deciding to become vegetarian.
[01:03:37.323 - 01:03:40.246] Guest: Also that has something to do with Dalai Lama but I'll tell you that.
[01:03:40.566 - 01:03:43.409] Guest: So his sister used to live in my old building.
[01:03:43.549 - 01:03:48.834] Guest: Dalai Lama sister and she used to give me a chocolate every day that orange candy with a transparent wrapper.
[01:03:49.234 - 01:03:53.419] Guest: Every day like all the kids used to be playing and she used to call me and she used to give me that every single day.
[01:03:54.239 - 01:04:01.106] Guest: And in that period I think a lot of things happened in my life I suddenly started to become very mature in my thinking.
[01:04:01.858 - 01:04:05.782] Guest: I was thinking like a 30 year old at the age of 8.
[01:04:05.942 - 01:04:09.165] Guest: I started having existential crisis questions.
[01:04:09.645 - 01:04:12.048] Guest: Like what is the point of living if one day I'm gonna die?
[01:04:12.608 - 01:04:13.289] Guest: What is the point?
[01:04:15.070 - 01:04:18.374] Guest: I mean for an 8 year old kid to think that is not really normal.
[01:04:19.975 - 01:04:21.476] Guest: That turning vegetarian.
[01:04:21.937 - 01:04:22.638] Guest: Lot of things.
[01:04:23.318 - 01:04:25.100] Guest: So what was I talking about?
[01:04:25.180 - 01:04:26.521] Guest: I completely went off track.
[01:04:27.162 - 01:04:28.243] Host: Saturn.
[01:04:29.004 - 01:04:31.666] Guest: So because that came in my childhood I think these
[01:04:31.970 - 01:04:40.501] Guest: thought, this whole thought process, way of life, um, accepting hard work, accepting these kinds of concepts started very, very early on in my life.
[01:04:40.521 - 01:04:44.906] Guest: So Saturn, number eight, all of these things have really taught me.
[01:04:46.348 - 01:04:47.750] Guest: August 17th.
[01:04:50.453 - 01:04:50.733] Host: Wow.
[01:04:50.793 - 01:04:52.496] Host: There's like a lot of Saturn.
[01:04:54.057 - 01:04:55.019] Host: Are you bogged down by it?
[01:04:55.559 - 01:05:00.946] Guest: No, I think Saturn has taught me the most important and most
[01:05:01.314 - 01:05:23.851] Guest: beautiful lessons very early on in my life where I didn't have to wait for my 30s or 40s to learn them and at a very very young age I saw the reality of people the just reality you know how people behave when you're you have a good Friday how people behave and you have a bad Friday so I think I've seen all of that now.
[01:05:25.473 - 01:05:28.338] Host: Would you like to be born again?
[01:05:29.858 - 01:05:33.602] Guest: I wouldn't want to be born again.
[01:05:33.882 - 01:05:34.122] Host: No?
[01:05:34.342 - 01:05:35.083] Host: No.
[01:05:35.363 - 01:05:37.825] Host: I'm trying my best to make this my last life.
[01:05:38.826 - 01:05:41.229] Host: If what we learn as Hindu kids is true.
[01:05:41.529 - 01:05:42.150] Host: Which I think it is.
[01:05:42.470 - 01:05:43.951] Guest: I also feel it is somewhere.
[01:05:44.512 - 01:05:47.274] Guest: I feel you can attain moksha, nirvana, whatever it is.
[01:05:47.334 - 01:05:47.955] Guest: I think you can.
[01:05:47.995 - 01:05:51.158] Guest: And actually, maybe not.
[01:05:51.658 - 01:05:54.441] Guest: I used to be very, very scared of death when I was younger.
[01:05:55.242 - 01:05:56.883] Guest: I was like petrified of it.
[01:05:56.923 - 01:05:58.505] Guest: Because that existential thing, right?
[01:05:58.525 - 01:05:59.666] Guest: Then what's the point?
[01:05:59.842 - 01:06:01.003] Guest: Why am I working so hard?
[01:06:01.203 - 01:06:01.844] Guest: Why am I here?
[01:06:01.904 - 01:06:03.105] Guest: Why am I talking to anybody?
[01:06:03.145 - 01:06:05.387] Guest: If one day I'm going to be gone, then what?
[01:06:05.407 - 01:06:06.468] Guest: What will happen after that?
[01:06:06.629 - 01:06:08.130] Host: You know, we were speaking about Rajarshi Nandi.
[01:06:08.150 - 01:06:09.972] Host: So, I've done so many episodes with him.
[01:06:09.992 - 01:06:11.834] Host: It always feels like reading a new book.
[01:06:12.394 - 01:06:14.876] Host: Because he's got that kind of knowledge and he channelizes something.
[01:06:14.896 - 01:06:15.217] Guest: He's great.
[01:06:15.257 - 01:06:19.020] Guest: I've seen your podcast with him and that man has something special in him.
[01:06:19.801 - 01:06:24.686] Host: He mentioned a word in one of the first episodes that's related to what we're talking about.
[01:06:24.706 - 01:06:27.128] Host: I think the word is mumutsu if I'm not mistaken.
[01:06:27.148 - 01:06:29.010] Host: Mumukshu or mumutsu.
[01:06:29.218 - 01:06:44.009] Host: It basically means a soul that gets so tired of all these material games that it cries out to the divine saying that please just take me away from this whole material world.
[01:06:44.890 - 01:06:48.338] Host: And that's when your real ferocious spiritual journey starts.
[01:06:49.360 - 01:06:50.482] Host: So I think
[01:06:51.106 - 01:06:55.071] Host: fame, riches, everything is just to push you to that point of becoming a momo.
[01:06:55.211 - 01:06:55.732] Host: Probably.
[01:06:55.772 - 01:06:57.054] Host: It feels like it.
[01:06:57.855 - 01:07:01.279] Host: There's no money and no fame that can actually feel nice.
[01:07:02.381 - 01:07:04.684] Guest: I think after a point, that's what happens, right?
[01:07:04.864 - 01:07:08.288] Guest: It's like when a person is not maybe rich, they want to earn.
[01:07:08.549 - 01:07:09.670] Guest: They know the importance of money.
[01:07:09.690 - 01:07:10.651] Guest: You want to earn, earn, earn.
[01:07:10.671 - 01:07:17.100] Guest: But after a certain point, how much ever money you have, post that one mark of money, it doesn't matter.
[01:07:17.620 - 01:07:18.962] Guest: Because your lifestyle is the same.
[01:07:19.042 - 01:07:20.543] Guest: Your expenses, everything is the same.
[01:07:20.924 - 01:07:22.666] Guest: It's the same thing with fame, I think.
[01:07:23.567 - 01:07:27.631] Host: I want to tell you something related to this, I'm sorry I interrupted you.
[01:07:27.771 - 01:07:28.732] Host: No, that's okay.
[01:07:29.653 - 01:07:35.478] Host: Sorry, I'm not talking to you as a woman, I'm just talking to you as a spiritual being here.
[01:07:35.498 - 01:07:40.483] Host: But in your life as a woman, especially a famous woman who looks the way you do.
[01:07:40.503 - 01:07:43.526] Host: I'm sure you get a lot of attention from a lot of guys.
[01:07:43.546 - 01:07:44.948] Host: And a lot of them are billionaire guys.
[01:07:46.990 - 01:07:47.090] Unknown: Okay?
[01:07:47.394 - 01:07:51.538] Host: Why don't you choose them on a spiritual level?
[01:07:51.558 - 01:07:52.379] Guest: I think...
[01:07:53.480 - 01:07:56.282] Guest: So, first of all, I'll just give you some context.
[01:07:57.463 - 01:07:59.746] Guest: I've always been a heroine in my mind.
[01:08:00.126 - 01:08:04.650] Guest: Which is why, seriously, in my school also, I was always a heroine in my head.
[01:08:04.930 - 01:08:09.114] Guest: Which is why I think my behavior, my thought process about myself has never changed.
[01:08:09.555 - 01:08:10.496] Guest: That now I'm good.
[01:08:11.196 - 01:08:12.698] Guest: In my head, I was always good.
[01:08:13.038 - 01:08:14.059] Guest: If you see it, good.
[01:08:14.099 - 01:08:15.180] Guest: If you don't see it, your loss.
[01:08:15.600 - 01:08:17.362] Guest: I've always had that kind of a...
[01:08:17.986 - 01:08:20.829] Guest: thinking about myself, which is whatever.
[01:08:20.869 - 01:08:21.951] Guest: But yeah, that's what it is.
[01:08:22.551 - 01:08:27.457] Guest: So I've always thought that attention has always been given to boys.
[01:08:28.338 - 01:08:33.944] Guest: And I feel that one thing I don't like at all is show-off.
[01:08:35.126 - 01:08:37.489] Guest: I think that's the first thing that puts me off.
[01:08:38.450 - 01:08:45.618] Guest: I can't, I really can't handle people who show off because
[01:08:46.434 - 01:08:46.814] Guest: I don't know.
[01:08:46.855 - 01:08:47.896] Guest: It doesn't sit well with me.
[01:08:48.457 - 01:08:50.419] Guest: I feel like, just keep gratitude.
[01:08:50.439 - 01:08:51.060] Guest: You got lucky.
[01:08:51.100 - 01:08:51.921] Guest: We all got lucky.
[01:08:52.341 - 01:08:54.144] Host: What is the attractive personality trait?
[01:08:56.687 - 01:08:57.328] Guest: Sincerity.
[01:08:57.828 - 01:08:58.649] Host: Authenticity.
[01:08:58.669 - 01:09:00.171] Guest: Authenticity, sincerity.
[01:09:00.852 - 01:09:04.497] Guest: In boys, I would say, for me, it would be stability and dependability.
[01:09:05.217 - 01:09:08.321] Guest: I think that's something that would really attract me to a person.
[01:09:08.442 - 01:09:12.667] Guest: And a good hearted human would instantly attract me.
[01:09:13.107 - 01:09:13.408] Guest: You know.
[01:09:13.668 - 01:09:15.250] Host: Because actually,
[01:09:15.682 - 01:09:20.949] Host: The deepest love basically means you'll need to live with that person in the same room for 100 years of your life.
[01:09:21.429 - 01:09:21.770] Guest: Yeah.
[01:09:22.350 - 01:09:29.439] Guest: So it's about the silence, it's about being calm and I always think with your partner, it's someone you need to be able to make life decisions with.
[01:09:30.581 - 01:09:38.130] Guest: Like from the smallest to the biggest, from a decision of where to live to a ventilator decision.
[01:09:38.530 - 01:09:43.457] Guest: I mean, from the smallest to the biggest decision with that one person you have to make.
[01:09:43.477 - 01:09:46.200] Guest: So are you able to decide anything with that person?
[01:09:47.182 - 01:09:49.345] Guest: You know, is it possible to talk to this person?
[01:09:49.465 - 01:09:52.829] Guest: Is it possible for this person to understand things from your perspective as well?
[01:09:53.711 - 01:09:55.513] Guest: That I feel is very, very important.
[01:09:56.695 - 01:09:58.597] Host: Can I tell you a very random tangent?
[01:09:58.798 - 01:10:00.880] Host: But it's related to human relationships.
[01:10:00.900 - 01:10:03.224] Host: Ask Devima.
[01:10:03.244 - 01:10:05.166] Guest: I actually... Shivji.
[01:10:05.186 - 01:10:07.890] Guest: Shivji, a lot and Hanumanji.
[01:10:08.162 - 01:10:09.243] Guest: Very much.
[01:10:09.263 - 01:10:11.226] Guest: I mean Hanuman Ji is my...
[01:10:11.246 - 01:10:12.467] Guest: I love Hanuman Ji.
[01:10:12.487 - 01:10:13.508] Host: Show me your wallpaper again.
[01:10:13.528 - 01:10:15.591] Host: You can just show it to the camera.
[01:10:15.631 - 01:10:18.234] Guest: So outside is... Hanuman Ji.
[01:10:18.254 - 01:10:21.018] Guest: This has been my wallpaper for like 15 years now.
[01:10:21.278 - 01:10:23.541] Guest: I have not even changed the colors, photo, nothing.
[01:10:23.841 - 01:10:24.742] Host: Look to your left.
[01:10:26.744 - 01:10:29.248] Guest: Hanuman Ji is right here.
[01:10:29.268 - 01:10:31.791] Guest: But you know, I will tell you one more story about Hanuman Ji.
[01:10:31.931 - 01:10:33.413] Guest: And inside is Shiv Ji.
[01:10:33.653 - 01:10:34.013] Unknown: Oh wow!
[01:10:34.334 - 01:10:36.376] Guest: Poetic.
[01:10:36.536 - 01:10:37.938] Guest: Poetic, isn't it?
[01:10:38.018 - 01:10:44.005] Guest: But Hanumanji, I think before I get on any important stage, I always say Jai Hanuman in my mind.
[01:10:44.205 - 01:10:49.111] Guest: Before I get on any place where I'm a bit nervous, I just say Jai Hanuman and I'm good.
[01:10:49.532 - 01:10:54.538] Guest: Hanuman Chalisa is always with me because I'm very petrified of like ghosts.
[01:10:54.838 - 01:10:59.143] Guest: I think my biggest fear in life is what if I hear something or what if I see something?
[01:10:59.163 - 01:11:00.805] Guest: You know, I get a heart attack.
[01:11:00.865 - 01:11:01.746] Guest: I can't handle it.
[01:11:01.922 - 01:11:04.144] Guest: So, Hanuman Chalisa is always with me.
[01:11:04.284 - 01:11:05.886] Guest: I say the Hanuman Chalisa every day.
[01:11:05.906 - 01:11:08.388] Guest: I go to the Hanuman Mandir very often.
[01:11:08.449 - 01:11:11.211] Guest: And I love Hanuman Ji.
[01:11:11.331 - 01:11:16.016] Guest: I think Hanuman Ji has really literally saved me in so many situations.
[01:11:16.336 - 01:11:19.039] Host: Even as an adult, a successful adult.
[01:11:19.099 - 01:11:19.880] Guest: Yes, 100%.
[01:11:20.000 - 01:11:20.721] Guest: More.
[01:11:20.741 - 01:11:21.001] Guest: Yeah.
[01:11:21.421 - 01:11:25.165] Guest: And somehow every film that I am doing has some connection with Hanuman Ji.
[01:11:25.946 - 01:11:29.970] Guest: Yeah, like the last director I worked with, his name is Maruti.
[01:11:30.210 - 01:11:34.437] Guest: There is some connection always with Hanuman Ji with every film that I do.
[01:11:34.517 - 01:11:37.682] Host: I don't know what that is.
[01:11:38.363 - 01:11:39.164] Host: Feel it saved you?
[01:11:39.905 - 01:11:40.907] Guest: I feel it has saved me.
[01:11:41.047 - 01:11:43.511] Guest: Yeah, Hanuman Ji has really saved me.
[01:11:43.531 - 01:11:50.482] Host: I think I would have been swimming in a pool of drugs and sadness if I didn't have my religion.
[01:11:51.202 - 01:11:53.365] Guest: I can completely empathize with that.
[01:11:54.086 - 01:12:00.555] Host: With how crazy our industry is and you see so many drug-infused stories and infidelity and all these things.
[01:12:01.115 - 01:12:02.137] Host: I feel religion is that anchor.
[01:12:02.357 - 01:12:03.478] Host: Call it what you want.
[01:12:03.599 - 01:12:03.919] Guest: It is.
[01:12:03.939 - 01:12:04.360] Guest: You know what?
[01:12:04.380 - 01:12:05.802] Guest: Religion is not a bad word.
[01:12:05.882 - 01:12:10.067] Guest: I feel like people just take it in a different context.
[01:12:10.127 - 01:12:16.015] Host: In the West, religion is like a battle of modernism versus ancient thoughts.
[01:12:16.035 - 01:12:19.600] Host: The thing is, how do you explain what we feel as Sanat?
[01:12:19.620 - 01:12:21.042] Host: We look at it as a philosophy.
[01:12:21.186 - 01:12:28.036] Host: Now the world calls Hinduism Sanatana Dharma a religion and they club it with what the context of the world religion is in the West.
[01:12:28.437 - 01:12:32.262] Guest: Yeah, but my question is what is the problem with Sanatana Dharma?
[01:12:33.344 - 01:12:39.132] Guest: It talks about having a healthy lifestyle, eating Satvic food, doing certain practices that are only good for you.
[01:12:39.833 - 01:12:42.337] Guest: So physically, mentally, emotionally, it's good for you.
[01:12:42.357 - 01:12:43.599] Guest: So what's the problem in that?
[01:12:43.619 - 01:12:46.002] Host: The thing is, I think when you're following it,
[01:12:46.306 - 01:12:51.533] Host: And when you educate yourself with human intent as a subject, that just be a kind person to everyone.
[01:12:52.094 - 01:12:53.155] Host: We see it as a philosophy.
[01:12:53.576 - 01:12:57.401] Host: But the fact that we're discussing it makes it a religious oriented conversation.
[01:12:57.421 - 01:12:59.945] Host: And then lots of people switch off to it, which is fine.
[01:13:00.405 - 01:13:02.348] Host: Their souls are not supposed to find these conversations.
[01:13:02.368 - 01:13:02.889] Guest: I think so.
[01:13:02.949 - 01:13:03.710] Guest: It's eventually that.
[01:13:03.750 - 01:13:05.893] Guest: Their journey is just a different kind of journey.
[01:13:05.913 - 01:13:07.495] Guest: Their soul journey, I'm talking about.
[01:13:07.515 - 01:13:10.579] Host: I have to tell you that dark thing.
[01:13:10.619 - 01:13:11.521] Guest: Dark thing, please.
[01:13:13.183 - 01:13:15.506] Host: So...
[01:13:15.810 - 01:13:22.858] Host: I met a relative recently, he's a very good or high level doctor in the US.
[01:13:22.878 - 01:13:27.042] Host: He said that there's a new field of medicine, which is a very ethically important field.
[01:13:27.823 - 01:13:28.083] Host: Okay.
[01:13:28.103 - 01:13:34.550] Host: But you need to listen about it from a slightly mature perspective.
[01:13:34.570 - 01:13:35.712] Host: It's called euthanology.
[01:13:36.152 - 01:13:36.753] Guest: Okay.
[01:13:37.774 - 01:13:45.362] Host: So there's a word called euthanasia, which is kinda related to euthanology, but it's not
[01:13:45.506 - 01:13:46.167] Host: Euthanology.
[01:13:47.128 - 01:13:57.183] Host: So euthanasia is when if an animal is very unwell and you know you can't save the animal, then you'll put it to sleep like a dog or a cat.
[01:13:57.203 - 01:14:00.548] Host: But the same rule applies to human beings.
[01:14:01.049 - 01:14:07.238] Host: If they cannot be saved, if they're in that vegetable state, sometimes they're given euthanasia to just be kinder with them.
[01:14:08.560 - 01:14:09.642] Host: So that's what euthanasia is.
[01:14:11.304 - 01:14:13.908] Host: That's where the word comes from.
[01:14:13.928 - 01:14:15.090] Host: Now here's what euthanology is.
[01:14:15.714 - 01:14:24.447] Host: So up till very recently, maybe pre-COVID, the world treated older people in this manner.
[01:14:24.467 - 01:14:26.931] Host: So if you fall ill as an older person, you go to a hospital.
[01:14:27.712 - 01:14:32.119] Host: Say if you've got some very big illness, pneumonia, you'll be given medicines to save you.
[01:14:33.221 - 01:14:36.385] Host: But then when you recover, you're living a lower quality of life.
[01:14:36.646 - 01:14:39.590] Host: And you're probably living with suffering, your lungs have got damaged, all that.
[01:14:39.891 - 01:14:44.658] Host: And then each disease damages you in its own way at that age, if you're 90 years old, if you're 95.
[01:14:45.826 - 01:14:56.556] Host: Euthanology is a specialized branch of medicine where doctors are trained to take away the suffering from an old person when they are highly unwell.
[01:14:57.417 - 01:15:05.184] Host: So if you've got pneumonia and you go to a euthanologist, they'll give you medicines to reduce your pain, to make it easier, to make it more gentle.
[01:15:06.185 - 01:15:09.088] Host: But they don't give you the medicines to fully save your life.
[01:15:09.529 - 01:15:12.892] Guest: Okay, so they don't treat it, they just reduce your pain basically.
[01:15:12.912 - 01:15:13.773] Host: To take away your suffering.
[01:15:13.793 - 01:15:15.154] Guest: To take away the suffering, okay.
[01:15:15.426 - 01:15:18.270] Host: And this is becoming a very common thing in the West.
[01:15:18.811 - 01:15:23.178] Host: But it's very difficult for Indian families currently to understand and accept this.
[01:15:23.198 - 01:15:26.103] Host: Because everyone lives with their grandparents.
[01:15:26.123 - 01:15:29.668] Host: And grandparents are also usually of two types.
[01:15:30.329 - 01:15:32.353] Host: But they're mostly of the second type.
[01:15:32.373 - 01:15:35.437] Host: The first is the ones that want to hold on to family life etc.
[01:15:35.458 - 01:15:43.410] Host: But when you become old enough, but once you hit a certain age and you're suffering that much just because of old age,
[01:15:43.682 - 01:15:47.608] Host: Lots of people want to move into the next phase of their soul's journey.
[01:15:48.229 - 01:15:50.814] Host: Which is what Indian culture tells you about.
[01:15:52.036 - 01:15:57.364] Host: So it's a very difficult topic to explain youth and knowledge to Indian families.
[01:15:58.186 - 01:16:03.094] Host: But there's a new age protocol, which is that the second generation.
[01:16:03.114 - 01:16:08.403] Host: So if people our age have grandparents, our parents' generation were like 50, 60, 70 now.
[01:16:08.923 - 01:16:10.546] Host: Need to have a family meeting.
[01:16:10.690 - 01:16:13.934] Host: and figure if they want to apply a euthanologist in their own family.
[01:16:13.954 - 01:16:16.677] Guest: Exactly, I think that would be the best possible way to do that.
[01:16:16.697 - 01:16:24.047] Host: But it's become a new age issue and everyone our age, the dark reality is that we'll have to do this for our parents also at some point.
[01:16:24.287 - 01:16:25.749] Guest: Oh my God, I can't even imagine.
[01:16:26.970 - 01:16:29.673] Host: That was the dark angle.
[01:16:30.735 - 01:16:36.562] Host: I don't remember how we reached euthanology, but it's something that I was thinking about
[01:16:36.930 - 01:16:41.536] Host: from a very like ethical perspective because some people will look at this as an unethical thing, look at this as murder but it's not.
[01:16:42.497 - 01:16:44.179] Guest: Yeah, I mean I don't think it is.
[01:16:44.800 - 01:16:47.043] Guest: I think it's...
[01:16:47.063 - 01:17:00.500] Guest: I mean see these are all very very subjective you know things to each person has a diff... it's like God or love you know there's no one right or wrong thing it's just everyone has a different definition or a different expectation of it but I feel it's not wrong.
[01:17:01.261 - 01:17:05.106] Guest: I feel if you have like a meeting with your family and
[01:17:05.602 - 01:17:08.525] Guest: the person decides how they would want to eventually end their life.
[01:17:08.605 - 01:17:10.207] Guest: I think it's in a way better.
[01:17:10.888 - 01:17:18.897] Host: Yeah, I think, you know, the reason that meeting is required is because different personalities react differently to the concept of death.
[01:17:19.378 - 01:17:23.422] Host: Like you'll have some uncle or aunt who's very sensitive to death.
[01:17:23.442 - 01:17:26.666] Host: They immediately look at this as a painful subject.
[01:17:27.187 - 01:17:29.610] Host: And another person who looks at death as just the next stage.
[01:17:29.650 - 01:17:30.450] Guest: As a part of life.
[01:17:31.031 - 01:17:33.554] Guest: Ironically, yeah.
[01:17:35.202 - 01:17:36.243] Host: I remember how we reached it.
[01:17:36.263 - 01:17:38.546] Host: We reached it because we were talking about selecting a life partner.
[01:17:39.728 - 01:17:45.695] Host: And especially for people in our age group, our lifespans are likely going to be longer than normal.
[01:17:45.915 - 01:17:48.338] Host: So you're selecting someone for the next 120 years of your life.
[01:17:48.518 - 01:17:48.999] Guest: 120 years?
[01:17:49.119 - 01:17:51.001] Guest: Oh great, I have 120 years of life.
[01:17:51.021 - 01:17:52.243] Guest: I mean ideally.
[01:17:53.004 - 01:17:53.304] Guest: Great.
[01:17:53.404 - 01:17:55.647] Host: If longevity really takes off.
[01:17:57.009 - 01:18:04.658] Host: But yeah, and you need to select a partner based on the possibility of hardcore conversations like euthanology.
[01:18:04.770 - 01:18:11.119] Guest: Yeah, I mean first of all selecting a partner is the most important decision of your life.
[01:18:11.580 - 01:18:14.063] Guest: Because that one decision will either make you or break you.
[01:18:14.564 - 01:18:20.312] Guest: You know, it will give you a life full of happiness or a life full of loneliness maybe, I don't know.
[01:18:21.454 - 01:18:22.936] Guest: And also it's the only decision.
[01:18:22.956 - 01:18:24.017] Host: Life full of loneliness.
[01:18:24.078 - 01:18:25.259] Guest: It could, you know.
[01:18:25.600 - 01:18:29.025] Guest: And also think about it Ranveer, it's the only decision that you make.
[01:18:29.045 - 01:18:30.026] Guest: You don't choose your parents.
[01:18:30.647 - 01:18:32.850] Guest: I mean, maybe in some way you do but
[01:18:33.218 - 01:18:35.141] Guest: To our mind, you know, you don't choose your parents.
[01:18:35.522 - 01:18:36.403] Guest: You don't choose your kids.
[01:18:37.305 - 01:18:38.947] Guest: You have to choose just that one person.
[01:18:39.608 - 01:18:41.031] Guest: That you have to make the right choice.
[01:18:43.475 - 01:18:44.977] Host: Let's go back to your green flags.
[01:18:45.017 - 01:18:48.443] Host: Are you single now?
[01:18:48.463 - 01:18:48.943] Host: Yes.
[01:18:49.264 - 01:18:49.705] Host: Single?
[01:18:49.745 - 01:18:50.065] Host: Single.
[01:18:50.246 - 01:18:53.070] Host: But very ready for marriage if the right person comes?
[01:18:54.432 - 01:18:54.673] Guest: Yeah.
[01:18:55.614 - 01:18:56.696] Guest: I think yeah.
[01:18:56.716 - 01:19:00.402] Guest: I see myself married like we've discussed and
[01:19:00.802 - 01:19:02.564] Guest: Maybe I need a little bit of time.
[01:19:02.724 - 01:19:03.625] Guest: Maybe a couple of months.
[01:19:03.645 - 01:19:06.988] Guest: I would also like to get to know the person who I'm going to get married to.
[01:19:07.409 - 01:19:08.850] Guest: So that also would take some time.
[01:19:09.390 - 01:19:10.692] Guest: What are the tests?
[01:19:11.272 - 01:19:11.993] Guest: Tests.
[01:19:12.013 - 01:19:16.958] Guest: There was a test in a barfi where the lampshade falls and she doesn't move.
[01:19:17.198 - 01:19:18.740] Guest: So my tests are of that type.
[01:19:18.780 - 01:19:23.745] Guest: It's like if you're crossing the road and the other person is just not bothered about you.
[01:19:24.405 - 01:19:26.067] Guest: It's the smallest things.
[01:19:26.607 - 01:19:29.170] Guest: Have you seen this one video of an old couple
[01:19:29.410 - 01:19:34.740] Guest: the lady is bending down and the old man is sitting and he just puts his hand there so that she doesn't hit her head on the table.
[01:19:35.561 - 01:19:46.882] Guest: I think my tests are very like that because it's the micro moments in life you know that really tell you a person's character and whether that person will be there for you or not.
[01:19:47.503 - 01:19:53.554] Guest: Because at a good time when you're young and everything is great but you know you are gonna get older
[01:19:53.698 - 01:19:55.961] Guest: You are going to need help at some point of time.
[01:19:56.001 - 01:20:02.309] Guest: Your partner is going to see you in the most ugly situations, phases, faces possible.
[01:20:03.190 - 01:20:14.664] Guest: So, yeah, it has to go beyond physicality and beyond, yeah, like society and work and level and success and status.
[01:20:14.724 - 01:20:16.106] Guest: It has to go beyond all of that.
[01:20:16.907 - 01:20:17.828] Host: Yeah.
[01:20:20.591 - 01:20:22.994] Host: I think when you are marrying someone,
[01:20:23.650 - 01:20:26.054] Host: Marrying with the energy of the heart, not with their face.
[01:20:26.074 - 01:20:26.394] Host: Absolutely.
[01:20:26.614 - 01:20:34.266] Guest: And with their potential, with their family, with their karma, with their everything.
[01:20:34.887 - 01:20:41.597] Guest: You know, you're literally because you are going to have kids with that person and you're literally going to merge your souls together.
[01:20:41.637 - 01:20:43.680] Guest: So you have to be...
[01:20:43.700 - 01:20:46.003] Guest: I mean, we don't even touch a dirty thing.
[01:20:46.023 - 01:20:51.752] Guest: But you don't know how clean or dirty somebody's soul is, their past is, their intentions are.
[01:20:51.992 - 01:20:53.394] Host: How do you find out so quickly?
[01:20:54.018 - 01:21:00.688] Guest: I think these are such big things but it's not even the small things, it's the micro things.
[01:21:01.249 - 01:21:05.916] Guest: You know the micro expressions, the micro intentions, the micro reactions.
[01:21:06.617 - 01:21:10.543] Guest: I think it's that and a lot of it is to do with a person's parents.
[01:21:11.905 - 01:21:16.332] Guest: Because I really believe that you are a sum of your parents in a way.
[01:21:16.853 - 01:21:19.877] Guest: I mean I see that with myself as well and with most people around me.
[01:21:20.478 - 01:21:22.962] Guest: So I would really want to choose someone who has
[01:21:23.394 - 01:21:24.896] Guest: brought up their child really well.
[01:21:25.637 - 01:21:27.139] Guest: That's very, very important.
[01:21:27.720 - 01:21:30.965] Host: There's a quote that goes, this is a quote I really love.
[01:21:31.485 - 01:21:32.307] Host: It's a quote about marriage.
[01:21:33.228 - 01:21:41.820] Host: It goes that marriage is a lifelong process of healing each other's wounded inner child.
[01:21:42.441 - 01:21:43.122] Host: But it's lifelong.
[01:21:43.810 - 01:21:44.771] Guest: That's actually true.
[01:21:44.791 - 01:21:49.156] Host: And the stuff that got wounded in the childhood will heal in the late stages of your marriage.
[01:21:49.176 - 01:21:49.957] Host: When you're 60, 70.
[01:21:49.977 - 01:21:53.581] Host: That's what you're signing up for at 30ish.
[01:21:54.582 - 01:21:56.224] Guest: So choose a less wounded child.
[01:21:57.165 - 01:21:58.647] Host: Wounded inner child.
[01:21:58.887 - 01:22:02.151] Host: I think everyone's wounded.
[01:22:03.032 - 01:22:03.733] Guest: I agree with you.
[01:22:03.773 - 01:22:08.538] Guest: I mean even people who've had the most beautiful childhoods and upbringing have wounds.
[01:22:08.899 - 01:22:11.602] Host: You know the thing is based on what I've noticed
[01:22:11.970 - 01:22:16.535] Host: beautiful childhoods and upbringings often can wound you in your 20s and 30s.
[01:22:16.895 - 01:22:18.016] Host: So everyone gets wounded.
[01:22:18.036 - 01:22:26.124] Host: The harsh truth is that your own life's victories are kind of happening because of those big complexes you carry.
[01:22:26.624 - 01:22:28.506] Guest: I actually agree with that as well.
[01:22:29.047 - 01:22:32.710] Guest: Somewhere the validation, you need validation from so many people.
[01:22:32.771 - 01:22:35.113] Host: The ego required to keep going.
[01:22:35.533 - 01:22:36.895] Host: The ego is coming from the wounds.
[01:22:37.856 - 01:22:38.116] Guest: It is.
[01:22:38.576 - 01:22:40.338] Guest: It absolutely is.
[01:22:40.738 - 01:22:43.382] Host: loosely based on what I've read and learned.
[01:22:43.722 - 01:22:46.106] Guest: I feel like the... Raneen, I'm surprised.
[01:22:46.586 - 01:22:47.968] Guest: Like you're really...
[01:22:49.350 - 01:22:51.914] Host: I talk to a subject like that every day.
[01:22:52.535 - 01:23:03.090] Guest: Yeah, but you've really, really got this to the T. When you said this last thing of it's these wounds that actually make you maybe ambitious, a lot of positive things that come
[01:23:03.394 - 01:23:05.476] Guest: in your life are somewhere also because of this?
[01:23:05.936 - 01:23:07.918] Host: You know like what is drive at the end of the day?
[01:23:07.938 - 01:23:09.160] Guest: Yeah, like why ambition?
[01:23:09.600 - 01:23:09.800] Guest: Why?
[01:23:10.000 - 01:23:11.282] Host: It's a chase to fill up a wound.
[01:23:12.923 - 01:23:15.446] Host: What's your wound?
[01:23:15.466 - 01:23:17.147] Host: Why have you pushed so hard?
[01:23:18.889 - 01:23:22.192] Guest: I think with me, it's not about validation.
[01:23:22.913 - 01:23:24.414] Guest: It's really not about that.
[01:23:24.675 - 01:23:25.255] Guest: I feel...
[01:23:25.996 - 01:23:27.898] Guest: I think it would just come down to love with me.
[01:23:29.399 - 01:23:30.260] Guest: Wanting love?
[01:23:30.440 - 01:23:32.242] Guest: Yeah, I feel like I...
[01:23:32.802 - 01:23:39.131] Guest: Maybe I need to give myself a little bit more love, which is what I've figured out with the last few months of self-work that I've been doing.
[01:23:39.151 - 01:23:44.938] Guest: I really need to give myself love, not the vanity care that I do.
[01:23:44.958 - 01:23:49.805] Guest: I do take good care of myself, but I mean self-love, unconditional self-love.
[01:23:51.327 - 01:23:57.095] Host: You know, my mom's a gynecologist and I was talking to her about what pregnancy feels like as a mom.
[01:23:57.115 - 01:23:58.697] Host: What does she understand about pregnancy?
[01:23:58.717 - 01:23:59.378] Host: She says that.
[01:23:59.778 - 01:24:00.959] Host: There are two things.
[01:24:01.120 - 01:24:05.504] Host: One, any doctor of any kind has experienced the divine at play in their work.
[01:24:05.665 - 01:24:08.768] Host: If you work for like 20-30 years, you know that there's some miracles that happen.
[01:24:09.929 - 01:24:12.432] Host: And childbirth is one of those biggest miracles.
[01:24:12.813 - 01:24:20.241] Host: The second thing she said is when there's an embryo in your womb, it could even be with a surrogate mother.
[01:24:20.862 - 01:24:27.289] Host: The embryo releases stem cells into the woman's bloodstream and heals the woman in parts that she doesn't know about.
[01:24:27.309 - 01:24:28.370] Host: Physically and emotionally.
[01:24:28.450 - 01:24:29.751] Guest: So nice.
[01:24:30.031 - 01:24:34.576] Host: So pregnancy shifts a lot, especially for the mom.
[01:24:34.596 - 01:24:37.779] Host: For the dad, it's like a lot of responsibility and all that.
[01:24:37.799 - 01:24:40.381] Host: But it's biological for the mom.
[01:24:40.401 - 01:24:41.702] Guest: I had, I didn't know about this.
[01:24:41.783 - 01:24:42.283] Guest: Interesting.
[01:24:42.323 - 01:24:43.444] Guest: So it heals you in ways.
[01:24:43.464 - 01:24:47.007] Host: You're probably on a deeper level than just biological also.
[01:24:47.027 - 01:24:47.128] Guest: Yeah.
[01:24:47.148 - 01:24:47.248] Unknown: Yeah.
[01:24:47.268 - 01:24:47.468] Guest: Yeah.
[01:24:47.768 - 01:24:49.250] Guest: Energetic level, soul level.
[01:24:49.830 - 01:24:52.653] Host: I was just, sorry, I just had this conversation like 12 hours ago.
[01:24:52.933 - 01:24:53.734] Host: So that's why it's fresh.
[01:24:53.774 - 01:24:58.258] Guest: But how lovely, because usually you think of pregnancy as something that's very difficult for
[01:24:58.722 - 01:24:59.643] Guest: the mother, right?
[01:24:59.663 - 01:25:02.346] Guest: Like physically, because of the hormonal changes and everything.
[01:25:02.366 - 01:25:04.049] Guest: But this is a beautiful way to look at that.
[01:25:05.390 - 01:25:08.254] Host: Just asking you as a woman, do you look forward to being pregnant?
[01:25:08.694 - 01:25:10.016] Guest: Yes, I do.
[01:25:10.336 - 01:25:12.259] Guest: Because I'm clear that I want to have kids.
[01:25:13.801 - 01:25:17.085] Guest: How, if I think of it, I think I would want it to be through me.
[01:25:17.225 - 01:25:22.131] Guest: I mean, it's great that people are doing other procedures, IVFs and that whole thing.
[01:25:22.151 - 01:25:25.475] Guest: I'm not very sure on the terms, but I think that's amazing as well.
[01:25:25.775 - 01:25:28.018] Guest: But I think I would want to have it though.
[01:25:29.410 - 01:25:29.891] Guest: Like me.
[01:25:30.592 - 01:25:39.166] Host: I know it will be a journey, but... Like as a man, when you're born in a male body, it's very hard to empathize.
[01:25:39.186 - 01:25:40.248] Guest: How is it, Ranveer?
[01:25:40.268 - 01:25:40.769] Guest: Tell me.
[01:25:40.789 - 01:25:41.891] Host: To be born in a male body?
[01:25:42.652 - 01:25:44.415] Guest: Fantastic.
[01:25:44.435 - 01:25:45.156] Guest: How is it fantastic?
[01:25:45.176 - 01:25:45.837] Host: It's actually great.
[01:25:45.857 - 01:25:51.346] Host: And the more you get to learn about girls' bodies, the more you figure that, oh, thank God.
[01:25:51.682 - 01:25:53.764] Host: Like girls' bodies are complex.
[01:25:54.025 - 01:25:54.826] Guest: They are complex.
[01:25:54.926 - 01:25:55.867] Guest: It's like a cocktail.
[01:25:55.887 - 01:25:59.351] Guest: Someone was telling me a guy's body is like a neat drink.
[01:25:59.371 - 01:26:00.692] Guest: Girl's body is like a cocktail.
[01:26:01.173 - 01:26:01.413] Guest: You know?
[01:26:01.713 - 01:26:04.396] Guest: It has a lot of hormones and a lot of these things.
[01:26:05.097 - 01:26:09.222] Host: I think a guy's emotional body is way more messed up though.
[01:26:09.242 - 01:26:10.243] Guest: Okay, interesting.
[01:26:10.283 - 01:26:11.444] Host: That's there for sure.
[01:26:11.824 - 01:26:15.068] Host: Because I think a girl's biological body has the ability to give life.
[01:26:15.789 - 01:26:17.571] Host: Okay, so that's why it's a more complex system.
[01:26:18.952 - 01:26:20.434] Host: But for whatever reason,
[01:26:20.706 - 01:26:24.772] Host: girls are able to emotionally regulate way better than men.
[01:26:25.473 - 01:26:32.203] Host: But like for example, as an early 30s man, I know you know KL Rahul from Bangalore.
[01:26:32.223 - 01:26:33.425] Host: I keep talking to KL about this.
[01:26:34.347 - 01:26:44.442] Host: As you turn 30 as a guy and he's a sports person, you become very conscious of your body degrading and that affects you emotionally.
[01:26:44.943 - 01:26:49.810] Host: It starts happening at like 28-29 and then at 30-31 some switch happens.
[01:26:50.242 - 01:26:52.484] Host: This is why athletes kind of start trailing off.
[01:26:53.425 - 01:26:55.627] Host: So I'd ask him that how are you dealing with this whole thing?
[01:26:55.647 - 01:26:58.230] Host: He's like it's there but it's something you have to handle psychologically.
[01:26:58.250 - 01:26:59.111] Guest: Psychologically, yeah.
[01:26:59.131 - 01:27:01.293] Host: And he's in one of the best phases of his career right now.
[01:27:01.313 - 01:27:02.114] Host: Yeah, he is.
[01:27:02.134 - 01:27:02.534] Host: Love KL.
[01:27:02.715 - 01:27:03.015] Guest: Yeah.
[01:27:03.495 - 01:27:04.276] Guest: Me too, he's lovely.
[01:27:05.197 - 01:27:10.422] Host: I want to talk about KL a little bit to you because I'd seen him, I'd seen both of you mention each other in interviews way back.
[01:27:10.482 - 01:27:10.883] Guest: Yeah.
[01:27:10.923 - 01:27:12.084] Host: You'll know each other before fame.
[01:27:12.104 - 01:27:15.507] Guest: Yeah, so I, exactly, I've known him before he became a cricketer.
[01:27:15.567 - 01:27:18.130] Guest: He's known me before I've become an actor from Bangalore.
[01:27:18.242 - 01:27:26.190] Guest: I mean we weren't like really good friends but we knew each other and then we happened to meet in Bombay and it was just nice to see a familiar face.
[01:27:26.811 - 01:27:44.348] Guest: It was nice to know that okay fine I know someone here who's known me from before who doesn't just know this version of me but they know that I've always been like this and I'm trying to figure my way out and I'm sure it was the same for him and I'm so proud of him I think he's really it's very very difficult to make it.
[01:27:44.808 - 01:27:46.450] Host: Both of you are very poised people.
[01:27:46.786 - 01:27:47.607] Guest: Bangalore maybe?
[01:27:48.248 - 01:27:49.729] Host: Yeah, it's Bangalore energy.
[01:27:49.749 - 01:27:52.132] Host: I call it Rahul Dravid energy.
[01:27:52.232 - 01:27:55.055] Guest: In Bangalore everyone loves Rahul Dravid.
[01:27:55.075 - 01:27:57.737] Guest: Rahul Dravid is like loved by everyone.
[01:27:58.338 - 01:27:59.699] Host: Nikhil Kamath same category.
[01:27:59.719 - 01:28:01.341] Guest: Nikhil Kamath as well.
[01:28:01.541 - 01:28:01.982] Guest: Yeah.
[01:28:02.122 - 01:28:08.969] Guest: And I think Bangalore people just have this little bit of a chilled out energy where they're ambitious but they're not desperate in any way.
[01:28:10.130 - 01:28:10.731] Guest: Non-judging.
[01:28:10.911 - 01:28:12.933] Guest: Yeah, that just comes across.
[01:28:12.993 - 01:28:13.714] Host: Yeah.
[01:28:14.018 - 01:28:16.641] Host: Back to some intense topic we were speaking about.
[01:28:16.742 - 01:28:23.631] Guest: Male, like after the age of 30, you know, you start to... That's what the trials of having a male body are like.
[01:28:23.871 - 01:28:26.755] Host: I've had some andrologists on the show.
[01:28:27.596 - 01:28:29.198] Host: Guys have a really tough time in their old age.
[01:28:29.999 - 01:28:31.561] Host: Like there's 2-3 issues that come up.
[01:28:31.741 - 01:28:33.143] Host: Is it the hormonal?
[01:28:33.243 - 01:28:34.705] Host: Yeah, it's hormones, prostate.
[01:28:35.206 - 01:28:38.290] Host: And you know, when you're a teenager,
[01:28:38.530 - 01:28:42.776] Host: your hormones are through the roof and your body is like a muscle building machine.
[01:28:42.796 - 01:28:44.399] Guest: Yeah, recovery is at its peak.
[01:28:44.419 - 01:28:49.306] Host: You're able to digest food and put on muscle strength very quickly.
[01:28:49.666 - 01:28:52.571] Host: And you see a degradation of that in your early thirties.
[01:28:52.591 - 01:28:53.192] Host: It's the reverse.
[01:28:53.392 - 01:28:55.335] Guest: So mentally it's difficult to accept.
[01:28:55.715 - 01:28:58.079] Host: Yeah, it's a very deep form of humbling that happens.
[01:28:58.760 - 01:29:02.846] Host: Like you start, it really shifts your perspective.
[01:29:02.866 - 01:29:06.611] Host: And parallelly you see your career becoming easier in your thirties.
[01:29:06.651 - 01:29:08.434] Host: So it really makes you read
[01:29:08.578 - 01:29:09.859] Host: align a lot of stuff.
[01:29:10.060 - 01:29:14.765] Host: But that's the only challenge that I have encountered in 32 years of biological life.
[01:29:14.785 - 01:29:21.913] Host: Girls, from the time you get periods till the time you have a pregnancy, after that, it's always like some menopause.
[01:29:21.933 - 01:29:23.255] Guest: There's something or the other.
[01:29:23.976 - 01:29:29.522] Guest: I feel like with women, I actually feel like you're at your peak from like 28-29.
[01:29:30.003 - 01:29:36.210] Guest: I feel like you look your best, you feel your best, your decisions are very
[01:29:36.290 - 01:29:38.073] Guest: are much better than what they used to be.
[01:29:38.133 - 01:29:39.836] Guest: You feel emotionally much more stronger.
[01:29:39.856 - 01:29:41.399] Guest: You come into your own as a person.
[01:29:41.980 - 01:29:42.961] Guest: I feel by like 28.
[01:29:43.081 - 01:29:50.995] Guest: And somewhere you're not scared you know at that age to like piss people off or rub them the wrong way.
[01:29:51.015 - 01:29:54.981] Guest: Like you're just like this is what I feel and this is how I think and for me this is what it is.
[01:29:55.342 - 01:29:56.664] Guest: You start becoming very clear.
[01:29:57.666 - 01:29:57.966] Guest: You know.
[01:29:58.367 - 01:30:02.514] Host: Every girl our age is thinking about either pregnancy, egg freezing,
[01:30:03.106 - 01:30:06.269] Guest: I mean, yeah, my mom and I have had that conversation as well.
[01:30:06.309 - 01:30:07.851] Guest: You know, about egg freezing.
[01:30:07.891 - 01:30:09.472] Guest: I think it's a great idea.
[01:30:09.492 - 01:30:10.493] Guest: It's a great option.
[01:30:10.673 - 01:30:15.898] Guest: And you know, Ranveer, the thing is with women, I feel like the hormones and everything is one thing.
[01:30:15.919 - 01:30:16.819] Guest: Okay, you can deal with that.
[01:30:16.859 - 01:30:27.550] Guest: But the most complicated thing is the age where you're peaking in your career and the age to get married and have babies is like intertwining.
[01:30:27.650 - 01:30:28.651] Guest: It's the same age.
[01:30:29.211 - 01:30:31.794] Guest: And then you reach a point where it's very confusing.
[01:30:32.130 - 01:30:35.454] Guest: You know, you're like, okay, because it's not like you can just have a baby.
[01:30:35.474 - 01:30:36.656] Guest: You need to have the baby.
[01:30:36.676 - 01:30:37.797] Guest: You need to take care of it.
[01:30:37.857 - 01:30:44.366] Guest: And to avoid a deeply wounded inner child of your child, you need to be there for your child.
[01:30:45.087 - 01:30:46.829] Guest: You know, it's so important.
[01:30:47.269 - 01:30:48.651] Host: I mean, high EQ speaking.
[01:30:48.871 - 01:30:49.132] Guest: Yeah.
[01:30:49.172 - 01:30:55.440] Guest: Because the more I'm learning about inner child, I'm learning about how important those first six to eight years of life are.
[01:30:55.640 - 01:31:00.306] Guest: And everything is formed, you know, within that age.
[01:31:00.706 - 01:31:04.331] Guest: So my mom is calling me.
[01:31:04.351 - 01:31:05.513] Guest: I haven't spoken to her in three days.
[01:31:05.533 - 01:31:07.876] Guest: She's going to yell at me when I pick up.
[01:31:07.896 - 01:31:10.579] Guest: But interesting timing for her to call me now.
[01:31:11.260 - 01:31:13.584] Guest: But anyway, so...
[01:31:13.604 - 01:31:14.285] Unknown: Right?
[01:31:15.146 - 01:31:20.072] Guest: But yeah, those first six to eight years are so important.
[01:31:21.354 - 01:31:24.959] Host: You either say I'm unwounded or highly healed.
[01:31:25.860 - 01:31:27.242] Guest: Highly healed, I think it would be.
[01:31:27.302 - 01:31:28.063] Guest: Unwounded, I don't...
[01:31:28.143 - 01:31:30.066] Guest: I've had lovely...
[01:31:30.402 - 01:31:40.457] Guest: But you know, I think somewhere I've always, like I told you, I think this whole Saturn thing coming in my childhood has somewhere made me become very mature at a very young age.
[01:31:40.978 - 01:31:44.763] Guest: So I feel like I've never been very, very childlike.
[01:31:45.845 - 01:31:49.170] Guest: That very childish thing has never really been there.
[01:31:49.190 - 01:31:50.351] Guest: I'm also the older sibling.
[01:31:50.371 - 01:31:55.819] Guest: So I've always been very responsible, very correct, very calm, poised, composed, strong.
[01:31:55.839 - 01:31:57.262] Host: Has someone ever dumped you?
[01:31:57.963 - 01:31:58.363] Guest: Dumped?
[01:31:59.365 - 01:32:00.306] Guest: Umm...
[01:32:00.898 - 01:32:04.783] Guest: I mean, no, I haven't been dumped, but I have been cheated on.
[01:32:04.803 - 01:32:07.507] Guest: If that's counted as dumped indirectly, that's dumped.
[01:32:08.188 - 01:32:09.409] Guest: So yeah, I have been cheated on.
[01:32:09.469 - 01:32:10.731] Guest: Was your partner famous?
[01:32:11.252 - 01:32:15.016] Guest: No, that was before the... Before your fame.
[01:32:15.057 - 01:32:15.637] Guest: Before my fame.
[01:32:15.657 - 01:32:16.078] Guest: You got cheated on.
[01:32:16.098 - 01:32:16.979] Guest: Yeah, I got cheated on.
[01:32:16.999 - 01:32:17.380] Guest: As a teenager?
[01:32:17.620 - 01:32:18.401] Guest: As a teenager.
[01:32:18.521 - 01:32:23.007] Guest: And it was so difficult for me to understand the concept because I'm like, but why?
[01:32:24.709 - 01:32:26.752] Guest: Because you're very logical, right?
[01:32:26.772 - 01:32:28.434] Guest: You're like, if you're with me,
[01:32:28.514 - 01:32:29.175] Guest: Why would you?
[01:32:29.215 - 01:32:30.177] Guest: Then don't be with me.
[01:32:30.297 - 01:32:32.480] Guest: So you can't understand the concept of it.
[01:32:32.680 - 01:32:34.683] Guest: I was traveling.
[01:32:34.703 - 01:32:36.446] Guest: I was not in the country.
[01:32:37.047 - 01:32:37.628] Guest: I was traveling.
[01:32:37.668 - 01:32:42.175] Guest: So I think I was in Australia or something for a while and yeah.
[01:32:42.255 - 01:32:44.478] Guest: But that wasn't like a serious relationship anyway.
[01:32:44.498 - 01:32:49.045] Guest: So I don't think it really hurt me or it really I was heartbroken.
[01:32:49.185 - 01:32:53.572] Guest: I don't think I've actually been very heartbroken earlier on in my life.
[01:32:55.014 - 01:32:57.458] Guest: It was like a whatever relationship.
[01:32:57.570 - 01:32:58.351] Guest: Nothing serious.
[01:32:59.432 - 01:33:01.494] Host: Let me introduce you to the average marriage market.
[01:33:02.195 - 01:33:06.319] Host: There's a lot of people, Marwadi boys out there.
[01:33:06.339 - 01:33:08.481] Guest: Yeah, I think so.
[01:33:09.061 - 01:33:11.604] Host: But you've never dated anyone that you felt like marrying?
[01:33:13.165 - 01:33:18.150] Guest: Um, not before, maybe some time ago.
[01:33:18.250 - 01:33:18.571] Guest: Yeah.
[01:33:18.971 - 01:33:21.113] Guest: Some one person was one, just one.
[01:33:21.954 - 01:33:24.696] Guest: But again, no, no, actually, no, I haven't.
[01:33:26.178 - 01:33:26.258] Unknown: Hmm.
[01:33:27.234 - 01:33:28.856] Host: Have you told your parents you're open to arrange marriage?
[01:33:31.438 - 01:33:33.140] Guest: I mean, they've asked me many times.
[01:33:33.760 - 01:33:35.782] Guest: I've always been saying that, okay, we'll see.
[01:33:35.803 - 01:33:36.103] Guest: We'll see.
[01:33:36.123 - 01:33:36.824] Guest: Give me some time.
[01:33:36.964 - 01:33:37.764] Guest: Give me another year.
[01:33:37.805 - 01:33:38.465] Guest: Give me another year.
[01:33:38.485 - 01:33:39.746] Guest: So I've been taking that one year.
[01:33:39.766 - 01:33:39.847] Unknown: Why?
[01:33:40.667 - 01:33:43.090] Guest: Because I don't know.
[01:33:43.210 - 01:33:46.233] Guest: I just feel like marriage is something that just needs to happen.
[01:33:46.954 - 01:33:51.498] Guest: You know, you just need to meet someone and feel like, okay, I think this person would be a great life partner.
[01:33:52.139 - 01:33:55.442] Guest: As much as there's love and this and that and all of that, I agree.
[01:33:55.522 - 01:33:58.669] Guest: But it has to be like a well-made, good decision.
[01:33:58.709 - 01:34:00.052] Guest: You know?
[01:34:00.633 - 01:34:02.276] Guest: You can't just go with love, I feel.
[01:34:02.296 - 01:34:03.439] Guest: You need to decide.
[01:34:04.962 - 01:34:06.986] Host: Should go to Banaras and ask for it.
[01:34:07.006 - 01:34:11.356] Guest: Go to Kashi and pray, God, please bring a good proposal for me.
[01:34:11.376 - 01:34:14.041] Host: Shivji, send someone like you.
[01:34:14.061 - 01:34:14.923] Guest: Yeah, Shivji.
[01:34:15.023 - 01:34:16.306] Guest: How beautiful would that be?
[01:34:16.354 - 01:34:19.057] Host: I see that with a lot of girls our age.
[01:34:19.157 - 01:34:21.259] Host: A lot of Shiv Shakti Bhakti.
[01:34:21.799 - 01:34:21.939] Guest: Yeah.
[01:34:22.300 - 01:34:24.902] Guest: You know, I had this dialogue in one film also.
[01:34:24.942 - 01:34:28.266] Guest: It was a Telugu dialogue.
[01:34:28.626 - 01:34:30.708] Guest: Which means I want a guy like Lord Ram.
[01:34:30.728 - 01:34:31.949] Unknown: Oh wow.
[01:34:32.029 - 01:34:33.090] Guest: Nice.
[01:34:33.150 - 01:34:37.114] Guest: So I think somewhere, maybe let's manifest that.
[01:34:38.155 - 01:34:38.536] Guest: You know.
[01:34:40.137 - 01:34:41.559] Host: You definitely need an Indian guy.
[01:34:42.620 - 01:34:45.042] Guest: You know something, for some reason I am
[01:34:45.762 - 01:34:53.275] Guest: I mean some foreigners, they look great and everything is great but I can't imagine myself with a foreigner.
[01:34:53.796 - 01:34:54.497] Guest: I don't know why.
[01:34:54.517 - 01:34:56.580] Guest: I think I'm too desi.
[01:34:58.323 - 01:34:59.365] Host: That's one aspect.
[01:34:59.385 - 01:35:06.597] Host: I also feel that if you're an Indian and if you're an artist, there's too much philosophy already in your head.
[01:35:07.218 - 01:35:09.362] Host: It's highly Indian and you need to match that.
[01:35:09.602 - 01:35:11.824] Host: frequency with another Indian person.
[01:35:11.844 - 01:35:14.147] Guest: Yeah, like I just don't feel it otherwise.
[01:35:14.547 - 01:35:16.149] Guest: I think I need an Indian boy.
[01:35:16.249 - 01:35:21.094] Host: How would you explain this Ramji ka angle to some American dude?
[01:35:22.396 - 01:35:28.502] Host: Like just, you know, it's too layered Indian dharm and all this.
[01:35:29.223 - 01:35:30.445] Host: What did you like about Banaras?
[01:35:31.265 - 01:35:32.527] Guest: I loved the energy there.
[01:35:32.647 - 01:35:35.810] Guest: I think, so I stayed in this hotel called Bridge something.
[01:35:35.850 - 01:35:37.813] Guest: It's on the ghats.
[01:35:37.833 - 01:35:39.154] Guest: So I had actually gone there for shoot.
[01:35:39.458 - 01:35:41.520] Guest: I shot for this film called Ismat Shankar De.
[01:35:42.321 - 01:35:44.423] Guest: And so, oh my God, I didn't tell you this.
[01:35:44.463 - 01:35:49.228] Guest: So I went to the temple and that was the first time my mom joined me at a shoot.
[01:35:49.248 - 01:35:50.149] Guest: So she came for a day.
[01:35:50.229 - 01:35:52.292] Guest: My parents never come to my shoot ever.
[01:35:53.433 - 01:35:55.375] Guest: I guess they get bored or something.
[01:35:55.775 - 01:35:57.597] Guest: So they never accompany me or anything.
[01:35:57.617 - 01:35:59.740] Guest: But I had called her because I wanted to do the darshan.
[01:35:59.860 - 01:36:01.922] Guest: And I just went and I just prayed.
[01:36:01.942 - 01:36:05.746] Guest: And I was like, God, if this film doesn't work, I will leave.
[01:36:06.498 - 01:36:12.506] Guest: But if I'm meant to stay in this industry as an actor, show me a sign with the result of this film.
[01:36:13.047 - 01:36:17.213] Guest: And that film became a huge blockbuster, unexpectedly.
[01:36:17.874 - 01:36:22.300] Guest: No one thought that film would become this huge, but it became a huge blockbuster.
[01:36:22.801 - 01:36:25.845] Guest: So I was like, okay, maybe that's my sign to stay then.
[01:36:26.325 - 01:36:27.968] Guest: Because I was like, this is my answer.
[01:36:28.428 - 01:36:29.610] Guest: If this doesn't work, I'm out.
[01:36:30.071 - 01:36:31.072] Guest: If this works, I'll stay.
[01:36:31.172 - 01:36:32.594] Host: Do you remember which Mandir you went to?
[01:36:33.474 - 01:36:38.941] Guest: I went to the Kashi Vishwana temple, did the Abhishek there in the morning, Abhishekam they say in South.
[01:36:39.401 - 01:36:42.165] Guest: So I did that in the morning and that was when I also hit my head.
[01:36:44.207 - 01:36:47.491] Guest: So there was this temple that I had to go into and the wall was really low.
[01:36:47.972 - 01:36:53.939] Guest: So I just got up and I just hit my head so badly that there were just like hot tears coming down.
[01:36:54.399 - 01:36:56.902] Guest: I couldn't even react, it was just instant.
[01:36:57.423 - 01:37:03.090] Guest: But after that, my entire perspective on life, on God,
[01:37:03.234 - 01:37:06.698] Guest: spirituality, myself, completely changed.
[01:37:06.979 - 01:37:09.201] Guest: You know, there's one thing they say about number eight, right?
[01:37:09.842 - 01:37:10.783] Guest: So this is number eight.
[01:37:11.124 - 01:37:14.829] Guest: But they say when you become spiritual, it becomes infinity.
[01:37:15.509 - 01:37:18.814] Guest: So I think that's what happened to me in Kashi.
[01:37:19.394 - 01:37:21.076] Guest: That eight just became infinity.
[01:37:22.218 - 01:37:24.260] Host: You had to go through that pain as a karmic cleanse.
[01:37:24.441 - 01:37:27.404] Guest: I think so because that was really painful.
[01:37:27.424 - 01:37:28.786] Guest: It was stone.
[01:37:28.930 - 01:37:30.452] Guest: And it was right here.
[01:37:30.933 - 01:37:32.014] Host: It was in Kashi Vishwanath?
[01:37:32.034 - 01:37:33.075] Guest: It was in Kashi Vishwanath.
[01:37:33.095 - 01:37:34.237] Host: That's a good thing.
[01:37:34.397 - 01:37:36.059] Host: Then I don't feel bad for you.
[01:37:36.159 - 01:37:39.704] Host: I always feel bad for you, but it's fine.
[01:37:39.744 - 01:37:40.705] Host: Life became nice after that.
[01:37:40.725 - 01:37:43.509] Guest: Life became very very different after that.
[01:37:43.669 - 01:37:45.271] Guest: I think I stopped...
[01:37:45.932 - 01:37:48.455] Guest: So I'm very detached from results in my life.
[01:37:48.736 - 01:37:50.057] Guest: Also my Ketu time is going on.
[01:37:50.838 - 01:37:56.786] Guest: So that's gotten some great lessons for me as well.
[01:37:57.026 - 01:38:06.898] Guest: So, I have seemingly become very detached from people, from results, from everything.
[01:38:07.960 - 01:38:10.903] Guest: Yeah, I'm just becoming more and more detached, I think, from things.
[01:38:12.205 - 01:38:16.430] Host: You know, because this theme has come up again, I'm gonna take away a tangent that's in my head.
[01:38:17.091 - 01:38:20.876] Host: So, in the last two days, there was this one clip that went viral of Shubh Mangil.
[01:38:22.458 - 01:38:26.002] Host: Shubh Mangil is like India's new superstar.
[01:38:26.434 - 01:38:31.261] Host: And he's recently been dropped from one of our three teams, the T20 team.
[01:38:32.223 - 01:38:40.656] Host: Now as the media in India sometimes does its thing, in a press conference, he was questioned about being dropped.
[01:38:40.676 - 01:38:41.597] Host: Hey man, how do you feel?
[01:38:41.958 - 01:38:42.679] Guest: How will you feel?
[01:38:42.719 - 01:38:46.104] Host: His response was so nice.
[01:38:46.145 - 01:38:52.274] Host: He repeated the same lesson that we've spoken about, but sometimes you just need that pop culture figure to repeat it.
[01:38:52.482 - 01:38:53.283] Host: to remind yourself.
[01:38:53.423 - 01:38:55.746] Host: And I messaged him saying, bro loved this.
[01:38:56.166 - 01:39:05.897] Host: He said that, hey, I am giving my 100% all the time and I know that what's in my destiny can't be taken away from me.
[01:39:06.798 - 01:39:11.304] Host: And that's why I'm okay with it because I'm putting in my 100% effort and I'm confident in my own life.
[01:39:11.604 - 01:39:13.606] Guest: Very mature, very well said.
[01:39:13.626 - 01:39:15.568] Guest: That's my captain.
[01:39:15.989 - 01:39:17.010] Host: That's the Indian captain.
[01:39:17.762 - 01:39:18.383] Guest: Absolutely.
[01:39:18.543 - 01:39:19.205] Guest: I agree with you.
[01:39:19.245 - 01:39:20.427] Guest: You need that mindset.
[01:39:20.848 - 01:39:27.340] Guest: And I also feel like people, like even the audience, everybody, needs to always look at things as a whole.
[01:39:27.360 - 01:39:30.166] Guest: You don't look at today, today, today, today, today.
[01:39:30.386 - 01:39:31.729] Guest: Today is yesterday, tomorrow.
[01:39:32.751 - 01:39:35.716] Guest: It's not just about ye film chal gayi, ye mad jeet.
[01:39:35.736 - 01:39:36.538] Guest: It's not that.
[01:39:37.259 - 01:39:40.786] Guest: You see the greatest of the greatest people who have lived
[01:39:41.186 - 01:39:46.191] Guest: on this planet, you know, the most famous people who have lived, they've all had a journey of ups and downs.
[01:39:46.612 - 01:39:48.033] Guest: It's not just up and up and up.
[01:39:48.133 - 01:39:49.395] Guest: No one's life is like that.
[01:39:50.136 - 01:39:57.644] Guest: You know, so even on top, the person is as talented, even at their lowest, that same person is as talented.
[01:39:58.024 - 01:40:01.528] Guest: So talent has nothing to do with where you are in life.
[01:40:01.928 - 01:40:11.058] Host: Yeah, you know, there's this lesson that I think I learned fairly late as a media professional and helped me out with this because I know you'll get what I'm saying, but
[01:40:11.362 - 01:40:12.946] Host: if I'm articulating it correctly.
[01:40:14.028 - 01:40:20.142] Host: So, social media engagement has become a bit of a metric, especially in our world as content creators.
[01:40:20.202 - 01:40:21.465] Host: How many views?
[01:40:23.490 - 01:40:27.058] Host: But the thing is, now take a step back.
[01:40:27.842 - 01:40:33.189] Host: And when we were growing up in India in the 90s and 2000s, there were so many superstars.
[01:40:33.449 - 01:40:36.934] Host: You go on their social media stuff, they are not getting that much engaged.
[01:40:36.974 - 01:40:37.655] Guest: No, they are not.
[01:40:37.675 - 01:40:39.277] Host: They can be like 10k, 15k likes.
[01:40:39.437 - 01:40:42.141] Host: I also think again even that's an up and down journey.
[01:40:42.461 - 01:40:45.105] Host: And eventually you'll be remembered for your decades of work.
[01:40:45.445 - 01:40:45.906] Host: Absolutely.
[01:40:45.926 - 01:40:48.249] Host: If being remembered interests you as a concept.
[01:40:48.950 - 01:40:50.452] Guest: Again, yeah.
[01:40:50.472 - 01:40:55.218] Host: Because I've also noticed that everyone who obsesses over legacy ends up in sadness.
[01:40:55.906 - 01:40:57.287] Host: Everyone goes, Oh, I want to build a legacy.
[01:40:57.468 - 01:41:00.511] Host: I see this with athletes, actors, just chill out and work.
[01:41:00.691 - 01:41:01.111] Guest: I don't know.
[01:41:01.191 - 01:41:03.834] Guest: I feel like nowadays it's not possible to build a legacy.
[01:41:03.894 - 01:41:07.498] Guest: I mean, I could be wrong, but everything is so temporary.
[01:41:07.938 - 01:41:10.020] Guest: It's just news is two days.
[01:41:10.941 - 01:41:13.404] Guest: Anything sticks around for two days and then they forget about it.
[01:41:13.964 - 01:41:18.929] Guest: You know, a person's career, whatever, like a film or a great win is remembered for like a week.
[01:41:19.650 - 01:41:20.251] Guest: And then it's done.
[01:41:21.632 - 01:41:23.634] Host: Have you ever.
[01:41:23.746 - 01:41:26.248] Host: had a conversation like this with Pawan Kalyan sir?
[01:41:26.549 - 01:41:28.170] Guest: Oh my God, Pawan Kalyan sir.
[01:41:28.551 - 01:41:34.837] Guest: So he, I have to say, first of all let me give you some backstory about him.
[01:41:34.857 - 01:41:36.458] Guest: He is a phenomenon.
[01:41:37.379 - 01:41:37.619] Guest: Right?
[01:41:37.659 - 01:41:39.902] Guest: Like he is equivalent to God.
[01:41:40.342 - 01:41:42.744] Guest: In Andhra, in Telangana.
[01:41:43.125 - 01:41:44.206] Guest: Like equivalent to God.
[01:41:44.566 - 01:41:48.310] Guest: The kind of craze that he has is unmatched.
[01:41:48.710 - 01:41:49.731] Guest: Like it's unparalleled.
[01:41:49.971 - 01:41:52.754] Guest: And I realized that when I was working with him,
[01:41:52.834 - 01:41:56.319] Guest: The moment people came to know I'm working with him, they all were like, do well, huh?
[01:41:56.519 - 01:41:58.041] Guest: You're working with our God and everything.
[01:41:58.061 - 01:41:59.443] Guest: And I was like, okay, great, I will.
[01:41:59.784 - 01:42:00.565] Guest: I'll try my best.
[01:42:00.925 - 01:42:02.428] Guest: But he's such an intelligent man.
[01:42:03.008 - 01:42:04.510] Guest: He is so...
[01:42:05.131 - 01:42:07.214] Guest: There's something about his aura, Ranveer.
[01:42:07.715 - 01:42:09.738] Guest: It's very magnetic.
[01:42:10.759 - 01:42:14.965] Guest: And whatever he does, it's the way he sits, the way he stands, the way he speaks.
[01:42:14.985 - 01:42:15.846] Guest: He can do anything.
[01:42:16.267 - 01:42:18.610] Guest: It just feels like, for the lack of a better word, mass.
[01:42:19.672 - 01:42:21.234] Guest: You know, it just feels like that.
[01:42:21.378 - 01:42:24.503] Guest: But very intelligent person, very bold person.
[01:42:24.603 - 01:42:28.249] Guest: I think he has the courage to say things that people would not normally talk about.
[01:42:29.271 - 01:42:34.419] Guest: He's very bold, honest, open in public, which is always dangerous.
[01:42:34.599 - 01:42:36.502] Guest: But I think his fans love him for that.
[01:42:37.063 - 01:42:39.146] Guest: And he is like beyond box office.
[01:42:40.769 - 01:42:42.772] Guest: Hits or flops don't affect his career at all.
[01:42:42.812 - 01:42:43.954] Host: Yeah.
[01:42:44.162 - 01:42:47.226] Host: So it's a part of the reason I brought up his name here.
[01:42:47.286 - 01:42:49.889] Host: These are all personalities that are way beyond.
[01:42:49.949 - 01:42:51.852] Guest: They are beyond the box office collection.
[01:42:51.932 - 01:42:52.553] Guest: Like beyond.
[01:42:52.833 - 01:42:56.898] Host: It's taken time and human effort to reach that point.
[01:42:57.118 - 01:42:57.639] Guest: Absolutely.
[01:42:57.679 - 01:43:09.674] Guest: Time, human effort and also some kind of situations I think that they have very openly faced in the public eye where people saw their real character, their real personality and fell in love with that.
[01:43:10.435 - 01:43:12.498] Guest: So they have like personality fans.
[01:43:12.738 - 01:43:15.782] Host: What's the core reading of Pawan Kalyan Soh?
[01:43:16.383 - 01:43:18.305] Guest: I think he's like a courageous.
[01:43:18.565 - 01:43:19.587] Guest: He's like a lion.
[01:43:19.627 - 01:43:24.873] Guest: Like he can stand alone and he just has the guts that nobody else has.
[01:43:26.775 - 01:43:27.617] Host: I don't know why I'm saying this.
[01:43:28.798 - 01:43:33.404] Host: But I won't be surprised if he becomes the PM of our country eventually.
[01:43:33.664 - 01:43:34.886] Guest: I won't be surprised either.
[01:43:35.546 - 01:43:36.307] Guest: I really won't.
[01:43:36.367 - 01:43:38.450] Guest: Like seriously I won't because I feel
[01:43:39.490 - 01:43:42.734] Guest: He's been working in politics for many, many years.
[01:43:42.935 - 01:43:44.216] Guest: It's just that he won now.
[01:43:44.717 - 01:43:48.762] Guest: So his name has come, you know, to the upfront, but he's been working for many years.
[01:43:48.822 - 01:43:54.370] Guest: He's been building up his team, his system, his party and everything.
[01:43:54.490 - 01:43:59.436] Guest: And I feel like he's bold, courageous, always stands for the right.
[01:43:59.857 - 01:43:59.957] Host: Yeah.
[01:43:59.977 - 01:44:05.264] Host: And the one thing I know about any politician is that they enter the game to reach the top.
[01:44:06.406 - 01:44:06.706] Host: Yeah.
[01:44:06.978 - 01:44:14.849] Host: but only some people can and I feel if you've navigated the film world with so much nuance for so long and then had a successful political career.
[01:44:15.350 - 01:44:19.076] Guest: You're in prime position to... And simultaneously doing both as well.
[01:44:19.316 - 01:44:27.568] Guest: I mean to most pressurizing, not most, there's sports as well but one of the most pressurizing careers to have, right?
[01:44:27.628 - 01:44:28.669] Guest: Politics and films.
[01:44:28.770 - 01:44:30.352] Guest: Too much of pressure, mental pressure.
[01:44:31.453 - 01:44:34.578] Host: I wonder what that inner hunger,
[01:44:35.010 - 01:44:38.755] Guest: Yeah, I feel for him, it's a lot about the people.
[01:44:38.815 - 01:44:44.442] Guest: So I have, and I've seen this, like I've seen him talking to, you know, the rooted people.
[01:44:44.482 - 01:44:47.906] Guest: I've seen him talking to them and asking them their issues and working on that.
[01:44:48.367 - 01:44:49.608] Guest: Coming up with a change for that.
[01:44:49.648 - 01:44:54.294] Guest: Not just talking to them for publicity, but coming up with changes as well.
[01:44:55.475 - 01:44:57.117] Host: Can I ask you about Rajnikanth as well?
[01:44:57.157 - 01:44:58.459] Guest: Rajnikanth sir, yeah.
[01:44:58.819 - 01:45:02.404] Guest: I mean, I've not worked with him, but he is huge.
[01:45:02.524 - 01:45:04.146] Guest: I mean, even today,
[01:45:04.258 - 01:45:06.762] Guest: So, whenever you talk about me, a lot of numbers will come in.
[01:45:07.183 - 01:45:08.064] Guest: You know, more than anything.
[01:45:08.124 - 01:45:11.149] Guest: Even today, he brings in huge numbers as an opening.
[01:45:11.189 - 01:45:13.714] Guest: He has a huge business.
[01:45:14.154 - 01:45:17.700] Guest: Because people of Tamil Nadu will go for his film regardless of anything.
[01:45:17.861 - 01:45:18.942] Guest: The film doesn't even matter.
[01:45:19.623 - 01:45:21.827] Guest: It's just if it has Rajnikanth, that's all they want.
[01:45:22.068 - 01:45:23.971] Host: With him, I know for a fact.
[01:45:23.991 - 01:45:30.802] Host: Because I know certain things about him from the spiritual community and he spends a lot of time in ashrams and he goes to Teetsthans.
[01:45:31.042 - 01:45:33.925] Host: There's spiritual force inside of him.
[01:45:34.425 - 01:45:37.889] Host: That's what's driving the outward thing, which the world is seeing as material success.
[01:45:38.369 - 01:45:42.553] Guest: It has to be, you know, actually on some level to reach that position.
[01:45:42.573 - 01:45:44.615] Guest: I think somewhere it has to be.
[01:45:45.336 - 01:45:47.237] Host: Would you ever want that in any lifetime of yours?
[01:45:48.559 - 01:45:51.001] Host: That quantum of success?
[01:45:52.342 - 01:45:56.026] Guest: I mean, if any, it would have to be this lifetime.
[01:45:56.526 - 01:45:57.127] Host: This lifetime?
[01:45:57.147 - 01:45:57.447] Guest: Yeah.
[01:45:57.827 - 01:46:00.530] Guest: If it has to be any lifetime, it would have to be this.
[01:46:00.834 - 01:46:03.158] Guest: But after this, no, I would not want that.
[01:46:03.979 - 01:46:07.605] Guest: I would really just want to be happy on a farm somewhere.
[01:46:07.625 - 01:46:11.351] Guest: Not stressing, not even knowing of Twitter and Instagram and all of that.
[01:46:11.411 - 01:46:14.576] Guest: I would just want to be like in a very different zone in life.
[01:46:14.596 - 01:46:17.742] Guest: But so that's why, if it has to be any, it has to be this one.
[01:46:17.762 - 01:46:18.843] Host: On a farm somewhere.
[01:46:18.863 - 01:46:19.845] Guest: Yeah.
[01:46:19.865 - 01:46:19.965] Guest: Nice.
[01:46:19.985 - 01:46:25.394] Guest: Happy with lots of animals and lots of, you know, yeah.
[01:46:25.570 - 01:46:29.053] Host: And a nice Indian dhari.
[01:46:29.254 - 01:46:29.934] Guest: Marwadi boy.
[01:46:29.974 - 01:46:31.336] Guest: No, it doesn't have to be Marwadi.
[01:46:31.736 - 01:46:32.557] Host: Why not?
[01:46:33.798 - 01:46:35.940] Guest: I mean, it doesn't matter.
[01:46:36.461 - 01:46:38.082] Host: Have you dated any non-Marwadi boy?
[01:46:38.142 - 01:46:39.584] Guest: I've dated only non-Marwadi boys.
[01:46:39.644 - 01:46:41.566] Guest: I don't think I've ever dated a Marwadi boy.
[01:46:42.927 - 01:46:45.870] Host: So which community have you felt compatible with?
[01:46:50.074 - 01:46:50.915] Guest: Maybe South India?
[01:46:52.277 - 01:46:53.778] Guest: Maybe, because I've been...
[01:46:53.954 - 01:46:56.819] Guest: working the most in the South, but honestly I don't know.
[01:46:57.520 - 01:47:00.806] Host: Any specific South Indian... No, that I don't know.
[01:47:00.826 - 01:47:02.248] Host: ...Canada boys, Kanadega.
[01:47:02.809 - 01:47:04.312] Guest: Have I dated a Kanadega?
[01:47:05.273 - 01:47:06.034] Guest: I don't think so.
[01:47:06.375 - 01:47:06.876] Guest: I don't know.
[01:47:07.978 - 01:47:09.881] Guest: I don't know, but see that doesn't matter.
[01:47:09.901 - 01:47:10.702] Guest: Okay.
[01:47:10.722 - 01:47:14.208] Guest: So doesn't have to be a Marwari, but yeah, this has to be a good person.
[01:47:16.112 - 01:47:17.554] Host: I'll tell you from where this question's coming.
[01:47:17.858 - 01:47:21.744] Host: Like I'm Punjabi, my dad's also Punjabi, my mom's Gujarati.
[01:47:21.964 - 01:47:26.691] Host: And it's apparently a stereotype that Punjabi guys go really well with Gujarati girls.
[01:47:27.753 - 01:47:28.274] Guest: Oh!
[01:47:28.294 - 01:47:31.859] Guest: So you're gonna find yourself a nice Gujarati girl.
[01:47:31.879 - 01:47:34.283] Host: There's a reason why Dil Leggy Kudi Gujarati is a song.
[01:47:35.244 - 01:47:36.707] Host: There's actually a reason.
[01:47:36.727 - 01:47:38.730] Host: Because it's very balanced.
[01:47:39.271 - 01:47:39.972] Guest: I think so.
[01:47:40.873 - 01:47:44.178] Host: Like I'm Punjabi and I love my Punjabi bros but we're all a little crazy.
[01:47:44.322 - 01:47:45.083] Host: A little crazy.
[01:47:45.163 - 01:47:45.964] Host: You need balance.
[01:47:46.645 - 01:47:48.988] Guest: So the Gujaratiness brings in the balance.
[01:47:49.008 - 01:47:50.409] Host: And you need someone to show you your place.
[01:47:51.691 - 01:47:52.091] Guest: Always.
[01:47:52.112 - 01:47:52.913] Host: Gujarati women are strong.
[01:47:53.093 - 01:47:53.934] Host: Yeah.
[01:47:54.294 - 01:47:54.655] Guest: Always.
[01:47:55.115 - 01:47:55.376] Guest: True.
[01:47:55.396 - 01:47:56.837] Host: So therefore I throw the ball at you.
[01:47:57.678 - 01:47:59.360] Guest: For me, I don't think that matters.
[01:47:59.941 - 01:48:02.064] Guest: For me, it's just Indian is good enough.
[01:48:02.424 - 01:48:02.765] Guest: Indian.
[01:48:02.865 - 01:48:03.185] Guest: Indian.
[01:48:04.026 - 01:48:04.326] Host: That's it.
[01:48:05.888 - 01:48:06.809] Guest: Not very specific.
[01:48:06.830 - 01:48:07.250] Guest: Indian.
[01:48:07.490 - 01:48:09.533] Host: Where else have you traveled to in India?
[01:48:09.754 - 01:48:10.154] Guest: Oh my god!
[01:48:10.174 - 01:48:15.623] Guest: So I have gone all around Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for store openings and for events.
[01:48:15.723 - 01:48:19.409] Guest: Like literally the most interior places I have been to.
[01:48:20.050 - 01:48:20.611] Guest: All for work.
[01:48:20.631 - 01:48:22.454] Host: Any temple that has stayed with you?
[01:48:22.474 - 01:48:22.914] Guest: Temple?
[01:48:23.055 - 01:48:25.559] Guest: I remember going to Ujjain.
[01:48:26.280 - 01:48:27.582] Guest: I think that was lovely.
[01:48:27.602 - 01:48:29.645] Guest: There's a Kalabhairava temple also there.
[01:48:29.665 - 01:48:30.306] Guest: I went there.
[01:48:30.326 - 01:48:31.368] Guest: That was lovely.
[01:48:31.388 - 01:48:33.451] Guest: Of course Tirupati.
[01:48:35.194 - 01:48:35.314] Unknown: Hmm...
[01:48:35.842 - 01:48:36.463] Guest: so many.
[01:48:36.523 - 01:48:43.033] Guest: Kashi Tho is there and the Madurai there's a temple, Minakshi temple, so many temples.
[01:48:44.595 - 01:48:48.521] Guest: And there's actually one really small temple in Bangalore, it's called the Enoji temple.
[01:48:48.942 - 01:48:50.784] Guest: It's supposed to balance out all your chakras.
[01:48:51.485 - 01:48:52.227] Guest: Mansa light?
[01:48:53.148 - 01:48:57.234] Guest: I don't know what it's called unfortunately, I'll send you the message later so you can
[01:48:57.314 - 01:48:58.377] Guest: Put the name there.
[01:48:58.938 - 01:49:00.883] Guest: But it's supposed to balance your chakras out.
[01:49:01.083 - 01:49:02.386] Guest: So I love going there.
[01:49:02.406 - 01:49:04.913] Guest: It's very far away from my house, but I still go there.
[01:49:04.933 - 01:49:06.536] Guest: Is it kind of near the airport?
[01:49:06.557 - 01:49:07.138] Guest: Old airport.
[01:49:08.080 - 01:49:09.524] Guest: It's near the old airport, not the new one.
[01:49:09.544 - 01:49:11.288] Guest: I think we're talking about the same thing.
[01:49:11.308 - 01:49:11.549] Guest: Probably.
[01:49:11.569 - 01:49:12.391] Guest: Not many people know.
[01:49:12.411 - 01:49:13.213] Host: I'm surprised.
[01:49:13.293 - 01:49:13.814] Host: The tower.
[01:49:14.376 - 01:49:15.378] Host: Astral tower.
[01:49:15.522 - 01:49:16.303] Guest: I think yeah.
[01:49:16.323 - 01:49:17.564] Guest: How do you even know about this?
[01:49:17.604 - 01:49:19.846] Guest: Hardly anyone knows about this.
[01:49:20.347 - 01:49:25.892] Host: The thing is it's so secret and so powerful that I almost don't want to talk about it on the show.
[01:49:26.312 - 01:49:29.275] Guest: I didn't know that but that's a very powerful temple.
[01:49:29.916 - 01:49:32.338] Host: It's called Manasa Light Foundation.
[01:49:32.498 - 01:49:35.841] Host: There's a book called Doorways to Light by someone called Guruji Krishnanand.
[01:49:38.043 - 01:49:41.787] Host: All I can say is this is one of the most powerful yet unknown spots in India.
[01:49:42.227 - 01:49:45.330] Host: And I'm very hesitant about even mentioning it on the show but if it's
[01:49:45.410 - 01:49:47.332] Host: entered this conversation, I guess it wants to.
[01:49:47.352 - 01:49:49.274] Guest: Yeah, but it's a beautiful temple.
[01:49:49.955 - 01:49:51.717] Guest: Because it balances your own chakras out.
[01:49:52.578 - 01:49:55.261] Host: You know, I mean... Are you getting bored of this conversation?
[01:49:55.281 - 01:49:55.701] Guest: No.
[01:49:55.721 - 01:49:56.101] Guest: Are you?
[01:49:56.302 - 01:49:56.702] Host: No!
[01:49:57.163 - 01:49:57.903] Guest: Because I'm not.
[01:49:57.923 - 01:50:02.088] Host: This is like... Dude, I woke up with a lot of positivity today.
[01:50:02.108 - 01:50:03.149] Guest: For whatever reason.
[01:50:03.750 - 01:50:04.370] Guest: I'm glad.
[01:50:04.791 - 01:50:05.091] Host: I'm glad.
[01:50:05.111 - 01:50:09.556] Host: And my moment of waking up dictates a lot of the day for me.
[01:50:09.576 - 01:50:09.936] Guest: Same here.
[01:50:09.956 - 01:50:10.417] Guest: Same here.
[01:50:10.857 - 01:50:14.081] Guest: I mean, for me, as soon as I wake up for 20 minutes, I'm like, no one talk to me.
[01:50:14.601 - 01:50:15.282] Guest: I need...
[01:50:15.618 - 01:50:42.610] Host: that time you know because then if something happens then then my whole day is I don't think this is ego speaking because I've truly submitted even this show to the divine so I feel like anyone who's brought to this show is brought for a reason and then I'm just doing a duty I think so I think the timing is also right maybe so I think the last four months of my life have been very very weird
[01:50:43.170 - 01:50:46.196] Guest: You know, for me, lots of ups, lots of downs.
[01:50:46.436 - 01:50:49.121] Guest: It's been crazy the last four months.
[01:50:49.141 - 01:50:56.575] Guest: So it's, it's nice to have like a positive divine conversation with a spiritual being who really having a human journey.
[01:50:56.715 - 01:50:57.316] Guest: Yeah.
[01:50:57.677 - 01:51:01.825] Guest: I feel it's lovely because somewhere I feel like you understand what I'm talking about.
[01:51:02.967 - 01:51:04.690] Guest: You know,
[01:51:05.474 - 01:51:07.918] Host: You look for a spiritual tribe in the material plane.
[01:51:07.978 - 01:51:11.904] Guest: And I'm surprised and really happy to be talking to someone like that.
[01:51:11.964 - 01:51:13.947] Guest: Because half the times I feel people don't get it.
[01:51:14.708 - 01:51:17.753] Guest: They just feel like, oh, Nidhi is always in a different zone.
[01:51:17.773 - 01:51:22.099] Guest: Because once someone asked me this question, my trainer, I think, he was like, so which city would you like to live in?
[01:51:22.620 - 01:51:25.725] Guest: And I was like, let me make this a happy place to live in.
[01:51:25.745 - 01:51:28.188] Guest: And then anywhere that I live doesn't matter.
[01:51:28.789 - 01:51:33.597] Guest: You know, so you need those kind of people to interact with, right, in life.
[01:51:34.298 - 01:51:34.578] Guest: Yeah.
[01:51:34.978 - 01:51:36.900] Host: Can you talk about the last four months?
[01:51:36.920 - 01:51:38.742] Guest: Oh my God, should I?
[01:51:38.942 - 01:51:40.004] Guest: Okay, why not?
[01:51:40.224 - 01:51:41.025] Host: Whatever you're comfortable.
[01:51:41.285 - 01:51:51.696] Guest: Yeah, so the last four or five months have been like a lot of highs in terms of work, but a lot of lows in terms of my personal life.
[01:51:52.417 - 01:51:55.100] Guest: You know, so the highs have been great.
[01:51:55.120 - 01:51:58.063] Guest: The lows have also been, and it's all, it's all like happening together.
[01:51:58.103 - 01:52:00.466] Host: And navigating a successful
[01:52:00.802 - 01:52:01.963] Guest: Yeah.
[01:52:02.084 - 01:52:07.990] Guest: So it's, it's just been like confusing in a way, you know, whether what to feel.
[01:52:08.030 - 01:52:11.615] Guest: But I think everything has a divine timing, a divine reason.
[01:52:12.536 - 01:52:17.081] Guest: And once your karmic balance with someone is closed, it's, it's done.
[01:52:17.201 - 01:52:17.662] Guest: Yeah.
[01:52:17.682 - 01:52:19.484] Host: People visit your life for a limited amount of time.
[01:52:19.504 - 01:52:20.906] Host: That's pre-decided.
[01:52:20.926 - 01:52:21.506] Guest: I think so.
[01:52:21.827 - 01:52:23.849] Guest: And also teach you some great lessons.
[01:52:24.830 - 01:52:24.990] Guest: Yeah.
[01:52:25.231 - 01:52:25.972] Guest: You know.
[01:52:26.913 - 01:52:28.114] Host: Learned any nice lessons?
[01:52:29.122 - 01:52:30.964] Guest: Oh my God, so many lessons.
[01:52:31.505 - 01:52:38.934] Guest: I think the biggest, biggest lesson I've learned in the last couple of years is that the only person who's going to be there for yourself is you.
[01:52:40.376 - 01:52:50.629] Guest: You know, so you've got to make your mind, your emotional space, a good space to be in because literally the only person who's going to be there for you is you.
[01:52:51.049 - 01:52:51.610] Host: You broke up.
[01:52:52.932 - 01:52:55.615] Guest: Ranveer.
[01:52:55.635 - 01:52:57.938] Guest: Oh my God.
[01:52:58.338 - 01:52:59.700] Guest: No, it wasn't like that.
[01:52:59.720 - 01:53:02.084] Guest: I think it was much more complicated than that.
[01:53:02.184 - 01:53:06.270] Guest: It was more of a situation, not a situationship.
[01:53:06.451 - 01:53:09.696] Guest: It was more of a, I don't know what that means exactly, a situationship.
[01:53:09.736 - 01:53:14.163] Guest: I've been trying to wrap my head around it, hanging out with the Gen Z badge.
[01:53:14.663 - 01:53:16.386] Host: What is a situationship for Gen Z?
[01:53:17.528 - 01:53:18.509] Guest: I still don't get it.
[01:53:18.529 - 01:53:20.973] Guest: It seems like an open relationship to me.
[01:53:20.993 - 01:53:22.696] Unknown: It's not an open relationship.
[01:53:22.976 - 01:53:26.642] Unknown: You are in a relationship also, but you are not fully, fully committed.
[01:53:27.202 - 01:53:29.645] Guest: That is an open relationship.
[01:53:29.665 - 01:53:31.688] Unknown: But you are not looking for others also.
[01:53:31.728 - 01:53:33.210] Guest: Then why are you not committed?
[01:53:33.810 - 01:53:38.837] Host: You're not giving it a tag of like... partner.
[01:53:39.077 - 01:53:40.198] Guest: Beyond my understanding.
[01:53:41.300 - 01:53:44.383] Guest: But yeah, situations, I think.
[01:53:45.245 - 01:53:45.845] Host: Okay.
[01:53:45.865 - 01:53:47.427] Host: We weren't talking about a situation ship here.
[01:53:48.088 - 01:53:49.950] Guest: This was a relationship.
[01:53:50.251 - 01:53:51.572] Host: Mutually parted ways.
[01:53:52.754 - 01:53:56.018] Host: Because this was not the father of your children.
[01:53:56.610 - 01:53:58.172] Guest: No, this was not.
[01:53:59.834 - 01:54:02.877] Host: It's a very millennial to millennial conversation.
[01:54:03.358 - 01:54:06.862] Host: Even for guys, you're looking for a girl who could be the mother of your children.
[01:54:06.882 - 01:54:07.343] Host: And vice versa.
[01:54:07.363 - 01:54:08.344] Guest: But eventually it is that.
[01:54:08.404 - 01:54:11.007] Guest: I think it's a very primal thought, right?
[01:54:11.167 - 01:54:12.449] Host: At the stage of life we're at.
[01:54:12.589 - 01:54:14.471] Host: My career is established now.
[01:54:14.531 - 01:54:15.532] Host: Now you're looking for life.
[01:54:15.552 - 01:54:17.595] Host: There's so much more to life than building a career.
[01:54:17.695 - 01:54:18.756] Guest: 100% yes.
[01:54:18.916 - 01:54:21.680] Guest: I mean, this is... That's how I look at my work.
[01:54:22.140 - 01:54:23.762] Guest: I love my work, but it's my job.
[01:54:24.482 - 01:54:25.904] Guest: You know, my job is not my life.
[01:54:26.585 - 01:54:27.627] Guest: Life is beyond that.
[01:54:27.647 - 01:54:29.810] Guest: I need to be happy, fulfilled.
[01:54:30.551 - 01:54:32.254] Guest: I need to have a life beyond my work.
[01:54:33.015 - 01:54:35.498] Host: What are your green flags as a partner?
[01:54:35.679 - 01:54:36.620] Guest: My green flags?
[01:54:36.800 - 01:54:43.250] Guest: I think it would be understanding, loving, softness, nurturing, too nurturing.
[01:54:44.432 - 01:54:45.493] Guest: I told you know that motherly.
[01:54:46.254 - 01:54:47.897] Guest: So now I want someone who'll take care of me.
[01:54:48.277 - 01:54:49.098] Guest: That would be great.
[01:54:49.900 - 01:54:52.163] Host: I think every human wants someone to take care of them.
[01:54:52.283 - 01:54:54.226] Host: I used to think it's every man.
[01:54:54.306 - 01:54:57.710] Host: want someone, wants a girl who will take care of them, but girls want it too.
[01:54:57.931 - 01:54:58.571] Guest: Yeah.
[01:54:59.092 - 01:55:05.420] Guest: So I think all of that and at some level, I think very, like what's the right way to say this?
[01:55:05.601 - 01:55:14.592] Guest: Not helping, but very like, um, united in a way where things always become about us more than you and me.
[01:55:15.213 - 01:55:18.637] Guest: So I would do as much for the other person as I would for myself.
[01:55:18.998 - 01:55:19.999] Host: Do you want an ambitious man?
[01:55:21.621 - 01:55:22.322] Guest: Um,
[01:55:23.490 - 01:55:24.671] Guest: Not very ambitious.
[01:55:25.312 - 01:55:25.492] Guest: No.
[01:55:26.053 - 01:55:27.114] Host: Should know where to draw the line.
[01:55:27.375 - 01:55:27.855] Guest: Yeah.
[01:55:27.875 - 01:55:31.039] Guest: Should know that this is work and life is more important.
[01:55:31.940 - 01:55:33.162] Guest: Not, not very ambitious.
[01:55:33.282 - 01:55:33.903] Guest: No.
[01:55:33.923 - 01:55:40.571] Guest: Like ambitious maybe I would want a hardworking man, but not a very like only ambition.
[01:55:40.631 - 01:55:41.913] Host: No.
[01:55:41.933 - 01:55:42.614] Host: Have you dated that?
[01:55:43.354 - 01:55:43.955] Host: Only ambition?
[01:55:45.277 - 01:55:45.457] Unknown: No.
[01:55:46.759 - 01:55:47.179] Host: Okay.
[01:55:47.379 - 01:55:48.381] Host: No.
[01:55:48.401 - 01:55:48.761] Host: Yeah.
[01:55:49.262 - 01:55:52.786] Host: Because you hear a lot of women saying they're attracted to ambition.
[01:55:53.026 - 01:55:54.709] Host: But there's a flip side to ambition.
[01:55:55.730 - 01:55:56.452] Guest: I think there is.
[01:55:56.752 - 01:56:02.041] Host: Which is damage from childhood, which is like lots of time given to work, which is obsession with work.
[01:56:02.061 - 01:56:05.186] Guest: And I feel like somewhere people like that, like ambition is a great thing.
[01:56:05.206 - 01:56:09.753] Guest: So I'm a very ambitious person, but I'm a very satisfied ambitious person.
[01:56:10.595 - 01:56:12.237] Guest: It's a very contradictory thing I know.
[01:56:12.257 - 01:56:12.598] Guest: Satiated.
[01:56:12.678 - 01:56:14.541] Guest: Yeah, satiated, but ambitious.
[01:56:14.601 - 01:56:16.765] Guest: So I'm not like dying for something.
[01:56:16.825 - 01:56:20.050] Guest: It's great if it comes, I'll put in my best, but I'm not, I'm good.
[01:56:20.578 - 01:56:21.739] Guest: I know this is all temporary.
[01:56:21.819 - 01:56:22.660] Guest: One day it will be gone.
[01:56:22.700 - 01:56:23.821] Guest: They'll be like, who is Nidhi?
[01:56:23.842 - 01:56:24.422] Guest: Which is fine.
[01:56:24.482 - 01:56:25.283] Guest: Great.
[01:56:25.583 - 01:56:26.164] Host: No problem.
[01:56:26.264 - 01:56:28.967] Host: I feel like this is Nidhi ka swayamvar episode.
[01:56:28.987 - 01:56:29.207] Guest: I think so.
[01:56:29.227 - 01:56:30.349] Guest: It's becoming like that.
[01:56:30.709 - 01:56:31.410] Host: Do you mind though?
[01:56:32.871 - 01:56:34.853] Guest: Not really.
[01:56:34.873 - 01:56:35.134] Guest: It's okay.
[01:56:35.234 - 01:56:36.315] Guest: If not now, then when?
[01:56:36.395 - 01:56:36.715] Guest: Right?
[01:56:37.056 - 01:56:37.696] Guest: So why not?
[01:56:38.397 - 01:56:39.859] Guest: But what was I saying?
[01:56:39.879 - 01:56:40.079] Guest: Yeah.
[01:56:40.139 - 01:56:40.780] Guest: So united.
[01:56:42.021 - 01:56:50.290] Host: One thing I can tell you based on me getting to know you over the course of this episode is that you need someone, I think you need someone outside of media.
[01:56:50.818 - 01:56:51.639] Guest: I agree with you.
[01:56:53.222 - 01:56:54.403] Guest: I agree with you.
[01:56:54.423 - 01:57:06.201] Guest: I mean, there are some great people even, you know, in our industry, but I feel like the amount of dependability that I would require from my partner would be more.
[01:57:06.741 - 01:57:07.502] Host: Yeah.
[01:57:08.043 - 01:57:16.856] Host: There is a joy in not having any element of fame around one's life and not being into the concept of fame.
[01:57:16.876 - 01:57:18.098] Host: I've seen this in few people.
[01:57:18.402 - 01:57:19.905] Host: And they're some of the happiest people I know.
[01:57:19.925 - 01:57:20.426] Guest: Yeah.
[01:57:20.446 - 01:57:24.653] Guest: You know, I mean, I meet some people, okay, they're so excited about going out on a Friday night.
[01:57:25.094 - 01:57:28.139] Guest: They're so excited about watching like a film or traveling somewhere.
[01:57:28.159 - 01:57:29.321] Guest: And I'm like, this is nice.
[01:57:30.022 - 01:57:31.385] Guest: You know, this is nice, actually.
[01:57:31.465 - 01:57:33.568] Guest: It's a good change from even my own mind.
[01:57:34.009 - 01:57:34.270] Host: Yeah.
[01:57:34.290 - 01:57:34.851] Guest: Yeah.
[01:57:35.051 - 01:57:40.000] Host: Because I think chase for fame dictates a lot of other decisions.
[01:57:40.140 - 01:57:41.001] Host: A lot.
[01:57:41.322 - 01:57:41.703] Host: Yeah.
[01:57:41.763 - 01:57:43.526] Host: That factor is not there in the film.
[01:57:43.566 - 01:57:43.666] Unknown: Yeah.
[01:57:43.746 - 01:57:44.507] Host: True.
[01:57:44.828 - 01:57:49.575] Host: As long as one is not being obsessive about money, but just knowing how to manage it well and kind of earning it.
[01:57:49.715 - 01:57:50.156] Guest: Yeah.
[01:57:50.176 - 01:57:53.341] Host: That's the sweet spot, according to me, based on all the people I've met.
[01:57:53.361 - 01:57:54.022] Guest: Yeah.
[01:57:54.042 - 01:58:00.072] Guest: And even for me, like in terms of money, I feel like for me, money is something that I have a very healthy relationship with.
[01:58:01.153 - 01:58:03.577] Guest: Maybe because my name is Nidhi, so the name has money.
[01:58:03.597 - 01:58:04.979] Guest: My name is Nidhi Agarwal.
[01:58:04.999 - 01:58:06.722] Guest: Agarwal, so there's money and money.
[01:58:06.742 - 01:58:11.890] Guest: No, but I, I think I have a very healthy relationship with money where I,
[01:58:12.930 - 01:58:14.232] Guest: I don't know, I'm good with it.
[01:58:14.753 - 01:58:16.415] Guest: I'm not obsessive, but I love it.
[01:58:17.336 - 01:58:21.142] Guest: But at the same time, like I'm good, like I don't think too much about it.
[01:58:21.182 - 01:58:27.131] Guest: And even in terms of my future, I don't think that would be like a very big factor that I'm looking for.
[01:58:28.012 - 01:58:29.814] Guest: You know, how usually people do.
[01:58:30.455 - 01:58:31.797] Guest: For me, it's not that important.
[01:58:33.880 - 01:58:35.022] Host: Do you like expensive gifts?
[01:58:36.264 - 01:58:38.868] Guest: I like to see, I like to be, no, not really.
[01:58:38.948 - 01:58:40.530] Guest: I like to be in a place where
[01:58:40.738 - 01:58:42.801] Guest: If I like something, I should be able to buy it.
[01:58:43.582 - 01:58:45.384] Guest: I don't have to think about how much it costs.
[01:58:46.025 - 01:58:48.127] Guest: And I don't need to plan that, okay, can I buy this?
[01:58:48.287 - 01:58:50.270] Guest: I don't want to be in that space.
[01:58:50.290 - 01:58:52.052] Guest: As long as I'm not in that space, I'm good.
[01:58:52.252 - 01:58:54.195] Guest: Then it doesn't matter how much it is.
[01:58:55.396 - 01:58:56.938] Guest: And that would come from my income.
[01:58:57.419 - 01:59:01.844] Guest: So I'm not looking for someone to be dependent on that person.
[01:59:01.924 - 01:59:03.627] Guest: That's something that I'm very scared of.
[01:59:04.287 - 01:59:09.554] Guest: Which is also a part of the reason why I think I'm independent is because I don't want to depend on anyone.
[01:59:10.306 - 01:59:11.467] Guest: for anything.
[01:59:13.209 - 01:59:19.537] Host: Manifesting a nice South Indian business boy who also understands Shani.
[01:59:19.557 - 01:59:22.019] Guest: Doesn't have to be South Indian though, any whatever.
[01:59:22.039 - 01:59:28.767] Guest: I think a nice boy with a good family, good upbringing.
[01:59:30.970 - 01:59:34.674] Host: Not like a family where they step in and kind of dissect the relationship.
[01:59:35.330 - 01:59:41.679] Guest: I mean, like joint family or like a very involved family is great, but they should be good people.
[01:59:42.541 - 01:59:43.302] Guest: That's important.
[01:59:43.382 - 01:59:45.705] Host: Because one marries the family and not just the individual.
[01:59:45.725 - 01:59:46.767] Guest: Absolutely.
[01:59:46.787 - 01:59:47.147] Guest: Yeah.
[01:59:47.929 - 01:59:50.873] Host: This has been a spectacular conversation.
[01:59:50.893 - 01:59:52.255] Host: I can talk to you.
[01:59:52.275 - 01:59:55.620] Guest: I think we've spoken so much about my marriage on this episode.
[01:59:55.960 - 01:59:58.624] Guest: My mother is going to be very happy to watch this episode.
[01:59:59.085 - 02:00:00.247] Host: You're most welcome.
[02:00:00.287 - 02:00:00.788] Host: Don't worry.
[02:00:00.848 - 02:00:02.450] Host: We got this covered.
[02:00:03.842 - 02:00:06.526] Host: You also faced those shaadi kar lo beta conversations.
[02:00:06.947 - 02:00:07.888] Guest: All the time.
[02:00:08.249 - 02:00:11.093] Guest: My mom is so, so all my relatives are getting married, right?
[02:00:11.113 - 02:00:14.999] Guest: People younger than me are getting married and my mom is having like panic attacks.
[02:00:15.220 - 02:00:16.542] Host: How do you feel attending those shaadis?
[02:00:17.403 - 02:00:19.306] Guest: Honestly, I feel great.
[02:00:19.326 - 02:00:23.513] Guest: But people around me feel like, oh, she didn't get married.
[02:00:23.533 - 02:00:26.617] Guest: I'm like, I'm good, you know?
[02:00:27.058 - 02:00:32.146] Host: Do boys come up to you and pitch themselves saying, hey, Nadiya, we had this marriage.
[02:00:32.258 - 02:00:33.399] Guest: Yeah, no, no, no.
[02:00:33.419 - 02:00:34.421] Guest: Well, that hasn't happened.
[02:00:34.441 - 02:00:37.144] Guest: But, I mean, I have... That does happen.
[02:00:37.164 - 02:00:38.886] Guest: The whole marriage conversation does come up.
[02:00:39.487 - 02:00:40.208] Host: Do guys approach you?
[02:00:40.889 - 02:00:42.170] Host: And just pitch themselves for marriage?
[02:00:43.291 - 02:00:43.612] Guest: Yeah.
[02:00:43.772 - 02:00:45.875] Guest: I mean, not like come and say, hi, I want to marry you.
[02:00:45.895 - 02:00:46.435] Guest: Not like that.
[02:00:46.636 - 02:00:47.797] Host: If someone did, how would you feel?
[02:00:48.598 - 02:00:49.199] Guest: I don't know.
[02:00:49.219 - 02:00:50.260] Guest: I mean, it depends on who.
[02:00:50.560 - 02:00:50.901] Host: Energy.
[02:00:51.161 - 02:00:53.063] Guest: Energy, vibe, intention.
[02:00:54.025 - 02:00:55.006] Guest: Depends on who.
[02:00:55.026 - 02:00:59.051] Host: But there have been, like, approaches for possible marriage.
[02:00:59.071 - 02:00:59.371] Guest: Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:59.391 - 02:01:00.873] Host: Without saying it's an approach.
[02:01:00.893 - 02:01:01.714] Guest: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:02.050 - 02:01:03.732] Host: And what's your protocol?
[02:01:04.093 - 02:01:06.757] Guest: My protocol is, it depends on who the person is.
[02:01:06.777 - 02:01:07.538] Guest: So as of now, no.
[02:01:07.879 - 02:01:08.519] Guest: Okay.
[02:01:08.540 - 02:01:11.464] Host: Haven't... Can you just describe your ideal husband?
[02:01:12.045 - 02:01:12.866] Guest: Ideal husband?
[02:01:13.827 - 02:01:17.753] Guest: The most wonderful man on this planet.
[02:01:17.773 - 02:01:19.095] Guest: Yeah, that would be my ideal husband.
[02:01:19.135 - 02:01:19.536] Guest: That's it?
[02:01:19.556 - 02:01:19.956] Guest: Person.
[02:01:20.137 - 02:01:21.158] Guest: The most wonderful person.
[02:01:21.919 - 02:01:22.180] Guest: Heart.
[02:01:22.360 - 02:01:23.241] Host: Calm, collected.
[02:01:23.401 - 02:01:29.330] Guest: Calm, collected, respectful, loving, kind.
[02:01:30.050 - 02:01:31.272] Guest: Very important.
[02:01:31.473 - 02:01:32.835] Host: Unmedia-esque.
[02:01:32.855 - 02:01:33.957] Guest: Very unmedia-esque.
[02:01:34.518 - 02:01:36.362] Guest: No planning, plotting, all that.
[02:01:36.462 - 02:01:38.686] Guest: I can't, because I myself don't do that.
[02:01:39.788 - 02:01:41.070] Guest: I wish I did sometimes.
[02:01:41.812 - 02:01:44.036] Guest: Because if I did, I would be very good at it.
[02:01:44.276 - 02:01:45.178] Host: Planning and plotting.
[02:01:45.198 - 02:01:46.039] Guest: Yeah, but I don't.
[02:01:46.120 - 02:01:46.981] Guest: I don't have the energy.
[02:01:47.923 - 02:01:49.305] Host: Visualizing lots of men.
[02:01:50.748 - 02:01:51.610] Host: Yes, Nidhi Agarwal!
[02:01:52.491 - 02:01:54.034] Host: Dear one, you're right now.
[02:01:54.274 - 02:01:57.378] Guest: Oh God, my DMs are going to be now of the shaadi rishtas.
[02:01:57.518 - 02:01:58.359] Host: I'm not even kidding.
[02:01:58.399 - 02:01:59.761] Host: That's happened on this show earlier.
[02:01:59.821 - 02:02:00.441] Guest: Are you serious?
[02:02:00.461 - 02:02:02.083] Host: This is a swayamvar themed show.
[02:02:02.103 - 02:02:03.465] Guest: Oh great, so ours is a swayamvar.
[02:02:03.485 - 02:02:05.027] Guest: I never expected this Ranveer.
[02:02:05.307 - 02:02:09.072] Guest: I thought we'll be talking about like more of spirituality, but we went into shaadi.
[02:02:09.412 - 02:02:14.378] Host: Yeah, see like my main TG is women our mom's age.
[02:02:14.398 - 02:02:21.106] Host: So any actor who's on the show, who's saying they opened a marriage, I feel the parents get very happy with me.
[02:02:21.698 - 02:02:24.241] Guest: Obviously, obviously.
[02:02:24.782 - 02:02:28.606] Guest: No, but even my dad sometimes like, beta, now you should think about it.
[02:02:28.687 - 02:02:30.509] Guest: And I'm like, yeah, little more time.
[02:02:31.750 - 02:02:35.254] Host: I've noticed this in my bro's, my age, who are married.
[02:02:35.875 - 02:02:38.639] Host: It adds like some other level of stability to a guy's life.
[02:02:38.699 - 02:02:40.881] Host: And I think it adds that same kind of stability.
[02:02:40.981 - 02:02:42.003] Guest: A hundred percent.
[02:02:42.023 - 02:02:42.804] Guest: Yes, it does.
[02:02:42.944 - 02:02:45.887] Guest: Because there's no option of, okay, I don't like this.
[02:02:46.628 - 02:02:47.770] Guest: It's not that easy to leave.
[02:02:47.990 - 02:02:51.314] Guest: And somewhere I think it makes you very centered.
[02:02:51.426 - 02:02:53.950] Guest: In a way, not that you're not centered otherwise, you are.
[02:02:54.390 - 02:02:56.633] Guest: But there is a layer of comfort that comes in.
[02:02:57.114 - 02:03:00.178] Host: Yeah, it's almost like one's twenties are like the wild west.
[02:03:01.340 - 02:03:06.066] Host: You know, just go out in the world, see things, see heartbreak, failure, all that.
[02:03:06.086 - 02:03:11.053] Host: And in your thirties, you kind of want what school and college felt like again, in a different way.
[02:03:11.114 - 02:03:12.055] Guest: I think you do now.
[02:03:12.696 - 02:03:12.796] Host: Yeah.
[02:03:12.816 - 02:03:17.202] Host: Like I remember in my twenties, I used to dread having kids as a concept because I was like,
[02:03:17.474 - 02:03:21.098] Host: I won't be able to put my mind through what school and college felt like again.
[02:03:21.619 - 02:03:24.021] Host: And now, at 32, I'm hungry for it again.
[02:03:24.041 - 02:03:25.383] Guest: Oh, you want kids as well.
[02:03:25.483 - 02:03:26.904] Guest: How lovely, Ranveer.
[02:03:27.765 - 02:03:29.868] Guest: I think you'll be a great dad, by the way.
[02:03:29.888 - 02:03:31.970] Host: I'm a little scared I might be kathor as a dad.
[02:03:32.030 - 02:03:32.651] Guest: You think so?
[02:03:33.151 - 02:03:34.232] Guest: You think you'll be a bit strict?
[02:03:35.073 - 02:03:36.134] Host: I really think so.
[02:03:36.154 - 02:03:38.958] Host: I'm scared for my own kids, but I'll try balancing it out.
[02:03:39.478 - 02:03:42.962] Guest: But maybe you'll get someone who's very soft, so you'll balance it out.
[02:03:43.282 - 02:03:44.564] Guest: The both of you.
[02:03:44.904 - 02:03:46.706] Guest: That's also important in a way, though.
[02:03:46.818 - 02:03:58.649] Host: the most important thing my parents have done for me when I was amongst like I can write a book on this but the one thing that stands out more than anything is that my mom saw I was a very high energy kid and put me into martial arts.
[02:03:59.650 - 02:04:00.091] Guest: Lovely.
[02:04:00.351 - 02:04:01.091] Host: Egged it on.
[02:04:01.392 - 02:04:02.573] Host: She said keep going, keep going.
[02:04:02.593 - 02:04:05.956] Host: And I went to a very good level in martial arts and then I stopped the martial arts.
[02:04:06.116 - 02:04:11.001] Host: But what it left me with was this like really like fighter, disciplined mentality.
[02:04:11.021 - 02:04:12.402] Guest: Discipline and that.
[02:04:12.422 - 02:04:15.045] Host: Everything good came from that mentality.
[02:04:15.265 - 02:04:16.466] Host: So I'll want to put
[02:04:16.738 - 02:04:18.841] Host: Guy, girl, it doesn't matter.
[02:04:18.861 - 02:04:19.642] Host: Go into martial arts.
[02:04:19.662 - 02:04:21.284] Guest: Yeah, martial arts and dancing.
[02:04:21.804 - 02:04:27.611] Guest: So my parents put me into ballet, which is a very different, not a normal form of dance that people would put their kids in.
[02:04:28.152 - 02:04:29.534] Guest: So I've learned ballet for 8 years.
[02:04:29.594 - 02:04:32.678] Guest: And really, discipline, hard work.
[02:04:33.218 - 02:04:34.800] Guest: You know, it all comes from there.
[02:04:36.042 - 02:04:38.545] Host: We had Vidyut Jamwal on the show some time ago.
[02:04:38.565 - 02:04:40.627] Host: And I first asked him about yoga and stretching.
[02:04:40.647 - 02:04:44.652] Host: And he said that both martial arts and dance is like yoga in motion.
[02:04:44.772 - 02:04:46.034] Guest: Yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:46.242 - 02:04:46.923] Guest: Very well said.
[02:04:46.983 - 02:04:48.245] Host: Shift something inside you.
[02:04:48.265 - 02:04:48.946] Guest: Yeah, it does.
[02:04:49.667 - 02:04:49.987] Guest: It does.
[02:04:51.269 - 02:04:53.372] Host: Yeah, also the world's becoming a fitter place.
[02:04:53.392 - 02:04:56.035] Guest: Yeah, and it also brings in a lot of confidence in you, I feel.
[02:04:56.456 - 02:05:02.223] Guest: You know, when you're younger, then it's not about, oh, which car am I going in or which brand t-shirt am I wearing.
[02:05:02.263 - 02:05:03.705] Guest: It's more about what am I?
[02:05:04.346 - 02:05:05.067] Guest: I'm the brand.
[02:05:05.087 - 02:05:07.170] Guest: Yeah, I want to instill that in my kids.
[02:05:07.831 - 02:05:10.234] Guest: So no business class tickets, no nothing.
[02:05:10.374 - 02:05:16.242] Guest: It's going to be about what are you, how talented, not even how talented, you're loved unconditionally, but
[02:05:16.482 - 02:05:17.043] Guest: What are you?
[02:05:17.123 - 02:05:17.943] Guest: What are your skills?
[02:05:19.105 - 02:05:23.749] Host: The challenge is how do you give a rich baby a middle-class mindset?
[02:05:24.630 - 02:05:27.253] Host: So that it can live through and maintain its own richness.
[02:05:27.273 - 02:05:28.634] Guest: It's so important, I feel.
[02:05:29.015 - 02:05:30.116] Guest: Very, very important.
[02:05:31.577 - 02:05:32.598] Host: Fatherhood and motherhood.
[02:05:32.659 - 02:05:38.685] Guest: So we've spoken about marriage, kids, instilling the right sanskars.
[02:05:39.365 - 02:05:42.889] Host: This is the conversation I would have had with you even if I met you at a party.
[02:05:42.909 - 02:05:43.890] Guest: I think so, right?
[02:05:43.970 - 02:05:45.632] Guest: But imagine we met at a party.
[02:05:46.132 - 02:05:49.115] Guest: We would be speaking like this for like such a long time.
[02:05:49.496 - 02:05:54.280] Guest: But it's very rare that you meet people that you can really engage with and have a conversation with.
[02:05:54.300 - 02:05:55.001] Guest: Especially for me.
[02:05:55.522 - 02:05:56.222] Guest: Very difficult.
[02:05:56.342 - 02:05:57.764] Host: No, no.
[02:05:58.805 - 02:06:00.927] Host: Again, one of those episodes that I knew was gonna happen.
[02:06:01.608 - 02:06:02.909] Host: Honestly, even before you had messaged.
[02:06:03.089 - 02:06:05.912] Host: I'd seen you on a Reynolds show back in the day.
[02:06:05.932 - 02:06:06.913] Guest: Reynolds, I remember.
[02:06:07.073 - 02:06:08.194] Guest: Oh my god!
[02:06:08.274 - 02:06:09.115] Host: 2017 or 2018.
[02:06:09.355 - 02:06:12.018] Guest: Yeah, that was my initial...
[02:06:12.866 - 02:06:14.588] Guest: entry into this world.
[02:06:14.708 - 02:06:16.070] Guest: Munna Michael's time.
[02:06:16.371 - 02:06:21.538] Host: And my thought that that point was, oh need to host Nidhi on the show at some point.
[02:06:21.618 - 02:06:22.539] Guest: How sweet.
[02:06:22.559 - 02:06:24.762] Guest: So it's taken a good eight years, seven years.
[02:06:26.324 - 02:06:28.888] Guest: It took its time, but divine timing.
[02:06:31.631 - 02:06:33.033] Host: Could have spoken to you for six more hours.
[02:06:33.113 - 02:06:37.940] Guest: I think so because there's so much I feel like I still have to say, but great.
[02:06:37.960 - 02:06:38.100] Guest: Yeah.
[02:06:39.001 - 02:06:39.602] Host: You know, man,
[02:06:40.258 - 02:06:43.603] Host: At the end of this, I'd just like to say I'm looking forward to your next 2-3 years.
[02:06:43.623 - 02:06:44.985] Guest: I thought you're looking forward to my marriage.
[02:06:45.445 - 02:06:48.029] Host: I'm looking forward to attend.
[02:06:48.129 - 02:06:49.311] Unknown: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[02:06:50.733 - 02:06:54.418] Host: I think the next 2-3 years of your life are going to be very magical.
[02:06:54.538 - 02:06:59.465] Host: And I say that because I feel everyone's external world becomes their internal world.
[02:06:59.485 - 02:07:01.047] Host: And your internal world is like full of magic.
[02:07:01.327 - 02:07:02.149] Host: Thank you.
[02:07:02.709 - 02:07:03.390] Host: Thank you so much.
[02:07:03.410 - 02:07:05.734] Host: That's what I've felt, what everyone has felt.
[02:07:06.094 - 02:07:08.978] Host: Just wish you more peace.
[02:07:09.570 - 02:07:13.475] Host: and spiritual energy that you're accumulating because of whatever practices you're doing.
[02:07:13.495 - 02:07:19.562] Host: Because you're definitely doing something and it's helping every room that you enter.
[02:07:19.682 - 02:07:20.183] Host: So thank you.
[02:07:20.583 - 02:07:21.224] Host: Thank you so much.
[02:07:21.284 - 02:07:21.785] Guest: It means a lot.
[02:07:21.825 - 02:07:25.509] Guest: It was lovely and I've had the most amazing conversation with you.
[02:07:26.010 - 02:07:33.479] Guest: You're a lovely person and you have such a clean aura and such a clean heart and you work so hard.
[02:07:33.539 - 02:07:36.082] Guest: It's not easy to make it to where you've made it to.
[02:07:36.226 - 02:07:37.429] Guest: So I'm super proud of you.
[02:07:37.469 - 02:07:37.910] Host: Thank you.
[02:07:37.930 - 02:07:38.311] Host: Thank you.

[02:07:43.363 - 02:07:44.245] Host: Yes, for sure.
[02:07:44.767 - 02:07:45.428] Unknown: Thank you, Nitin.
