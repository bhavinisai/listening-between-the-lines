[00:00:00.002 - 00:00:01.144] Guest: I do want to ask you about Disney.
[00:00:01.184 - 00:00:02.386] Guest: It was a big deal.
[00:00:02.446 - 00:00:07.114] Guest: So was it difficult, hard, okay to let go because you had built something?
[00:00:08.997 - 00:00:15.549] Host: Yeah, I mean, the emotional part would be that constant sense of whatever, but not regret.
[00:00:15.649 - 00:00:17.412] Host: I don't think the word regret would come in.
[00:00:17.432 - 00:00:23.282] Host: Everything you do in the creative field gets a lot of limelight and a big thumbs up or a big thumbs down.
[00:00:23.458 - 00:00:24.560] Host: So it can be quite cathartic.
[00:00:24.940 - 00:00:30.388] Guest: Could you share what your formula is to wake up the next morning after failure and start again or keep going?
[00:00:30.768 - 00:00:33.292] Host: Formula I think for you is really self-confidence.
[00:00:34.033 - 00:00:39.902] Guest: So you do believe that we're lacking in ambition, gumption, discipline?
[00:00:39.922 - 00:00:40.042] Host: Raw.
[00:00:40.062 - 00:00:40.683] Host: Raw ambition.
[00:00:40.723 - 00:00:43.627] Host: Raw ambition is different from ambition.
[00:00:43.647 - 00:00:47.432] Host: 2% top of the pyramid that's going looking around for funding.
[00:00:47.452 - 00:00:51.378] Host: Most people are not waking up every morning and saying I'm looking around for funding.
[00:00:51.618 - 00:00:52.239] Host: Trust me.
[00:00:52.259 - 00:00:54.604] Guest: Specifically to talk about the future of India and AI.
[00:00:54.805 - 00:00:57.110] Guest: What are you looking at right now down that runway?
[00:00:57.130 - 00:00:59.836] Host: Jugaan is not a good word if you ask me.
[00:00:59.856 - 00:01:05.308] Host: It's not a great word because for most people 99% of the time it's shortcut.
[00:01:05.328 - 00:01:07.392] Guest: You said I want to outlast myself.
[00:01:07.613 - 00:01:08.274] Guest: What does that mean?
[00:01:14.338 - 00:01:16.181] Guest: Thank you so much for spending time with me today.
[00:01:16.582 - 00:01:19.507] Guest: It's a pleasure to finally be able to sit down with you.
[00:01:19.647 - 00:01:24.295] Guest: We had some trouble finding the date and the time and things like that, but I'm so glad we did this.
[00:01:25.437 - 00:01:37.138] Guest: You are currently, I think for a lot of entrepreneurs and people who want to be entrepreneurs, a voice that, you know, people trust because you've done so much and you started off
[00:01:37.602 - 00:01:42.808] Guest: with cable television and then television and movies and you've made some fantastic films.
[00:01:42.868 - 00:01:46.872] Guest: And then you were on Shark Tank, which is what people love most of all.
[00:01:47.513 - 00:01:53.940] Guest: And you've been an investor and a filmmaker, but I understand you started off making toothbrushes.
[00:01:54.761 - 00:01:55.562] Guest: Tell me that journey.
[00:01:55.602 - 00:02:03.250] Guest: How did you decide that you wanted to make toothbrushes and how did it go from making toothbrushes to making television shows?
[00:02:03.746 - 00:02:05.608] Host: Yeah, no, I guess that those are early days.
[00:02:05.648 - 00:02:11.335] Host: Firstly, I think it's very onerous when you say people want to trust your point of views, because then you need to be a little bit more thoughtful.
[00:02:11.776 - 00:02:13.518] Host: But I think I am generally thoughtful.
[00:02:13.558 - 00:02:17.843] Host: So I think hopefully during the discussion here, I'll keep that in mind.
[00:02:18.904 - 00:02:21.708] Host: No, I think at the early stages, you're extremely opportunistic.
[00:02:21.788 - 00:02:26.794] Host: And I think I didn't wake up one morning and said, I want to make two pressures.
[00:02:26.854 - 00:02:26.994] Host: Yeah.
[00:02:27.138 - 00:02:32.224] Host: What I was clear was that I wanted to start something and do something on my own.
[00:02:32.324 - 00:02:36.228] Host: What I was clear was that I'm not somebody who can implement somebody else's vision.
[00:02:36.869 - 00:02:43.717] Host: And what I was clear at that stage was that I'm extremely unclear what I want to do once I decided that I absolutely wanted to do something on my own.
[00:02:44.318 - 00:02:54.930] Host: So unlike a lot of people today that finally think they have a good idea or have this itch that they want to start something and they need to gravitate towards a good idea and their criteria is, let me first find the idea.
[00:02:55.298 - 00:03:02.565] Host: or the consumer pitch or a bad experience I've had where I think a need and necessity comes in or where the fun flow is going.
[00:03:03.466 - 00:03:06.629] Host: I think at the time which one was looking at it was much more opportunistic.
[00:03:06.869 - 00:03:17.960] Host: So I think the toothbrushes came about purely as a business opportunity where one was in any case looking at what do I want to do when I kind of want to build some businesses.
[00:03:18.521 - 00:03:24.146] Host: See, the main point is when you come with zero capital and zero sense of entitlement and zero capital,
[00:03:24.482 - 00:03:32.977] Host: And in an environment where there wasn't any capital, you have to start figuring out how you're going to actually do things without capital in every sense.
[00:03:33.538 - 00:03:37.526] Host: So a contract manufacturing, which is what we started with at that particular point in time.
[00:03:37.967 - 00:03:41.493] Host: So at that stage, there was a lot of things that were relegated to small-scale industries.
[00:03:41.653 - 00:03:46.482] Host: And toothbrushes, for example, could not be made by the majors of Colgate and many others.
[00:03:46.722 - 00:03:48.624] Host: it had to be done by a small scale industry.
[00:03:48.704 - 00:03:59.097] Host: So to me, when I read the segment of when I wanted to start, and I think, you know, the heart and the soul today of Indian entrepreneurship is not what we're talking about.
[00:03:59.117 - 00:03:59.958] Host: It's with the SMEs.
[00:04:00.159 - 00:04:01.560] Host: It's with small and the medium scale.
[00:04:02.321 - 00:04:15.057] Host: So I think that's, I feel very identifiable with that, that I still think today most people look at entrepreneurship with the economic times or the business standard headlines and who's raised funds and who's going IPO.
[00:04:15.077 - 00:04:16.018] Host: But the real,
[00:04:16.130 - 00:04:17.973] Host: Pulse is a small scale industry.
[00:04:18.453 - 00:04:19.635] Host: And I think that's where I started.
[00:04:20.496 - 00:04:31.472] Host: So having led the small scale industries at that stage manifesto that talked about which sectors were protected with the small scale industry, I said, well, I'm a small scale guy.
[00:04:31.492 - 00:04:33.135] Host: I need to start a small scale business.
[00:04:33.275 - 00:04:34.617] Host: And here's a small scale industry.
[00:04:34.677 - 00:04:36.720] Host: So I think it happened that way.
[00:04:36.900 - 00:04:43.890] Host: And then one figured out what does one need to do to set up a contract manufacturing for people who would be the output buyers for you.
[00:04:44.386 - 00:04:46.409] Host: Today, a Foxconn would do it.
[00:04:46.629 - 00:04:49.434] Host: Today, there are many others who do it, but I skate in a different manner.
[00:04:49.454 - 00:04:51.777] Host: And you set up data centers for people who are doing that.
[00:04:51.797 - 00:05:02.213] Host: So I think it's not different than what was 30 years back when I was looking at toothbrushes to what I would do today if I wanted to set up a sort of a 12 square kilometer data center.
[00:05:02.915 - 00:05:05.118] Guest: So let me roll that back a little bit.
[00:05:05.178 - 00:05:07.942] Guest: You said, Arno said there was a bug in you.
[00:05:08.503 - 00:05:10.146] Guest: I said you wanted to start something of your own.
[00:05:10.186 - 00:05:13.010] Guest: You weren't going to go and get a job.
[00:05:13.250 - 00:05:15.975] Guest: Did you come from a family of entrepreneurs and business people?
[00:05:16.335 - 00:05:17.577] Guest: So explain that back to me.
[00:05:17.597 - 00:05:20.542] Host: I had educated people versus me being under-educated.
[00:05:21.123 - 00:05:22.586] Host: My brother was a PhD.
[00:05:23.427 - 00:05:26.052] Host: And yeah, otherwise everyone's successful professionals.
[00:05:26.312 - 00:05:31.020] Host: And me at that stage was, oh damn, it looks like you can't get a job.
[00:05:31.120 - 00:05:33.484] Host: So now I think you're gonna have to start something on your own.
[00:05:33.925 - 00:05:37.010] Guest: So for people who are watching, young people watching who
[00:05:37.858 - 00:05:43.066] Guest: finishing college saying, I'd like to be an entrepreneur, but I don't know if that's for me or should I get a job?
[00:05:43.086 - 00:05:43.968] Guest: Should I not get a job?
[00:05:43.988 - 00:05:44.529] Guest: What should I do?
[00:05:45.130 - 00:05:46.191] Guest: How do you know?
[00:05:46.211 - 00:05:47.113] Host: It's a calling.
[00:05:47.153 - 00:05:48.675] Host: You have to figure that out on your own.
[00:05:48.996 - 00:05:53.603] Host: And I think, you know, this, if you're romanticized about it, watch out.
[00:05:54.284 - 00:05:58.931] Host: If you're doing it because three other people that you always have a drink with in the evening are looking at that.
[00:05:58.971 - 00:06:01.916] Host: And therefore you want don't, if he left out, watch out for that.
[00:06:03.298 - 00:06:05.682] Host: I think other than that, you have to go with your own calling.
[00:06:05.826 - 00:06:12.312] Guest: So you've done, you started off with television, then you did films, then you did very successfully Edutek.
[00:06:13.674 - 00:06:16.476] Guest: Which of these businesses brought most value to you?
[00:06:18.599 - 00:06:20.580] Guest: Monetarily and personally?
[00:06:20.601 - 00:06:27.547] Host: I think in every sense of the word, at different parts of your journey, you have to figure out what moves you and what one wants to do.
[00:06:27.988 - 00:06:34.354] Host: So again, toothbrush was opportunistic, media was serendipity.
[00:06:34.498 - 00:06:37.005] Host: I mean, I used to do front of camera hosting.
[00:06:37.146 - 00:06:38.530] Host: I used to do theater as a hobby.
[00:06:38.570 - 00:06:47.595] Host: So I think just that whole passion of me wanting to do something that was expression of creativity at the core is what guided my earlier days.
[00:06:47.856 - 00:06:48.498] Host: So I think
[00:06:48.770 - 00:06:50.573] Host: Creativity was at the core in the early days.
[00:06:50.873 - 00:06:53.137] Host: That leads to what I think I want to do for impact.
[00:06:53.157 - 00:06:55.841] Host: So a lot of people think, you know, media is frivolous, but actually it's not.
[00:06:55.921 - 00:06:57.464] Host: It's a high impact sector.
[00:06:57.864 - 00:07:07.459] Host: You're influencing people's minds, whether you're doing it from a news point of view or viewpoint point of view, but mostly from a storytelling point of view and creating characters.
[00:07:07.479 - 00:07:11.826] Host: So I think as I spent the better part of two decades creating characters or
[00:07:11.906 - 00:07:17.612] Host: and or green lighting stories, it's a very onerous task where you look at impact.
[00:07:17.632 - 00:07:25.641] Host: So I think at that stage, that created a lot of value, value systems, and I think shareholder value as we went forward.
[00:07:26.562 - 00:07:35.612] Host: Right now, for example, what one is doing overall in the space of skilling education, I think that's even more evident that it's high impact.
[00:07:36.213 - 00:07:37.394] Host: And I think, you know,
[00:07:37.826 - 00:07:48.520] Host: Sometimes you look at things from a for-profit lens, but I think I've been blessed enough from a very early stage to look at things with a little bit of not-for-profit lens also when we started our own foundation.
[00:07:49.021 - 00:07:56.871] Host: So I think that that balance has kept that really sharp balance, both for me and my wife, right through our careers as we were building the organization.
[00:07:57.492 - 00:07:59.314] Guest: When you started in television,
[00:07:59.394 - 00:08:08.265] Guest: Was there a moment, and I know you said you did it because it creatively drove you, but was there a moment there when you reach a point where you say, okay, now this actually seems like something.
[00:08:08.866 - 00:08:12.350] Guest: We have something here that is going to create legacy.
[00:08:12.410 - 00:08:14.152] Guest: We're going to build some value here.
[00:08:14.352 - 00:08:17.997] Host: I would say there were more times when I felt not so than so.
[00:08:19.018 - 00:08:20.039] Host: Let's be clear about that.
[00:08:20.079 - 00:08:29.010] Host: For everyone here building teams or building any business, most of the times you're going to feel not so than so because it's also a patience game in many parts of you.
[00:08:29.122 - 00:08:30.784] Host: media is a hit and miss game.
[00:08:31.024 - 00:08:33.186] Host: It's also a thankless job in some parts.
[00:08:33.687 - 00:08:44.218] Host: It's highly critical because when things have gone wrong, your failures are very public as compared to another idea or something else where you got funding and you shot a company.
[00:08:44.659 - 00:08:50.445] Host: Everything you do in the creative field gets a lot of limelight and a big thumbs up or a big thumbs down.
[00:08:50.745 - 00:08:51.867] Host: So it can be quite cathartic.
[00:08:52.067 - 00:08:55.090] Host: So I think for most parts, I would say,
[00:08:55.202 - 00:08:57.948] Host: It was more like, is this really what you want to do?
[00:08:57.988 - 00:09:06.585] Host: So that self-confidence and reassurance that you need to do that says this is what I want to do, especially to get up from flops, is very, very critically important.
[00:09:07.106 - 00:09:09.631] Host: So I think I would say exactly the reverse.
[00:09:09.651 - 00:09:16.786] Host: The more you actually find that element that really is this relevant for me, but at the same time, did I feel that
[00:09:16.994 - 00:09:18.637] Host: I'm onto something, yeah, I think.
[00:09:18.897 - 00:09:20.279] Host: I feel every day I'm onto something.
[00:09:20.880 - 00:09:22.162] Host: I feel every day I'm onto something.
[00:09:22.202 - 00:09:24.546] Host: So I think, yeah, you need to feel like every day.
[00:09:24.826 - 00:09:34.601] Guest: I know you've talked a lot about failure and we talk about failure on the show a lot because I personally believe we learn more from failure than we do from our successes and from other people's failures.
[00:09:34.722 - 00:09:37.526] Host: Failure is a longer period that lasts.
[00:09:37.666 - 00:09:39.629] Host: Success is, okay, now what do you do?
[00:09:39.689 - 00:09:41.672] Host: Okay, fine, you've worked out fine.
[00:09:41.732 - 00:09:42.834] Host: Now what do you do?
[00:09:42.874 - 00:09:45.298] Host: How long can you sit on success?
[00:09:45.506 - 00:09:50.032] Host: But you can sit on failure because failure makes you sit on it a little bit.
[00:09:50.793 - 00:09:56.239] Guest: Could you share what your formula is to wake up the next morning after failure and start again or keep going?
[00:09:57.040 - 00:09:59.583] Host: Formula, I think for you is really self-confidence.
[00:10:00.865 - 00:10:01.666] Host: Is really self-confidence.
[00:10:01.686 - 00:10:03.348] Guest: But that's the thing that takes a beating, right?
[00:10:03.428 - 00:10:07.994] Guest: During failure, especially in media when it's public failure, when it's a little more obvious.
[00:10:09.175 - 00:10:11.538] Host: See, you could take a beating even without getting mugged.
[00:10:11.714 - 00:10:13.977] Host: You can psychologically take a beating every single day.
[00:10:14.318 - 00:10:18.203] Host: You can beat yourself up harder and faster than most people.
[00:10:19.005 - 00:10:21.528] Host: I think the question is, what are you here?
[00:10:21.548 - 00:10:23.752] Host: I think two of my models maybe.
[00:10:23.792 - 00:10:32.805] Host: I think the self-confidence on one and I think my benchmark that I'm here to outlast myself, outlast a business, outlast an idea.
[00:10:32.865 - 00:10:39.154] Host: And I think those themes give you a very strong balance because at the core is a reservoir of self-confidence.
[00:10:39.298 - 00:10:45.885] Host: And at the output level, it is about, you know, am I gonna outlast most people?
[00:10:45.925 - 00:10:50.250] Host: And I think, and I use that as a theme because most people of us think of the here and the now.
[00:10:50.791 - 00:10:56.837] Host: As soon as you look at it with a little bit more of a longer perspective, you're gonna look at anything that's transient.
[00:10:57.058 - 00:11:02.904] Host: If you're making decisions 10, 20 a day, do you really believe all 20 decisions are gonna turn out right?
[00:11:03.384 - 00:11:04.786] Host: That'd be foolhardy.
[00:11:04.866 - 00:11:08.731] Host: So should you then start thinking out that should I do three decisions a day?
[00:11:08.751 - 00:11:10.473] Host: Because out of 20, only four are coming right.
[00:11:10.813 - 00:11:12.576] Host: But if I do three, maybe one will come right.
[00:11:12.676 - 00:11:13.837] Host: Which one is a better ratio?
[00:11:14.258 - 00:11:17.622] Host: I think the 20 with the three versus the three versus the one.
[00:11:17.782 - 00:11:21.186] Host: But most people would say, Mathematica, how does that make sense?
[00:11:21.527 - 00:11:26.133] Host: No, I'd rather take three decisions and get one right than take 20 decisions and only get three right.
[00:11:26.853 - 00:11:29.056] Host: But that is the differentiator.
[00:11:29.096 - 00:11:29.877] Host: That is the pulse.
[00:11:29.937 - 00:11:33.682] Host: That's why you get up and start thinking every single day, am I onto something?
[00:11:34.754 - 00:11:37.357] Guest: You said, I want to outlast myself.
[00:11:37.378 - 00:11:37.958] Guest: What does that mean?
[00:11:38.739 - 00:11:43.325] Host: Well, in the sense, when you have your sense of real success, everyone starts measuring.
[00:11:43.366 - 00:11:51.516] Host: So if you don't have a huge parameter for that success, and you're looking always five steps ahead in terms of, I'm going to be around longer than most people.
[00:11:51.657 - 00:11:57.885] Host: So when I, for example, when we exited the media business, most people thought, oh, we were abandoning that.
[00:11:57.965 - 00:12:01.650] Host: And now I'm a serial entrepreneur, whatever that means.
[00:12:01.730 - 00:12:04.633] Host: and I'm here, I've built something and I'm selling it.
[00:12:04.673 - 00:12:05.313] Host: Absolutely not.
[00:12:06.034 - 00:12:13.961] Host: In that process, the only reason we could unlock that value is because we outlasted 1,500 other people who were in media.
[00:12:14.562 - 00:12:16.964] Host: And maybe there were about 20, 30 that were there at the end.
[00:12:17.525 - 00:12:24.311] Host: In that 15-year journey, almost 1,470 would have in some way packed up, consolidated, gone under.
[00:12:24.892 - 00:12:30.437] Host: So to me, the formula of real value creation was one outlasted, not the exit event.
[00:12:30.457 - 00:12:31.698] Guest: To survive, basically.
[00:12:31.938 - 00:12:34.123] Host: Survival just sounds like a bit of instinct.
[00:12:34.244 - 00:12:38.715] Host: I think, you know, it's like your daily food Outlast is a visionary thing.
[00:12:38.735 - 00:12:39.637] Host: It's a missionary thing.
[00:12:39.698 - 00:12:44.690] Host: It's something that I think you need to put there that When you measure yourself that says, okay
[00:12:45.186 - 00:12:51.877] Host: There've been many competitive elements where we got in and, you know, where people would say, oh, but look what this one's doing, look what that one's doing.
[00:12:52.077 - 00:12:54.662] Host: You know, where are you on this one, but look at where this one's going.
[00:12:55.122 - 00:12:57.847] Host: And I think if you look at, look, I'm going to be around for the next 20 years.
[00:12:57.907 - 00:12:59.750] Host: So why am I getting into a conversation here?
[00:12:59.890 - 00:13:01.152] Host: I know exactly what I want to do.
[00:13:01.252 - 00:13:06.381] Host: It gives you a little bit more of a singular focus in what you want to do, because otherwise you can be really pulled.
[00:13:06.822 - 00:13:11.890] Host: If you're there to outlast your short-term views, the views of what people else think,
[00:13:12.002 - 00:13:17.928] Host: the pressures that you feel on a daily basis because somebody did something right and said, shit, why wasn't I doing that?
[00:13:18.489 - 00:13:19.290] Host: Will be incredible.
[00:13:19.811 - 00:13:27.038] Host: And actually that'll weigh on your mind as a failure and a pull down because failure is not about something went wrong and somebody gave you a flop, right?
[00:13:27.058 - 00:13:29.121] Host: The failure is also about missed opportunities.
[00:13:29.141 - 00:13:33.405] Host: So a lot of us can pull down because why didn't I think of that as a failure?
[00:13:33.466 - 00:13:41.234] Host: Now that can either eat you up or you can be even more restless with yourself to see how am I not gonna allow this
[00:13:41.538 - 00:13:41.999] Host: to happen.
[00:13:44.162 - 00:13:46.026] Host: Is that too evolved?
[00:13:46.086 - 00:13:46.847] Guest: No, no, no.
[00:13:46.947 - 00:13:47.608] Guest: That's perfect.
[00:13:47.628 - 00:13:55.041] Guest: I was thinking for a lot of times for entrepreneurs, when either they're doing their round of fundraise or they're looking for those initial angels.
[00:13:55.081 - 00:14:00.370] Host: Not the small scale guys, not the medium scale guys, not 95% of the people who are living in that
[00:14:00.450 - 00:14:04.820] Host: You know, 2% top of the pyramid that's going looking around for funding.
[00:14:04.840 - 00:14:09.110] Host: Most people are not waking up every morning and saying, I'm looking around for funding.
[00:14:09.130 - 00:14:09.731] Host: Trust me.
[00:14:09.751 - 00:14:17.970] Guest: The people who are looking for funding, you'll meet a lot of people saying, no, no, no, but you know, if you did your business this way, or if you changed what you're doing, or if you...
[00:14:18.178 - 00:14:20.821] Guest: You don't want the funder giving them that advice?
[00:14:20.981 - 00:14:21.201] Host: Yeah.
[00:14:21.742 - 00:14:25.086] Guest: So there's a lot of that insecurity that builds in, okay, am I doing it wrong?
[00:14:25.146 - 00:14:26.427] Guest: Should I change what I'm doing?
[00:14:26.467 - 00:14:30.352] Guest: Should I change what I'm doing in order to suit the people who have the funds?
[00:14:30.612 - 00:14:32.094] Guest: What's your response to all of that?
[00:14:33.555 - 00:14:38.040] Host: My response is very stark and very clear because I think this is the real quagmire.
[00:14:39.262 - 00:14:42.565] Host: When somebody is investing in you, they're investing in your vision.
[00:14:43.166 - 00:14:46.610] Host: They may have a point of view, but at the end of the day, they're investing in your vision.
[00:14:46.946 - 00:14:52.092] Host: They're going to spend that three hours with you a month or two hours with you a month, but most of the other time, they're going to leave it to you.
[00:14:52.152 - 00:14:53.514] Host: That's what they've put in money for.
[00:14:54.115 - 00:14:56.337] Host: So I think it's the job of an investor to question.
[00:14:57.639 - 00:15:09.113] Host: The challenge with a lot of those entrepreneurs who go out and are constantly raising funding is that you don't understand the diversity of the investors that you bring into your company.
[00:15:09.633 - 00:15:13.618] Host: And each of them have a very different point of view, different life cycle, different anything.
[00:15:14.178 - 00:15:16.802] Host: and each of them will have their past experiences.
[00:15:16.862 - 00:15:19.886] Host: So each of them will say, no, but when I did this investment, this didn't go wrong.
[00:15:20.266 - 00:15:25.514] Host: Now you've got this reservoir, but there's some crocodiles in that reservoir also in that context.
[00:15:25.534 - 00:15:27.477] Host: And I don't mean sharks, I mean crocodiles.
[00:15:27.497 - 00:15:35.748] Host: In the sense is, now suddenly you have to be a very mature entrepreneur to be able to handle, in my opinion, more than one or two investors.
[00:15:36.409 - 00:15:42.898] Host: The minute you move past one or two investors, I would say your maturity level is to go up because yes, you're gonna get feedback,
[00:15:43.490 - 00:15:48.396] Host: Yes, it'll be varied feedback with each of them saying, no, no, but this didn't work for me, this didn't work for them, but they've always looked.
[00:15:48.976 - 00:16:04.614] Host: So I think you have to first seek solace and look at inputs with people who have actually built companies, because advice is, and I don't mean that in a flippant way at all, because on the flip side, the investors have seen enough failures themselves more than even an entrepreneur has.
[00:16:05.035 - 00:16:11.602] Host: So their insights are very strong, but you've got to be able to figure out that if two people say this is not gonna work, two people, how are you gonna handle that?
[00:16:11.810 - 00:16:23.186] Guest: As an investor yourself at this point, do you believe in the bootstrapping method more or the raise the funds go after the market?
[00:16:23.330 - 00:16:24.431] Guest: build that valuation.
[00:16:24.451 - 00:16:25.713] Host: Everything has got its own merits.
[00:16:25.813 - 00:16:26.774] Host: There are no formulas.
[00:16:26.854 - 00:16:30.078] Host: I think this word playbook is an archaic word.
[00:16:30.138 - 00:16:31.140] Host: It should never be used.
[00:16:31.200 - 00:16:31.981] Host: I don't know what that means.
[00:16:32.341 - 00:16:35.906] Host: It's like one man's meat and another man's poison was an old phrase, right?
[00:16:35.986 - 00:16:37.067] Host: What is a playbook?
[00:16:37.087 - 00:16:39.210] Host: How can my playbook be the same as your playbook?
[00:16:39.250 - 00:16:39.790] Host: It's absurd.
[00:16:39.911 - 00:16:42.954] Host: Anyone in any sector says, I've seen this playbook before.
[00:16:42.974 - 00:16:44.596] Host: I think it's a fallacy.
[00:16:45.157 - 00:16:49.202] Host: If you are going to rewrite this, you can take a few clippings from somewhere.
[00:16:49.570 - 00:16:51.993] Host: So, you know, should one go bootstrapping?
[00:16:52.373 - 00:16:56.037] Host: It just depends on how and what you want, how you want to run the business.
[00:16:56.397 - 00:16:59.921] Host: See, bootstrapping does not mean cutting corners, right?
[00:17:00.021 - 00:17:08.771] Host: Bootstrapping actually means you are learning the one of the best things in life, which is A, discipline and frugality.
[00:17:09.512 - 00:17:15.378] Host: If you can build your business with an incredible sense of discipline and frugality, you're done.
[00:17:15.906 - 00:17:25.942] Guest: As an investor, when you hear ideas and when you meet founders, what strikes you right now about a good, solid business?
[00:17:27.725 - 00:17:30.750] Host: I think it would be exactly how the person's been able to explain that.
[00:17:31.632 - 00:17:38.303] Host: Sectors are interesting and I do believe at different stages there are different life cycles and sectors for an important part.
[00:17:38.843 - 00:17:40.466] Host: But at the end of the day,
[00:17:41.250 - 00:17:46.277] Host: there'd be 40 players in a segment and the herd mentality in India or any most other places is very high.
[00:17:47.098 - 00:18:03.420] Host: So even if there was a sector, the biggest drawback of a good sector or a sunshine sector or an interesting sector is you know that you have to factor herd mentality and you have to make a lot of divisions and multiplications to figure out how is this person gonna be able to do that.
[00:18:03.941 - 00:18:10.450] Host: So actually you have to be a lot more astute with founders in segments that are really looking like the next big thing.
[00:18:10.594 - 00:18:13.618] Host: because the herd mentality, if you can't handle, you'll be nobody.
[00:18:13.678 - 00:18:17.062] Host: You may have a great idea, you will be in the right sector, but I'm not here to back a sector.
[00:18:17.102 - 00:18:21.227] Host: Finally, at the end of the day, it's about the two or three people that are gonna stand out in that sector.
[00:18:21.247 - 00:18:28.496] Host: So I think it's about that as much as it is about somebody comes back and gives me an idea on agriculture, for example.
[00:18:28.516 - 00:18:31.680] Host: Now, one may say, now, what can you do so innovative in agriculture?
[00:18:32.060 - 00:18:34.884] Host: But it is still 55%, 55% of our GDP.
[00:18:35.505 - 00:18:36.626] Host: So if somebody can come up
[00:18:36.770 - 00:18:55.653] Host: with elements in agriculture, even though the next big thing is this deep tech and AI and solar and XYZ, I would look at it because I would look at exactly what this person wants to build over a period of the next four to five years, why that would be disruptive, at scale how would this get monetized, and how impactful it would also be.
[00:18:56.234 - 00:19:06.066] Guest: There was a debate raised by one of our ministers that Indian entrepreneurs are not doing enough innovation and they're not creating
[00:19:06.146 - 00:19:12.073] Guest: real value in deep tech and in AI and other countries are getting ahead of us.
[00:19:13.814 - 00:19:20.942] Guest: The response to that largely on a LinkedIn type of space was, you've not created the environment for us to actually innovate.
[00:19:21.283 - 00:19:26.028] Guest: I want to understand where you stand because I know that you're doing a lot of work in that space right now.
[00:19:26.048 - 00:19:35.218] Guest: Do we have an environment to actually create our AI capacities, our applications, our data centers,
[00:19:36.866 - 00:19:45.334] Host: Israel's been at war for almost 100 years, but they've created the best entrepreneurs in many ways, if you ask me.
[00:19:45.354 - 00:19:52.361] Host: And I'm not a fan both ways, and I'm not here to talk about, I'm not a pro or a con as far as what goes on in the Middle East right now.
[00:19:52.461 - 00:19:56.485] Host: But all I would just say to you is, you create your own environment.
[00:19:56.505 - 00:20:01.210] Host: Can you imagine somewhere where for two years you have to enlist in the army, when you never know when you're going to be called?
[00:20:01.650 - 00:20:05.234] Host: Imagine having an entrepreneurial ecosystem that is thinking of innovation.
[00:20:05.794 - 00:20:10.483] Host: So I think it's a cop-out if we think that any government is to create an environment of that.
[00:20:11.325 - 00:20:13.369] Host: We don't need to create an environment for innovation.
[00:20:13.389 - 00:20:15.313] Host: There's no license you need for innovation.
[00:20:15.694 - 00:20:17.136] Host: You can go out and do it what you want to do.
[00:20:17.177 - 00:20:24.471] Host: This is such a media diverse market here, where if you really punch hard on something, you'll get somewhere.
[00:20:24.992 - 00:20:28.018] Host: You know, 20, 30 years back somebody decided to make a
[00:20:28.194 - 00:20:36.807] Host: fire extinguisher, and the campaign caught on, and suddenly everyone suddenly, so I think today for innovation, you don't need an environment.
[00:20:36.867 - 00:20:37.968] Host: I think it's a complete cop-out.
[00:20:38.129 - 00:20:39.290] Host: That's why I gave you that example.
[00:20:39.771 - 00:20:51.408] Host: Take a small country where actually that's constantly at some stage of conflict, where you feel political uncertainties at the helm, I'll never know whatever else, two years I have to get to the army, where am I gonna start becoming an entrepreneur?
[00:20:51.428 - 00:20:53.371] Host: But actually, you look at that community, you look at that.
[00:20:53.491 - 00:20:58.098] Host: Even here today, if you look at some of the business communities in India,
[00:20:58.434 - 00:21:00.417] Host: They're sharp, they're going about their own looking.
[00:21:00.457 - 00:21:01.579] Host: What is the ecosystem?
[00:21:01.699 - 00:21:02.800] Host: Why have you not created this?
[00:21:02.881 - 00:21:04.583] Host: Why is there a context?
[00:21:04.603 - 00:21:08.068] Host: So I think for innovation, you don't need permission ever.
[00:21:08.589 - 00:21:16.000] Guest: And specifically to talk about the future of India and AI, what are you looking at right now down that runway?
[00:21:17.262 - 00:21:20.466] Host: So, I mean, I think we're still at product development stage.
[00:21:20.627 - 00:21:28.338] Host: And I think I only just wonder that the more hype we create on this, the more expectancy comes in, then everyone wants to do everything in the arena.
[00:21:28.706 - 00:21:32.411] Host: But just to go back to this whole context of AI and innovation that we were talking about.
[00:21:32.812 - 00:21:34.934] Host: But, you know, there's enough happening in space.
[00:21:35.095 - 00:21:36.877] Host: There's enough happening in deep tech here.
[00:21:37.198 - 00:21:40.442] Host: Now, we don't necessarily talk about that because not much capital is going there.
[00:21:40.963 - 00:21:48.373] Host: It's so much more fun to talk about quick commerce or 10-minute delivery or the way you can hail a cab or e-commerce.
[00:21:48.393 - 00:21:53.339] Host: Now, just those are some of the ones that have just come about and become a certain sense of buzzword.
[00:21:53.359 - 00:21:58.226] Host: So sometimes the media leads those stories and takes it in a particular manner.
[00:21:58.402 - 00:21:59.743] Host: a lot of innovation happening.
[00:22:00.464 - 00:22:03.847] Host: I think there's a lot of innovation happening even with the small and medium scale business.
[00:22:03.907 - 00:22:06.189] Host: There's a lot of innovation happening in the pharma sector.
[00:22:06.750 - 00:22:11.374] Host: But today, when you talk about space, India will come in the top five countries where anyone talks about it.
[00:22:11.835 - 00:22:12.015] Host: Why?
[00:22:12.295 - 00:22:13.096] Host: Not by accident.
[00:22:13.917 - 00:22:16.259] Host: It's not just ISRO, but it's everything else also.
[00:22:16.279 - 00:22:18.961] Host: It's what the private sector may also be doing as we go forward.
[00:22:19.682 - 00:22:23.465] Host: Similarly, if you look at pharma, yeah, we're out there in some form or the other.
[00:22:23.505 - 00:22:28.370] Host: There is a little bit of a tainted impression, but mostly between R&D,
[00:22:28.514 - 00:22:46.420] Host: and our ability to be able to create drugs at a competitive price for the rest of the world, if it wasn't for the Western world actually holding onto prices and a few more, few very large pharma companies today that actually block out just on pricing, you know, and that pharma mafia has a very different context.
[00:22:46.960 - 00:22:53.810] Host: You may say that environment is actually choking more because it's not in their interest to find a cure for cancer or for Alzheimer.
[00:22:54.178 - 00:22:57.263] Host: But that doesn't mean people are not finding a cure for Alzheimer's cancer today.
[00:22:57.624 - 00:23:03.294] Host: So I think innovation is you never ever need permission or a license.
[00:23:03.895 - 00:23:06.680] Host: And you definitely don't want to wait for the government to create an environment to do that.
[00:23:07.261 - 00:23:08.683] Guest: What environment?
[00:23:08.703 - 00:23:10.747] Guest: You spoke about SME and MSME.
[00:23:11.067 - 00:23:14.994] Guest: Should there be, and we've had so much talk about it, creating
[00:23:15.394 - 00:23:23.644] Guest: spaces and environments for the MSMEs by health sector where they're able to raise debt easily, where they're able to sort of get...
[00:23:23.664 - 00:23:24.886] Host: I think they do have a debt.
[00:23:25.146 - 00:23:34.799] Host: I do want to tell you when I started with toothbrushes many years ago, while it was relegated to the small scale industry and then it went out from there, I don't think you need protectionism today.
[00:23:35.199 - 00:23:37.522] Host: But at that stage, no, there was no way I could get a loan.
[00:23:37.666 - 00:23:48.979] Host: There was no way absolutely I could get a loan even though it was mortgaged on plant and machinery because at the end of the day, a personal guarantee of nothing because I had nothing in my pocket or no wealth creation of it or any value whatsoever.
[00:23:49.119 - 00:23:52.784] Host: So personal guarantee of a zero value is no personal guarantee.
[00:23:53.685 - 00:23:55.747] Host: So I think this is not about protectionism.
[00:23:55.767 - 00:23:56.788] Host: It's not about regulation.
[00:23:57.569 - 00:24:05.298] Host: But yes, I think the ability for an ecosystem to be able to make it much more competitive, that's very, very doable.
[00:24:05.442 - 00:24:08.565] Host: And I think we have our interest rates where we have them.
[00:24:08.926 - 00:24:23.202] Host: But yes, if we had the innovation that we want to get, and if we propelled that with very low interest rates, the discipline on governance would need to be incredible, because I do believe we'll go first the bad way and then the good way.
[00:24:23.682 - 00:24:28.387] Host: And that's dangerous, because that bad way means suddenly then you reverse everything and say, see, we always knew it.
[00:24:28.407 - 00:24:29.388] Host: We were never ready for this.
[00:24:30.049 - 00:24:33.092] Host: But if you could, for the right sectors, you should.
[00:24:33.693 - 00:24:34.514] Host: And there was.
[00:24:34.658 - 00:24:42.350] Host: I mean, there are export commotion councils where you get rebates, you get subsidies, you get your 10% back, which is equal to getting interest-free.
[00:24:42.931 - 00:24:44.213] Host: So there is a fair bit of that.
[00:24:44.934 - 00:24:49.741] Host: Has that created a very competitive environment?
[00:24:49.761 - 00:24:50.101] Host: No.
[00:24:50.562 - 00:24:52.906] Host: It's become a little bit more of a taken for granted.
[00:24:53.427 - 00:24:58.214] Host: So normally I'm saying subsidies means you need to go for it.
[00:24:58.494 - 00:25:01.479] Host: If I had this, my God, I should be able to triple my thing.
[00:25:01.499 - 00:25:03.602] Host: It's about now I've got this, I've got my comfort level.
[00:25:04.162 - 00:25:14.839] Host: So there, I think that raw ambition, India, we're still some way away because I think our work ethics, our discipline and our raw ambition can be really raw.
[00:25:15.640 - 00:25:16.622] Host: Has to be really raw.
[00:25:16.762 - 00:25:17.503] Host: It's not that raw.
[00:25:18.966 - 00:25:21.690] Host: It's got a lot of entitlement built into that.
[00:25:22.792 - 00:25:28.702] Host: As anyone says, you want innovation, but where's the, fine.
[00:25:28.782 - 00:25:29.142] Host: Okay.
[00:25:29.222 - 00:25:31.506] Host: So Piyush Goyal said, you know,
[00:25:31.778 - 00:25:34.661] Host: I can't do FTAs all the way around, it's protectionism.
[00:25:34.781 - 00:25:35.042] Unknown: Fair.
[00:25:37.224 - 00:25:40.528] Host: Most of you are copying, why don't we get out there and innovate because otherwise what's the point?
[00:25:41.009 - 00:25:46.395] Host: It's a fair context to make and it doesn't mean because it came from the government or came from a commerce minister.
[00:25:46.415 - 00:25:54.864] Host: I think it's a conversation that would have between five people there again saying, what is the environment you would need that is not being compelled for you to do that?
[00:25:56.046 - 00:25:56.786] Host: Nothing's stopping me.
[00:25:57.627 - 00:25:59.890] Guest: So you do believe that we're lacking in
[00:26:00.706 - 00:26:04.231] Host: Ambition, gumption, discipline, raw ambition.
[00:26:04.271 - 00:26:06.174] Host: Raw ambition is different from ambition.
[00:26:06.875 - 00:26:07.275] Host: How is it different?
[00:26:07.295 - 00:26:08.437] Host: The state is different from raw.
[00:26:08.897 - 00:26:09.498] Host: How do you like it?
[00:26:09.598 - 00:26:10.920] Host: Medium, raw, or whatever else.
[00:26:10.940 - 00:26:16.007] Host: And I don't want to say it because half our country is vegetarian, so you may not get the analogy, so I can hold back from that.
[00:26:16.468 - 00:26:18.651] Host: But I think, you know, yeah.
[00:26:18.831 - 00:26:22.977] Host: See, that raw ambition is not craziness, it's not jugal.
[00:26:23.317 - 00:26:26.642] Host: Because jugal is not a good word, if you ask me.
[00:26:26.786 - 00:26:31.832] Host: It's not a great word because for most people 99% of the time it's shortcut.
[00:26:32.834 - 00:26:36.078] Host: For 1% of the people it's I'm in solution mode.
[00:26:36.578 - 00:26:39.302] Host: But for 99% I'm in a shortcut.
[00:26:39.322 - 00:26:43.207] Host: Yeah, if I can do anything under the sun to get where I want to get, yeah.
[00:26:43.227 - 00:26:46.751] Host: But no, I don't think you can do anything under the sun to get to where you want to get.
[00:26:46.831 - 00:26:49.234] Guest: Give me an example of raw ambition in your opinion.
[00:26:50.498 - 00:26:51.079] Host: An example?
[00:26:51.419 - 00:26:51.519] Unknown: Yeah.
[00:26:51.539 - 00:26:52.921] Guest: I mean, what do you mean by raw ambition?
[00:26:52.941 - 00:26:53.281] Guest: How is that?
[00:26:53.361 - 00:26:55.503] Host: The people are building incredible companies.
[00:26:55.543 - 00:27:01.270] Host: There are people who are actually getting out there that, you know, it's like, why are you at it on a daily basis?
[00:27:01.290 - 00:27:01.870] Host: You need that.
[00:27:02.010 - 00:27:04.273] Host: But you also need the work discipline that goes with it.
[00:27:04.573 - 00:27:06.075] Host: And I'm not talking about the 17 hour day.
[00:27:06.095 - 00:27:06.755] Host: Don't get me wrong.
[00:27:07.176 - 00:27:16.626] Host: Just that element of work discipline and ethics and a lower sense of entitlement that I think will make you just say every day is day one.
[00:27:17.762 - 00:27:23.490] Guest: It's fascinating because now we're also talking about AI replacing humans.
[00:27:24.771 - 00:27:26.794] Guest: And there are job cuts happening across the board.
[00:27:26.934 - 00:27:28.636] Host: Are we calling ourselves humans?
[00:27:28.696 - 00:27:31.200] Host: Are we starting to brand ourselves?
[00:27:31.320 - 00:27:32.622] Host: I think it's quite rude.
[00:27:32.742 - 00:27:35.445] Host: I don't want to be called a human.
[00:27:37.107 - 00:27:39.090] Guest: We're talking a lot about AI.
[00:27:39.170 - 00:27:40.473] Guest: resulting in job cuts.
[00:27:40.493 - 00:27:41.235] Unknown: Replacing one of us.
[00:27:41.436 - 00:27:46.989] Unknown: I don't mind you talking to the first person, I don't want to talk to the third person.
[00:27:47.210 - 00:27:55.250] Guest: And the possibility in the future of robotics on factory floors also replacing workers.
[00:27:55.522 - 00:27:59.147] Host: But that's been happening for the last 20, 30 years on factory floors.
[00:27:59.167 - 00:28:01.851] Guest: So in a country like India, then where does this...
[00:28:01.871 - 00:28:10.964] Host: Automation did, a conveyor belt did that some days back versus, you know, then a conveyor belt did that, robotics would do that, you know, anything and everything.
[00:28:11.225 - 00:28:12.306] Host: That's an ongoing process.
[00:28:12.366 - 00:28:14.049] Host: It's not a today, here and now.
[00:28:14.510 - 00:28:17.554] Host: It's been happening for a fair bit of time.
[00:28:18.690 - 00:28:47.442] Host: you go to a company in Norway or Sweden and you know doing something that we are doing here and you know I went there and we were having a conversation they're doing a hundred million dollar business in this in the sector and there were 15 people in a really nice lovely cozy high seating office and I said ah it's a day off you're working digitally he says no I said holiday no I said well where's the people he says that's it we're 15 of us running this hundred million dollar revenue company you know so
[00:28:47.522 - 00:28:49.905] Host: this displacement context comes from where?
[00:28:49.965 - 00:28:54.752] Host: Because if you haven't thought about it that way, nobody's going to replace, displace those 15 people.
[00:28:55.093 - 00:28:56.835] Host: Now that doesn't mean everyone needs to be at that size.
[00:28:56.875 - 00:28:57.576] Host: Don't get me wrong.
[00:28:58.117 - 00:29:03.365] Host: And, but I'm just saying that's going to be a context that is there to stay.
[00:29:03.525 - 00:29:06.990] Host: It's like again, the entitlement that I need my job and I'm going to get displaced.
[00:29:07.010 - 00:29:07.931] Host: Why would you get displaced?
[00:29:07.971 - 00:29:12.818] Guest: But for a country like India, which has the kind of, you know, the kind of
[00:29:12.962 - 00:29:14.965] Host: Yes, we're blessed with 1.4 billion.
[00:29:15.145 - 00:29:16.587] Host: And a little bit, it's also our curse.
[00:29:16.787 - 00:29:17.288] Guest: Yes.
[00:29:17.529 - 00:29:23.477] Guest: And when we're talking about skilling right now, if the environment is changing so quickly, where does the skilling go then?
[00:29:23.497 - 00:29:24.479] Guest: Where do we take these people?
[00:29:25.039 - 00:29:25.961] Guest: How do you employ them?
[00:29:26.361 - 00:29:28.404] Guest: And where do they go?
[00:29:28.705 - 00:29:30.067] Host: But I think the opportunity is here.
[00:29:30.227 - 00:29:33.872] Host: And without self-employment, opportunities that are to be created.
[00:29:33.952 - 00:29:36.616] Host: Like where we're working with our Swades Foundation for profit.
[00:29:37.137 - 00:29:40.882] Host: Again, five years back when we were training masons and carpentry,
[00:29:40.962 - 00:29:45.366] Host: and everyone said, I'll do the skilling and I need to get a job.
[00:29:45.767 - 00:29:47.228] Host: Then they would come back with a precondition.
[00:29:47.328 - 00:29:51.512] Host: But sir, we won't go 20 km away from here.
[00:29:51.733 - 00:29:55.136] Host: So then he's making a precondition to me that no, but I'm not familiar.
[00:29:55.176 - 00:29:57.799] Host: You got a job in Delhi.
[00:29:58.900 - 00:29:59.660] Host: That's not okay with me.
[00:30:00.301 - 00:30:03.905] Host: So I think we need to understand that that entitlement has gone away.
[00:30:03.985 - 00:30:09.330] Host: Today, when we're skilling people, 50% of the youth have come back and said, don't worry.
[00:30:09.474 - 00:30:11.537] Host: I'll figure my own job out.
[00:30:12.318 - 00:30:19.869] Host: I'll do less work but I'll work for 180 days instead of 365 days and I'll earn the same amount but I'll be a freelancer.
[00:30:19.889 - 00:30:28.662] Host: So there is a lot happening in the world and there's a lot happening in opportunities where you can look at how you want to manage your career because nobody else is going to manage for you.
[00:30:29.063 - 00:30:34.130] Host: We can sit here on these round tables for the next 20 years and debate how are we going to get jobs for people.
[00:30:34.370 - 00:30:36.012] Host: There's a limit to what the government can do.
[00:30:36.072 - 00:30:37.694] Host: There's a limit to what the private sector can do.
[00:30:37.734 - 00:30:39.395] Host: There's a limit to what any one company can do.
[00:30:40.316 - 00:30:44.000] Host: Each sector is actually hiring less today.
[00:30:44.160 - 00:30:45.582] Host: That's a fact of life.
[00:30:46.022 - 00:30:47.424] Host: But more sectors are opening up.
[00:30:48.165 - 00:30:50.067] Host: That's one part.
[00:30:50.087 - 00:30:57.655] Host: We've never been a manufacturing base, and I think the fact that we are now becoming a slightly bigger and stronger manufacturing base is allowing that.
[00:30:57.675 - 00:31:00.498] Host: But the level of training that's going to those people,
[00:31:00.962 - 00:31:21.355] Host: Five years from now, if that had to go and those people go out, if they have 20% attrition every year, that people, when they're looking at global standard manufacturing, either in automobile or in an iPhone or in electronics or later on data centers, in five years, those people, they'll have a much better base camp for what they want to do.
[00:31:21.835 - 00:31:24.800] Host: As compared to today, there's a delivery person.
[00:31:24.860 - 00:31:25.381] Host: He comes home.
[00:31:25.661 - 00:31:26.002] Unknown: Yes.
[00:31:26.146 - 00:31:34.216] Host: So I'm having a conversation with him downstairs when he, when I was going for my walk and, you know, and he's saying, whatever, whatever, but he's earning 1,20,000, 1,40,000 a year, right?
[00:31:34.976 - 00:31:37.520] Host: Or in that zone.
[00:31:38.180 - 00:31:40.643] Host: But he wouldn't have been able to do it before.
[00:31:41.004 - 00:31:47.932] Host: But if he's now not thinking that, wow, I am blessed to have got this job in the first place, what am I going to do with it?
[00:31:48.793 - 00:31:49.714] Host: Then we have a problem.
[00:31:49.922 - 00:31:51.584] Host: So we want to get to the DNA of that.
[00:31:51.844 - 00:31:57.111] Host: And my conversation with some of the delivery boys are, this is your today's job, but what are you doing for the next three years?
[00:31:57.552 - 00:32:00.515] Host: Because if you don't want to do this, then what are you going to do?
[00:32:00.836 - 00:32:02.237] Host: Who's going to offer you a job?
[00:32:02.317 - 00:32:03.599] Host: Why do you think you need to do that?
[00:32:03.659 - 00:32:11.489] Host: What are you doing every single day versus I'm a driver in a car, but I'm actually taking an online course.
[00:32:11.809 - 00:32:15.194] Host: And I'm taking an online course, and it's kidding, because I want to do something else.
[00:32:15.574 - 00:32:18.738] Host: I mean, that's raw ambition.
[00:32:18.882 - 00:32:21.887] Guest: Basically that restlessness needs to be built in at all times.
[00:32:22.067 - 00:32:22.648] Host: Yeah.
[00:32:22.968 - 00:32:23.329] Host: Yeah.
[00:32:23.349 - 00:32:27.575] Host: When I didn't have the money, I was a, I was doing an usher for a Dara Singh wrestling match.
[00:32:30.500 - 00:32:37.070] Host: For many Sundays, for about three years, I used to be at the NSCI here in Mumbai, which was in the dome at that stage.
[00:32:37.271 - 00:32:40.816] Host: And that's where the wrestling matches take place every Saturday, Sunday.
[00:32:41.337 - 00:32:42.098] Host: And I was an usher.
[00:32:43.426 - 00:32:44.247] Host: But why?
[00:32:44.287 - 00:32:47.871] Host: Because necessity is the mother of invention in that context.
[00:32:48.011 - 00:32:48.292] Host: Why?
[00:32:48.412 - 00:32:50.674] Host: Because you needed that little sense of pocket money.
[00:32:50.695 - 00:32:54.960] Host: I didn't have a sense of entitlement that if I wanted to do that, my parents had to give me something there.
[00:32:54.980 - 00:32:55.861] Host: That's raw ambition.
[00:32:56.581 - 00:33:10.738] Guest: When you work with the Swadesh Foundation, which has done amazing work, and you've also at the same time, through the course of your career over these several decades, built great value with private sector organizations, are you also looking at
[00:33:11.170 - 00:33:13.312] Guest: social sector impact in the same way?
[00:33:13.412 - 00:33:14.333] Guest: I want to see the results.
[00:33:14.373 - 00:33:15.294] Guest: I want to see the numbers.
[00:33:15.314 - 00:33:18.938] Guest: Is that the way social sector impact should be run?
[00:33:18.978 - 00:33:20.859] Host: Yeah, that's a very good question.
[00:33:21.080 - 00:33:23.722] Host: And we've actually failed on that a lot.
[00:33:24.042 - 00:33:36.374] Host: Because in the first four or five years when we scaled up Swades Foundation, after we were operating on a small scale, and then when we divested UTV to Disney, then we started really scaling up what we wanted to do in the not-for-profit sector.
[00:33:36.394 - 00:33:40.178] Host: For the first five years, we did put targets as entrepreneurs.
[00:33:40.290 - 00:33:48.559] Host: And actually that boomeranged on us because here you're going to a community, you've got to go with the community to see what they want to do and they need to own it.
[00:33:48.759 - 00:33:53.985] Host: But if you suddenly feel I have a target to give back, then they'll say, sure, come on in.
[00:33:54.385 - 00:33:55.186] Host: You want to build a toilet?
[00:33:55.226 - 00:33:55.647] Host: Come on in.
[00:33:55.667 - 00:33:56.808] Host: You want to give me water?
[00:33:56.848 - 00:33:57.268] Host: Come on in.
[00:33:57.288 - 00:33:59.250] Host: You want to actually do water for irrigation?
[00:33:59.331 - 00:33:59.771] Host: Come on in.
[00:34:00.011 - 00:34:00.812] Host: Sure, sure, sure.
[00:34:01.413 - 00:34:04.656] Host: And I think that failed because that ownership, no skin in the game.
[00:34:05.437 - 00:34:08.580] Host: And, you know, they get doles, they get grants from the government.
[00:34:08.761 - 00:34:10.002] Host: This is one more of those.
[00:34:10.306 - 00:34:19.917] Host: So to your question, I think, is the context in India the ability for us to be able to give back and work with the underprivileged?
[00:34:19.937 - 00:34:24.021] Host: And I wouldn't even call them underprivileged, actually, frankly, to be honest, because I think that's not the case.
[00:34:24.061 - 00:34:26.003] Host: Everyone has a sense of ambition.
[00:34:26.524 - 00:34:35.794] Host: And there's enough raw ambition in rural India I've seen than many parts of the entitled part that I've seen in cities.
[00:34:36.386 - 00:34:39.310] Host: That raw ambition is whatever I want to do, I don't have it.
[00:34:39.370 - 00:34:42.894] Host: So I'm going to treasure every single moment of it.
[00:34:43.354 - 00:34:49.242] Host: And when I have it, I'm going to come back and give it back to my community because they're the ones that supported me when I didn't have it.
[00:34:50.123 - 00:34:52.305] Host: That to me is also a definition of raw ambition.
[00:34:53.046 - 00:34:55.409] Host: So I think, yeah, that's what it would be.
[00:34:55.970 - 00:35:02.738] Guest: And also the challenge within social sector impact where, yes, we've managed to reach these many people now, but
[00:35:02.850 - 00:35:05.714] Guest: 10 years down the line, is it still creating impact?
[00:35:05.754 - 00:35:07.095] Guest: What happened to those people?
[00:35:07.716 - 00:35:09.839] Guest: Is there a need then to track that impact as well?
[00:35:09.859 - 00:35:15.867] Host: Yeah, I think that the core of the Swades Foundation model for us is really to measure impact, which is easy to do.
[00:35:15.927 - 00:35:20.192] Host: It's not that easy to do, but it is easy to do because it's a must to do and most people don't do it.
[00:35:20.653 - 00:35:23.757] Host: But it is about making permanent change.
[00:35:24.498 - 00:35:30.706] Host: All of us in our lives, we need to make, you know, what we were doing five years back, we can't keep doing today, right?
[00:35:31.010 - 00:35:35.937] Host: That's evolution, and the question is if you're doing everything that you were doing five years back today, you're a question that.
[00:35:36.498 - 00:35:42.486] Host: You may be in the same job, you may be looking differently, but the way you do it, how you've grown as an individual, all of that may happen, right?
[00:35:42.927 - 00:35:54.042] Host: And I think that's pretty much what you would do with any environment where you're working with people who you're building and working to take to the next level of ambition.
[00:35:54.743 - 00:35:56.786] Guest: I want to ask you about your EduTech.
[00:35:56.866 - 00:35:57.487] Guest: company.
[00:35:57.507 - 00:36:00.030] Host: I don't know about the tech part.
[00:36:00.070 - 00:36:05.878] Host: I think Edutek came about when a few companies wanted to raise a lot of money and they just thought they wanted to call it tech.
[00:36:06.018 - 00:36:11.546] Host: But yeah, you're talking about the company that we're building which is in skilling, it's in forever learning and yeah.
[00:36:11.886 - 00:36:23.282] Guest: Okay, so the interesting part for me was you wrote alongside on a track when this whole Edutek boom happened and there was a lot of money chasing that idea and the boom and then
[00:36:23.458 - 00:36:27.162] Guest: the inevitable bust happened after that.
[00:36:27.883 - 00:36:36.614] Guest: And you've got an organization, you've built almost an institution that's running alongside, almost unaffected by all of this.
[00:36:37.074 - 00:36:39.938] Host: You're talking about is Upgrad unaffected by all of what?
[00:36:40.158 - 00:36:48.568] Host: The hubri about 12 select investors backing four select entrepreneurs in a population of 1.4 billion.
[00:36:48.669 - 00:36:50.190] Host: That hubri?
[00:36:50.671 - 00:36:53.234] Host: Yeah, we didn't hear much about that hubri.
[00:36:53.346 - 00:36:59.275] Host: because it was 12 investors investing in four entrepreneurs when there's 1.4 billion people in this country.
[00:36:59.695 - 00:37:02.880] Guest: And what is UpGrad's focus right now?
[00:37:02.900 - 00:37:11.232] Host: Well, I think it's the focus that we started and the vision that we started almost seven, eight years back in the same context where nobody's going to be job ready on day one.
[00:37:11.393 - 00:37:13.596] Host: Everyone needs to be job ready every single day.
[00:37:13.776 - 00:37:19.064] Host: And we're in that business to remind you that you're not job ready every time you think you're job ready.
[00:37:20.386 - 00:37:23.250] Guest: So basically, even if you've finished your
[00:37:23.330 - 00:37:28.200] Guest: your graduation and your post-graduation, you've got the job, you still constantly need to scale.
[00:37:28.220 - 00:37:32.689] Host: Even if you finished a great meeting and got a promotion, you have to do that.
[00:37:32.709 - 00:37:33.871] Host: You have to constantly scale.
[00:37:33.891 - 00:37:38.260] Host: Even if you're earning 20 lakhs, 40 lakhs or 60 lakhs, you have to do that.
[00:37:38.520 - 00:37:43.630] Host: Even if you think you've got a corner office, though I think the corner office myth has gone away, you need to do that.
[00:37:44.171 - 00:37:45.554] Host: Even if everything.
[00:37:47.266 - 00:37:54.454] Guest: There's another interesting sort of debate that's now kicking up about young people saying, do I really need the MBA?
[00:37:54.975 - 00:38:08.190] Guest: Has that sort of at 21, 22 when I graduate from university with either an engineering degree or a bachelor's of commerce or B.Com, the route maybe 20 years ago was to do an MBA.
[00:38:09.031 - 00:38:10.372] Guest: Would you advise that route anymore?
[00:38:10.572 - 00:38:11.954] Guest: Does it still make sense?
[00:38:12.930 - 00:38:23.603] Host: So I don't want to get the mess that Nikhil Kamath got into because I think he meant it in the absolutely right, nonchalant spirit and the way he communicates and talks.
[00:38:23.623 - 00:38:25.125] Host: So I completely have full respect for that.
[00:38:26.006 - 00:38:36.338] Host: But let me just put, I mean, I'm not the best person to talk about that because when I wanted to be an entrepreneur, the only advice at that stage, rightly so, that my parents, my father said is, look,
[00:38:36.706 - 00:38:43.155] Host: okay, fine, if you finally want to be an entrepreneur, why don't you just do your MBA or your child accountancy and then decide whether you want to be an entrepreneur?
[00:38:43.175 - 00:38:47.181] Host: Because at least you'll have a bank, you'll have something to fall back on.
[00:38:47.641 - 00:38:49.804] Host: And if I had done that, I wouldn't be an entrepreneur.
[00:38:49.824 - 00:38:54.591] Host: Because I would have gone with plan B, I would have failed, which I did fail every year for many, many things.
[00:38:54.811 - 00:38:56.874] Host: And I would have gone back and said, no, this is not for me.
[00:38:57.535 - 00:38:58.977] Host: So the fact that I didn't have that.
[00:38:59.017 - 00:39:05.426] Host: So I think for each one, again, you have to figure out, are you doing this because it's just part of a process
[00:39:05.666 - 00:39:10.711] Host: partly because your family has done that, partly because your parents have done that, and therefore you need to do that.
[00:39:10.751 - 00:39:12.533] Host: It's a chest-thumping moment.
[00:39:13.014 - 00:39:14.956] Host: It's formal from your school crowd.
[00:39:15.596 - 00:39:17.939] Host: It's actually gonna be an important part of your CV.
[00:39:18.179 - 00:39:23.124] Host: You actually feel you don't know how to think about marketing, Excel, cheating, and you need an MBA.
[00:39:23.245 - 00:39:24.626] Host: And an MBA is a placeholder.
[00:39:25.046 - 00:39:26.088] Host: You can have a specialized one.
[00:39:26.148 - 00:39:29.491] Host: Why do we keep putting MBA as the only benchmark?
[00:39:29.511 - 00:39:32.274] Host: Right, because as a doctor, you can't be a doctor
[00:39:32.482 - 00:39:37.988] Host: unless you have an MBA or an MD, and you can't be a financial accountant unless you do your CA.
[00:39:38.628 - 00:39:40.571] Host: MBA has this soft feel about it, right?
[00:39:40.591 - 00:39:44.895] Host: I mean, you can be successful without an MBA, but you can't be successful as a doctor without being an MD.
[00:39:45.336 - 00:39:49.380] Host: So that's why if you look at just the MBA context, that's why it's personal.
[00:39:49.920 - 00:39:52.883] Host: If you believe you want that, then you should go ahead and do it.
[00:39:53.925 - 00:39:58.269] Host: Will you have to unlearn at least 50 to 60% of everything you learn?
[00:39:58.449 - 00:39:59.090] Host: Absolutely.
[00:39:59.586 - 00:40:01.589] Host: But that doesn't mean that it was a waste of time.
[00:40:01.790 - 00:40:03.933] Host: Unlearning does not mean zeroing.
[00:40:04.273 - 00:40:08.120] Host: I think people look at unlearning saying, oh, I wasted two years because I need to unlearn.
[00:40:08.140 - 00:40:14.450] Host: No, a lot of unlearning is the process of actually, it's like any other manufacturing process.
[00:40:14.470 - 00:40:18.236] Host: You take a pineapple and you pulp it out and you get a certain situation.
[00:40:18.776 - 00:40:21.461] Host: You can't say that I don't need the pineapple because all I needed was the pulp.
[00:40:21.481 - 00:40:24.786] Host: So sometimes you need to go through the process to learn to unlearn.
[00:40:24.962 - 00:40:26.247] Host: And that's a growing up process.
[00:40:26.287 - 00:40:29.278] Host: So I would say there is no one size fits all.
[00:40:29.519 - 00:40:30.865] Host: If that's what you want to do, do it.
[00:40:31.547 - 00:40:32.631] Host: But do it for the right reason.
[00:40:33.675 - 00:40:34.418] Host: And I think
[00:40:34.498 - 00:40:38.683] Host: Today, more and more people are saying, I'll be in work experience for four to five years, and then I'll do it.
[00:40:38.763 - 00:40:40.185] Host: But then you have context.
[00:40:40.205 - 00:40:41.807] Host: In the beginning, people didn't have context.
[00:40:41.827 - 00:40:42.989] Host: So you can do that with context.
[00:40:43.349 - 00:40:48.756] Host: I think the third thing on MBAs, because it's a broad label, you can do an MBA in data analytics.
[00:40:48.776 - 00:40:51.099] Host: You can do an MBA in anything today from that point.
[00:40:51.119 - 00:40:53.602] Host: So that whole cliched context is there.
[00:40:53.622 - 00:40:57.067] Host: So it gives you a lot of diversity for what you want to do that for.
[00:40:57.567 - 00:40:59.730] Host: And look, the optionality is actually
[00:41:00.258 - 00:41:14.455] Host: if, you know, and I'm not, it's not a plug for me in UpGrad, the best way you should do it is online, because you should continue with your, imagine doing an MBA online, finishing that one chapter, getting a lot of peer input.
[00:41:14.515 - 00:41:23.986] Host: We have a class of 600 people, we get peer inputs from so many people, and Monday morning you get into your office and you're in a meeting, and you can actually start inputting what you learned
[00:41:24.226 - 00:41:26.910] Host: You won't get that from doing an offline MBA.
[00:41:26.930 - 00:41:39.270] Host: So I'm just saying, the MBA cliched context here is just this one flaunting horse, a flocking horse, so to speak, which people look at, versus other degrees where you just need it as a minimum qualification.
[00:41:40.693 - 00:41:50.068] Guest: The other sort of admired, celebrated portion of being an entrepreneur is the exit, the big exit that entrepreneurs tend to get.
[00:41:50.528 - 00:41:51.570] Guest: Admired by who?
[00:41:51.778 - 00:41:57.547] Guest: by the people who then look at the money and say, wow, that's a good amount of money for you to walk away with.
[00:41:57.587 - 00:42:01.473] Host: But I'm entitled to ask the question to your question.
[00:42:01.513 - 00:42:03.075] Host: I'm very mad by who?
[00:42:03.095 - 00:42:04.177] Guest: By the general public.
[00:42:04.517 - 00:42:07.221] Guest: Oh, look, you know, this person sold their company for 300 crore rupees.
[00:42:07.242 - 00:42:09.084] Guest: 300 crore rupees is much too much.
[00:42:09.205 - 00:42:09.866] Guest: It's an achievement.
[00:42:09.926 - 00:42:11.248] Guest: It's an achievement.
[00:42:11.448 - 00:42:13.491] Guest: You've had a series of exits as well.
[00:42:13.531 - 00:42:16.656] Guest: There was the Bloomberg exit, the Disney exit.
[00:42:17.978 - 00:42:19.240] Guest: I do want to ask you about Disney.
[00:42:19.260 - 00:42:20.722] Guest: It was a big deal.
[00:42:20.994 - 00:42:27.843] Guest: back then in the media space, we were all in the media space, all looking at it saying, wow, that's massive.
[00:42:27.863 - 00:42:32.530] Guest: Can you tell us how that deal came about after all of those years of building that organization?
[00:42:32.770 - 00:42:40.320] Host: Yeah, I mean, I think the first way is one was around for the longest time and out there to outlast and one did.
[00:42:40.360 - 00:42:46.188] Host: The second one was, I think I've been fortunate enough to have a little bit more of a broader global perspective.
[00:42:46.769 - 00:42:47.410] Host: And I think
[00:42:47.490 - 00:42:57.422] Host: you know, my entrepreneurial hat with my creative hat versus being completely obsessed only with creativity gave me the sense of scale that allowed you to look at models that worked around the world.
[00:42:57.843 - 00:43:02.489] Host: And I think we were blessed to first partner with Murdoch and Newscorp, then data with Bloomberg, and then with Disney.
[00:43:03.009 - 00:43:08.796] Host: And I think over the six years that we had a phenomenal relationship there, at the end of the day, so two things I would say.
[00:43:08.917 - 00:43:11.300] Host: One is, you know, three things I would say.
[00:43:11.360 - 00:43:13.282] Host: One is you stick around in our class.
[00:43:13.883 - 00:43:16.466] Host: Second, you don't pop the question of when you want to exit.
[00:43:16.706 - 00:43:18.128] Host: Somebody else needs to do that.
[00:43:18.148 - 00:43:21.412] Host: So I don't think I had the idea that I wanted to exit.
[00:43:21.433 - 00:43:31.166] Host: That came about in a normal conversation that just sounded synergistic, where we have a significant strategic shareholder that says, we're doing something on our own, you're doing something on your own, why don't we all put it together?
[00:43:31.466 - 00:43:31.947] Host: Makes sense.
[00:43:32.648 - 00:43:35.232] Host: And I think that would be the second one as far as that.
[00:43:35.472 - 00:43:42.221] Host: And the third one is you can be extremely involved and passionate about what you want to do in a work life, but you can't be emotional about it.
[00:43:42.702 - 00:43:42.962] Unknown: Right.
[00:43:43.443 - 00:43:45.746] Host: And if you can do that, and if you can segregate the two,
[00:43:46.018 - 00:43:48.763] Host: the decisions will be quite natural for you.
[00:43:49.324 - 00:43:53.991] Guest: So was it difficult, hard, okay to let go because you had built something?
[00:43:55.213 - 00:44:02.406] Host: Yeah, I mean, the emotional part would be, you know, that constant sense of whatever, but not regret.
[00:44:02.506 - 00:44:06.773] Host: I don't think the word regret would come in there because once you've taken that decision, then you're moving on from there.
[00:44:06.793 - 00:44:07.394] Guest: Then you're moving on.
[00:44:07.414 - 00:44:08.175] Host: Yeah, then you are.
[00:44:08.315 - 00:44:12.242] Guest: So was there ever an element of looking over your shoulder saying, oh, they're running that wrong?
[00:44:12.802 - 00:44:13.743] Host: Am I doing something wrong?
[00:44:13.963 - 00:44:14.985] Guest: Are they doing something wrong?
[00:44:15.005 - 00:44:20.331] Guest: So you've handed over this company that you built with raw ambition and love and all of these things you've nurtured.
[00:44:20.872 - 00:44:22.874] Guest: Now, someone else is running it.
[00:44:23.515 - 00:44:26.399] Guest: Did you look over your shoulders saying, I wish they were doing that differently?
[00:44:26.499 - 00:44:27.320] Guest: Oh, that was a mistake.
[00:44:27.340 - 00:44:28.181] Guest: They shouldn't be doing that.
[00:44:28.561 - 00:44:28.922] Host: No.
[00:44:28.942 - 00:44:29.082] Host: No.
[00:44:29.262 - 00:44:29.903] Host: You just walk away.
[00:44:29.923 - 00:44:32.006] Host: Once you move on, then that's the element of that.
[00:44:32.306 - 00:44:38.073] Host: See, but just to clarify that, no, the idea is not for you after you've done that.
[00:44:38.393 - 00:44:38.834] Host: It's like,
[00:44:39.458 - 00:44:40.339] Host: You've got an apartment.
[00:44:40.540 - 00:44:41.361] Host: You sell the apartment.
[00:44:41.421 - 00:44:46.929] Host: Imagine going hovering around every night, taking an ice cream and hovering around and saying, what are they doing to this place?
[00:44:47.170 - 00:44:49.433] Host: You sold the apartment.
[00:44:49.493 - 00:44:50.935] Host: Now move on with life, right?
[00:44:50.955 - 00:44:52.037] Host: You think it's a bad example?
[00:44:52.057 - 00:44:55.262] Host: No, that was your home for 20 years.
[00:44:55.362 - 00:44:56.584] Host: You sold it to somebody else.
[00:44:56.624 - 00:45:00.189] Host: Would you go every time with an ice cream, sit below there and say, what are they doing to my home?
[00:45:00.229 - 00:45:00.850] Host: You wouldn't.
[00:45:01.314 - 00:45:01.835] Host: It's great.
[00:45:01.955 - 00:45:03.016] Host: I lived here for 20 years.
[00:45:03.056 - 00:45:03.797] Host: Great memories.
[00:45:03.857 - 00:45:05.038] Host: Now somebody else is living here.
[00:45:05.198 - 00:45:06.079] Host: Great memories for them.
[00:45:06.119 - 00:45:07.280] Host: That's how you should look at it.
[00:45:07.340 - 00:45:10.083] Host: And that's the real, that's really when you exit.
[00:45:10.684 - 00:45:16.069] Host: But I think sometimes in global, the people who come in there, it's not whether they're right or wrong.
[00:45:16.429 - 00:45:22.636] Host: Their agendas change and M&A's require the pursuit of the original vision to quite an extent.
[00:45:22.736 - 00:45:24.938] Host: If that goes away, then it can be sidetracked.
[00:45:25.779 - 00:45:28.722] Guest: You, you built a lot of, uh,
[00:45:28.802 - 00:45:30.764] Guest: you know, a lot of that structure with your wife.
[00:45:30.844 - 00:45:34.589] Guest: You were co-creators, is that the correct term?
[00:45:34.609 - 00:45:45.542] Guest: Was there ever a project of which you stood at opposite ends and, you know, it really tested your ability to work together as partners and as husband and wife?
[00:45:46.163 - 00:45:46.403] Host: Yeah.
[00:45:46.423 - 00:45:50.308] Host: Well, firstly, just to clarify that entire journey, I don't think we were married before.
[00:45:50.348 - 00:45:54.332] Host: So our creative journeys started in theater as a hobby, for example.
[00:45:54.913 - 00:45:55.794] Host: That's how we met.
[00:45:55.874 - 00:45:58.157] Host: but life changed in a different way.
[00:45:58.637 - 00:46:00.960] Host: And I think much later on, we got married.
[00:46:01.460 - 00:46:06.586] Host: So I think the creative was first established, the relationship was second established.
[00:46:06.946 - 00:46:16.657] Host: I think in the media part, the context of friction or anything else was much less because actually we kind of divided by broadcasting was something she would be looking at more.
[00:46:16.717 - 00:46:20.381] Host: And I was looking at everything else from a corporate point of view, the film studio and everything else.
[00:46:20.842 - 00:46:24.626] Host: So I think we got our paths quite clear.
[00:46:24.706 - 00:46:28.590] Host: I think both of us were very clear that this is not our company.
[00:46:28.730 - 00:46:32.214] Host: The day you have one more investor, it's no longer your company.
[00:46:32.254 - 00:46:34.297] Host: Then you are the roles that you're playing.
[00:46:34.517 - 00:46:45.309] Host: And I would say to her credit at that stage, even when she was a creative director in the broadcasting business, we had a great chief executive officer who came in and she was reporting into that chief executive officer.
[00:46:45.389 - 00:46:47.391] Host: Now, one would say, how is a founder going to do that?
[00:46:47.531 - 00:46:51.255] Host: And I think that's how you build long-term value into organizations.
[00:46:51.295 - 00:46:52.136] Host: And you look at it that way.
[00:46:52.537 - 00:46:53.778] Host: As much as I felt,
[00:46:54.306 - 00:46:56.489] Host: At some stage, I may have owned 100% of the company.
[00:46:56.749 - 00:47:00.154] Host: By the time I sold to Disney, we had about 24, 25%.
[00:47:00.715 - 00:47:04.140] Host: But the minute you go with that gap, you know you're working for a board.
[00:47:04.180 - 00:47:07.965] Host: So at any given stage, they can say, you're not the right person to take the company forward.
[00:47:08.846 - 00:47:11.290] Host: Then you're a shareholder and not a chief executive officer.
[00:47:11.811 - 00:47:18.580] Host: And many of us mix up ownership with this context that I own it all.
[00:47:21.244 - 00:47:22.866] Guest: The story of Hungama,
[00:47:23.170 - 00:47:25.694] Guest: This was, this was Serena's idea.
[00:47:25.754 - 00:47:28.760] Guest: She wanted to create a channel that didn't exist at that point.
[00:47:28.780 - 00:47:31.745] Guest: And a lot of people didn't see value in the idea.
[00:47:32.166 - 00:47:47.833] Host: Tell us how Hungama was built and how, you know, it actually was that we were, we were looking at, you know, having a, what I would call an American company or, and in that context, broadcasting as a channels was something that we wanted to get through.
[00:47:48.093 - 00:47:48.594] Host: So the,
[00:47:48.898 - 00:47:51.100] Host: The kids segment was something that was pretty open.
[00:47:51.480 - 00:47:56.685] Host: In a sense, it wasn't open because you had Nickelodeon and you had CNN Cartoon Network and then you had Disney.
[00:47:56.725 - 00:48:02.931] Host: So actually, it should have been a close case, but we actually felt from a local perspective, that would be the case.
[00:48:02.971 - 00:48:06.855] Host: So I think when she came in here, she had done more to kids shows for some of the other broadcasters.
[00:48:07.316 - 00:48:12.260] Host: So that was some knowledge that says these work much better than what the entire kids challenge work.
[00:48:13.021 - 00:48:17.385] Host: And when we were looking at brainstorming that, it was a target group that we felt was under exploited.
[00:48:17.765 - 00:48:18.386] Host: That was one.
[00:48:18.754 - 00:48:23.882] Host: I think for the first three or four or five months, we were doing what most entrepreneurs do, try and copy.
[00:48:24.363 - 00:48:27.488] Host: And then we realized it never works, shouldn't work, get out of it.
[00:48:28.109 - 00:48:35.941] Host: And that's when I think she took a trip to Japan and negotiated to bring Doraemon and Shinshan to India, which even till today I've got enough.
[00:48:36.502 - 00:48:39.206] Host: At least she has, and I have enough mothers that says, you know.
[00:48:39.567 - 00:48:40.228] Host: This is your fault.
[00:48:40.448 - 00:48:44.114] Host: Yeah, absolutely our fault that my kids are glued up to Shinshan and Doraemon.
[00:48:44.386 - 00:48:46.952] Host: And that was a good turning point along with one or two shows.
[00:48:47.052 - 00:48:48.134] Host: And I think that's what it takes.
[00:48:48.274 - 00:48:50.519] Host: Most people think it takes some huge strategy.
[00:48:50.539 - 00:48:54.628] Host: It takes three, four really savvy steps to turn things around.
[00:48:55.009 - 00:48:59.218] Guest: When you started making films as a film producer,
[00:48:59.458 - 00:49:04.205] Guest: You were actually at that point fairly corporate in an industry that was not so corporate.
[00:49:04.345 - 00:49:09.412] Guest: I mean, most producers were part of film families, they were part of that network.
[00:49:09.432 - 00:49:12.476] Guest: You were a complete outsider, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:49:12.677 - 00:49:17.543] Host: I was an outsider, not a corporate, but the outsider, yes.
[00:49:17.563 - 00:49:21.168] Host: And so therefore, I couldn't have this fluffy kind of conversation.
[00:49:21.229 - 00:49:22.290] Host: It wasn't one of those
[00:49:22.562 - 00:49:23.703] Host: let's do things together.
[00:49:23.803 - 00:49:25.064] Host: I'm on, I'm on, I'm on.
[00:49:25.144 - 00:49:29.389] Host: Yeah, I wasn't in that group that woke up and had a drink in the evening, said, you're doing this?
[00:49:29.529 - 00:49:29.869] Host: I'm on.
[00:49:29.909 - 00:49:30.930] Host: Whatever happens, I'm on.
[00:49:30.950 - 00:49:32.091] Host: Whatever the creative idea, I'm on.
[00:49:32.231 - 00:49:33.472] Host: So I was the outsider.
[00:49:33.492 - 00:49:35.575] Guest: What was that like in the beginning?
[00:49:36.976 - 00:49:38.718] Host: I don't know what the other part was like.
[00:49:38.778 - 00:49:42.481] Host: So I think I've never felt the other part and I've never really experienced the other part.
[00:49:42.501 - 00:49:43.822] Host: So I can't really say what it was like.
[00:49:43.842 - 00:49:48.006] Host: It was the only way I could see us being able to do anything in this sector.
[00:49:48.087 - 00:49:51.730] Host: Because when you're an outsider, it's very difficult to figure out what it is
[00:49:51.842 - 00:49:54.425] Host: to live in that home in that context.
[00:49:54.445 - 00:50:05.657] Host: But all I would say is what it was like is that it pushes you to incredible boundaries because you have to, if you can't beat them, join them doesn't apply to you.
[00:50:07.079 - 00:50:11.223] Host: So most of the cases where you feel if I can't beat them, join them, no.
[00:50:11.524 - 00:50:16.609] Host: In fact, that was the first thing to me that I can't do what everyone else here is doing in any case.
[00:50:16.889 - 00:50:20.113] Host: So for me to be one more person to do that is out of the question.
[00:50:20.133 - 00:50:21.074] Host: It's a bad strategy.
[00:50:21.506 - 00:50:26.413] Host: So once you put that as your benchmark and then you're the outsider, then you think of it in a very different manner.
[00:50:26.933 - 00:50:36.867] Host: And I think therefore in our early days, first five firms were complete absolute disasters and flops and 99% of the people who ever enter this sector would have exited that.
[00:50:36.887 - 00:50:42.955] Host: So it took a lot of resilience and self-confidence to say, I don't have a choice.
[00:50:43.296 - 00:50:48.082] Host: It's a little bit like if I'd done my MBA, the chances are I may not be, I've been an entrepreneur.
[00:50:48.450 - 00:50:49.331] Guest: But you didn't have a choice.
[00:50:49.351 - 00:50:50.372] Guest: You had your TV business.
[00:50:50.993 - 00:50:52.694] Guest: And then people said, but you're TV guys.
[00:50:52.714 - 00:50:53.856] Guest: Why don't you just stick to TV?
[00:50:53.956 - 00:50:56.158] Host: That's the conviction of raw ambition that you need.
[00:50:56.238 - 00:50:58.040] Host: Unless you think this was not for you.
[00:50:58.120 - 00:50:58.701] Host: And you're right.
[00:50:58.801 - 00:51:01.103] Host: Sometimes you need to pull the plug and walk away also.
[00:51:01.584 - 00:51:12.035] Host: But to me, the definition of a media company was that you can't really build a B2C brand by just being a broadcaster, but you needed to do it with a movie studio.
[00:51:12.055 - 00:51:14.037] Host: You needed to be that amalgam of situations.
[00:51:14.077 - 00:51:15.378] Host: And whether you like it or not,
[00:51:15.714 - 00:51:21.322] Host: It at any stage was never more than 25% of our revenue, but it was 75% of our perception.
[00:51:21.402 - 00:51:26.269] Host: You're having a nice conversation with Hungama, but mostly everyone would have a conversation about the films.
[00:51:26.289 - 00:51:28.191] Host: But I say there were nine other things that we were doing.
[00:51:28.612 - 00:51:41.490] Host: So on perception, I don't think we had a choice that we wanted to be a really valuable company and really high profile and really understand consumer needs that we should be out of this sector just because our first five films were complete disasters.
[00:51:42.338 - 00:51:43.479] Guest: I find that astounding.
[00:51:43.519 - 00:51:44.520] Guest: I think that's amazing.
[00:51:44.540 - 00:51:48.504] Guest: But let me, for our audience, it's actually so young that you don't know.
[00:51:49.005 - 00:51:55.271] Guest: Swadesh, Rangdi Vasanthi, Jodha, Akbar, Barfi, Chennai Express, Sky is Pink, Fiza, Lakshya, Nemseg.
[00:51:55.291 - 00:51:56.612] Guest: Iconic films.
[00:51:56.752 - 00:51:57.453] Guest: Yeah.
[00:51:57.733 - 00:52:02.758] Host: So was Aamir and so was A Vendus Day and so was Kosla Ka Kosla.
[00:52:02.778 - 00:52:04.540] Host: There were tons of others.
[00:52:04.880 - 00:52:10.546] Host: Paan Singh Tomal and many others that had a very different impact on different people.
[00:52:10.818 - 00:52:15.005] Guest: What was, I mean, was there a formula with which you chose your stories?
[00:52:15.205 - 00:52:19.913] Host: I think that outsider was, you start looking at younger talent.
[00:52:19.933 - 00:52:22.678] Host: And I think in the beginning, it was mostly first-time directors.
[00:52:22.718 - 00:52:24.120] Host: We worked with our younger talent.
[00:52:25.021 - 00:52:29.889] Host: But it's also, when you don't know, then you find your own axis.
[00:52:30.070 - 00:52:32.834] Host: And then stories have to appeal to you in a slightly more different manner.
[00:52:32.894 - 00:52:35.338] Host: You need to be a lot more gutsy about what you're backing.
[00:52:36.120 - 00:52:37.522] Host: But enough where,
[00:52:37.922 - 00:52:43.470] Host: We were in media, in broadcasting, and many other sectors for us to understand what consumers and audiences were looking for.
[00:52:43.530 - 00:52:48.899] Host: And I think we got it right more than we got it wrong, but we got it wrong also many, many, many times.
[00:52:48.919 - 00:52:54.707] Host: There were films that I would, you know, after the second rough cut, I knew, oh my God, we're in deep shit.
[00:52:55.168 - 00:53:03.340] Host: And I would say we were one of the only studios out of the 84 movies that we made in UTV before I moved out, where three never got released.
[00:53:03.881 - 00:53:06.245] Host: Oh, you just got it, and you said, this is not going anywhere.
[00:53:06.325 - 00:53:07.186] Host: Just buried it.
[00:53:07.330 - 00:53:11.658] Host: Which is not an easy thing because to bury a creative process is not an easy task.
[00:53:12.018 - 00:53:12.639] Host: And it's not the most.
[00:53:12.679 - 00:53:13.721] Host: I was not proud about it.
[00:53:13.801 - 00:53:16.967] Host: And, you know, you have to talk with creative talent who have given a lot of their time and effort.
[00:53:17.007 - 00:53:17.768] Host: It's not just money.
[00:53:19.111 - 00:53:21.755] Host: But, you know, that's it.
[00:53:21.775 - 00:53:23.999] Guest: So you've come back now with RSVP.
[00:53:24.059 - 00:53:27.826] Guest: You've made Uri, you made mismatched.
[00:53:27.906 - 00:53:30.950] Host: It or not, with the Sam Bahadur, we did a lot of interesting things.
[00:53:31.050 - 00:53:34.274] Guest: Is that because fundamentally in your heart, you're a storyteller and you can't turn it off?
[00:53:34.294 - 00:53:36.517] Host: Yeah, no, fundamentally I missed that.
[00:53:36.637 - 00:53:41.043] Host: And I think after the non-competitor five years went away and a few years later.
[00:53:41.704 - 00:53:44.548] Host: But I knew that this time as a passion, it was much more fun.
[00:53:45.209 - 00:53:49.394] Host: Because as a passion, you can say no much more often than you can say yes.
[00:53:49.570 - 00:53:53.335] Host: versus the business where every business has to be a logical decision.
[00:53:54.056 - 00:53:56.098] Host: But in a passion, it can be an emotional decision.
[00:53:56.138 - 00:53:56.819] Host: You want to play golf?
[00:53:56.939 - 00:53:59.162] Host: If you don't get up on Saturday morning, you don't have to play golf.
[00:54:00.243 - 00:54:03.828] Host: Not that I play golf at all, but yeah.
[00:54:03.848 - 00:54:10.316] Guest: You know, the idea of television and you did news, you did entertainment, you did films on television.
[00:54:10.977 - 00:54:13.059] Guest: Has linear television the way we knew it?
[00:54:14.001 - 00:54:14.441] Guest: Is it done?
[00:54:14.601 - 00:54:15.122] Guest: Is it over?
[00:54:15.618 - 00:54:17.361] Host: In a country like India, it's still working, right?
[00:54:17.401 - 00:54:22.831] Host: Because you still have that 300, 400 million middle of the pyramid that is still watching it.
[00:54:23.232 - 00:54:23.632] Host: Okay.
[00:54:23.692 - 00:54:26.838] Guest: But are they going to eventually, is everyone eventually going to migrate?
[00:54:27.259 - 00:54:32.007] Host: So I think the word television today still says a thing of something that's fixed on your wall.
[00:54:32.228 - 00:54:33.811] Host: So I think you need to move from that.
[00:54:34.412 - 00:54:39.160] Host: So will even rural India watch it on a different kind of a screen?
[00:54:39.320 - 00:54:40.242] Host: Yes.
[00:54:40.418 - 00:54:49.007] Host: Will the storytelling and the source be one which is from an OTT platform or somebody where you can do binge watching versus a broadcast channel or airwave?
[00:54:49.247 - 00:54:50.688] Host: I don't think that's extinct.
[00:54:50.708 - 00:54:54.452] Host: So if you look at that model in that context, the screen is going to evolve.
[00:54:54.492 - 00:54:56.334] Host: There's no question about that part.
[00:54:56.354 - 00:54:58.977] Host: And the consumption pattern may be more singular versus family.
[00:54:59.978 - 00:55:04.222] Host: And the subscription model versus the where you get it and which signal you get it from is going to evolve.
[00:55:04.242 - 00:55:08.146] Host: But storytelling at the core will remain as a good attraction
[00:55:08.290 - 00:55:10.453] Host: for everybody, for a long, long period of time.
[00:55:10.754 - 00:55:14.459] Host: And then that comes with the economics of it, right?
[00:55:14.539 - 00:55:21.029] Host: Because the economics is, the more the screen reduces, the less the advertising appeal to some extent.
[00:55:21.149 - 00:55:29.762] Host: Now, other than this mania that we have, when the whole world has moved on from cricket, we have this mania that, you know, and it's great, but it's a sport.
[00:55:29.802 - 00:55:35.090] Host: But unfortunately for us, we're not a sporting nation because we are so obsessed with cricket.
[00:55:35.298 - 00:55:39.484] Host: I wish it's fantastic to be obsessed with cricket, but that's why we're not a sporting nation.
[00:55:39.944 - 00:55:42.988] Host: That we're so obsessed with one sport and everyone's moved on from that.
[00:55:44.130 - 00:55:46.713] Host: And I think from that perspective here, that's a reflection.
[00:55:46.753 - 00:55:58.269] Host: So I'm saying other than, you know, sport where you would consume ads and you would do that, not in commensurate with the media rights you pay for it, but that's a different context altogether.
[00:55:58.469 - 00:56:01.253] Host: I think that's moved, but it's evolved in this particular manner.
[00:56:01.914 - 00:56:04.978] Host: The differentiation is now you can segregate much more.
[00:56:05.186 - 00:56:10.492] Host: because otherwise linear by nature means what it meets, right?
[00:56:10.532 - 00:56:18.042] Host: Everyone has to, whether you have that preference or not, the only thing you have is an off and on button, but you can't move to something else because it's linear.
[00:56:18.482 - 00:56:19.784] Host: But now everything is nonlinear.
[00:56:20.184 - 00:56:23.228] Host: So everything is moved, screen sign has changed, and it's nonlinear.
[00:56:24.910 - 00:56:32.779] Guest: So right now as an investor, as a business person, what do you find exciting about India?
[00:56:33.180 - 00:56:34.962] Host: I think firstly the opportunity here
[00:56:35.074 - 00:56:37.817] Host: And I know it's a cliche thing with everything as an opportunity.
[00:56:37.857 - 00:56:41.161] Host: I think that spotting raw ambition for me is a lot of fun.
[00:56:42.403 - 00:56:43.004] Host: Okay.
[00:56:43.024 - 00:56:47.008] Host: I think I have this high, high, high level of raw ambition.
[00:56:47.729 - 00:56:50.172] Host: And now I can enjoy it because I don't have a fund.
[00:56:50.352 - 00:57:00.485] Host: I'm just doing it for my personal resources and therefore the ability therefore to really be as selective as one want to be and back raw ambition is fun for me.
[00:57:00.745 - 00:57:02.147] Host: So that's maybe one criteria.
[00:57:02.768 - 00:57:04.850] Host: And yeah, where I think is the next
[00:57:04.994 - 00:57:16.067] Host: frontier or bastions of what could be in a place and the entrepreneur will be able to outlast most people is very, very important.
[00:57:16.127 - 00:57:19.671] Host: So because in a sector, all of these sectors are going to have herd mentality.
[00:57:19.791 - 00:57:22.314] Host: Can this person outlast in that context?
[00:57:22.455 - 00:57:24.978] Host: And is he have the raw ambition or she had the raw ambition?
[00:57:25.058 - 00:57:26.720] Host: And I think that's the combination.
[00:57:27.120 - 00:57:29.903] Host: And after that, I still know that I'll get six wrong and four right.
[00:57:31.365 - 00:57:32.146] Host: Even after all that.
[00:57:32.354 - 00:57:34.978] Host: A lot of people come to me and say, you know, I want to be an angel investor.
[00:57:34.998 - 00:57:35.879] Host: Do you have any advice?
[00:57:35.939 - 00:57:36.640] Host: I said, yeah.
[00:57:36.660 - 00:57:41.528] Host: Are you first ready to lose a lot of money before the fact that you may make a little bit of money?
[00:57:41.728 - 00:57:43.110] Host: Because if you're not, don't do it.
[00:57:43.611 - 00:57:53.946] Guest: And what is a little bit of money in, you know, compounded annual growth rate at this point compared to the stock market that's doing about 12-15% in a mutual fund annualized?
[00:57:54.107 - 00:57:54.307] Guest: Yeah.
[00:57:54.567 - 00:57:58.493] Guest: So someone who comes in saying, okay, I want to be an angel investor and I'm going to look through the stock.
[00:57:58.513 - 00:58:00.556] Host: But I want to be an angel investor for a different reason.
[00:58:00.617 - 00:58:01.618] Host: Sometimes you want to be
[00:58:01.698 - 00:58:02.779] Host: part of an ecosystem.
[00:58:03.540 - 00:58:16.896] Host: An engineer investor is not because your wealth manager sits at 9 a.m. and gives you a 12% proposal, and then private equity or stock market broker will give you a 16% IRR proposal, and now you think you can grow a trade.
[00:58:17.256 - 00:58:21.681] Host: So I think when you wanna be an engineer investor, if that's the only thing you're gonna do, watch out.
[00:58:22.282 - 00:58:29.330] Host: Because that could be, it depends if it's your hard earned living, but if it's a pool of what you want to do, that's perfectly fine.
[00:58:29.474 - 00:58:34.664] Host: But I think that, firstly, I don't think only is something that I would recommend for that.
[00:58:35.105 - 00:58:37.629] Host: And you're doing it for different reasons.
[00:58:37.710 - 00:58:39.273] Host: You want to be involved in the ecosystem.
[00:58:39.313 - 00:58:40.034] Host: You want to back it.
[00:58:40.054 - 00:58:42.499] Host: There's a sense of great personal satisfaction.
[00:58:42.519 - 00:58:46.386] Host: There is no satisfaction in owning mutual funds.
[00:58:46.594 - 00:58:47.175] Guest: That's not true.
[00:58:47.996 - 00:58:48.537] Host: That's not true?
[00:58:48.897 - 00:58:49.819] Host: What is the satisfaction?
[00:58:49.939 - 00:58:50.560] Guest: I kind of like it.
[00:58:50.860 - 00:58:54.265] Host: Yeah, what do you like about it?
[00:58:54.886 - 00:58:58.752] Host: It's a great way because frankly you are, no, no, no.
[00:58:58.772 - 00:59:00.274] Host: So let me be clear about this.
[00:59:00.435 - 00:59:02.778] Host: I get any backlash as far as I'm concerned.
[00:59:02.798 - 00:59:08.226] Host: As an instrument is phenomenal because it's giving you an organized value added process.
[00:59:08.907 - 00:59:11.211] Host: But is it fun is what I was trying to explain to you.
[00:59:11.231 - 00:59:12.553] Host: Not that is it intelligent.
[00:59:12.693 - 00:59:14.015] Host: Is it the smart thing to do?
[00:59:14.235 - 00:59:14.816] Host: Absolutely.
[00:59:14.836 - 00:59:16.178] Host: Is it fun?
[00:59:17.410 - 00:59:18.071] Host: You enjoy it?
[00:59:19.273 - 00:59:22.939] Host: You just enjoy the ring of the hey this just went up.
[00:59:23.199 - 00:59:32.835] Guest: I started when I was 24 with 500 rupees and then just it grew with me and you know, so this is maybe more a sense of pride than a sense of fun.
[00:59:33.115 - 00:59:39.025] Host: That I agree with you because fun is, you know, a very different definition.
[00:59:40.186 - 00:59:42.450] Host: And also, by the way, fun means you have to participate in it.
[00:59:42.562 - 00:59:47.054] Guest: Yes, you have to participate in the decision-making and the risk and stuff like that.
[00:59:47.154 - 00:59:47.415] Guest: It's true.
[00:59:47.776 - 00:59:55.276] Guest: You've actually, again, over several decades been an entrepreneur yourself and watched very closely as other entrepreneurs were growing.
[00:59:55.296 - 00:59:58.866] Guest: Do you find there is a change in
[00:59:59.074 - 01:00:06.843] Guest: ambition, structure, attitude of Gen Z entrepreneurs because they tend to be a very different generation than the rest of us.
[01:00:06.863 - 01:00:13.811] Host: They're wired differently, but I don't think this is one with that raw ambition, disproportionate to previous generations.
[01:00:13.891 - 01:00:18.696] Host: I think each one has their pros and cons and what we want to do, but they're wired differently.
[01:00:18.716 - 01:00:20.058] Host: The energy level is different.
[01:00:20.938 - 01:00:27.666] Host: You're seeing a sense of velocity and base to which things happen and therefore you feel it's
[01:00:27.970 - 01:00:29.011] Host: lot more live.
[01:00:29.592 - 01:00:29.692] Unknown: Okay.
[01:00:29.712 - 01:00:37.519] Host: And therefore you feel, you know, because they were at differently and there's a lot of velocity and pace and everything's changing around, this can't be the same as what it was.
[01:00:37.539 - 01:00:38.120] Unknown: Yes.
[01:00:38.140 - 01:00:50.992] Host: But was there the same sense of raw ambition for those with even bigger hurdles to cross at that stage that forced you to be a lot more frugal and more guaranteed to outlast people?
[01:00:51.012 - 01:00:52.473] Host: I think that was a little bit before.
[01:00:52.714 - 01:00:56.197] Host: There will be a few people, but I worry about whether everyone here will outlast each other.
[01:00:56.217 - 01:00:56.317] Unknown: Yeah.
[01:00:56.577 - 01:00:57.458] Guest: So I feel like
[01:00:57.634 - 01:01:02.980] Host: Not outlive each other, I just want to clarify because everyone thinks outlast sounds like outlived, not about outliving.
[01:01:03.781 - 01:01:08.467] Guest: Is there innovation that you find very interesting coming from tier 2, tier 3 rural India?
[01:01:08.867 - 01:01:09.067] Host: Yes.
[01:01:09.288 - 01:01:11.010] Host: Give me examples of what you've seen.
[01:01:11.070 - 01:01:24.786] Host: The reason for that is they're closer to the consumer, they're closer to the market, they're much more hung up to prove and do something, they don't have a sense of entitlement, they don't have the resources, they've been able to figure it out frugally,
[01:01:25.026 - 01:01:26.648] Host: And I think all of that makes a big difference.
[01:01:26.728 - 01:01:31.715] Host: But they're closer to the, they're closer, and you will also find a lot of jugad approach to that.
[01:01:31.735 - 01:01:36.401] Host: And again, I think that's not a great word for India to be labeled with.
[01:01:36.582 - 01:01:37.503] Host: It's a little bit like outsource.
[01:01:37.523 - 01:01:38.344] Host: That is not scalable.
[01:01:38.364 - 01:01:40.246] Host: Yeah, it's like, you know, we are being a great outsource.
[01:01:40.266 - 01:01:41.829] Host: Now we don't want to be an outsource camp.
[01:01:41.869 - 01:01:45.013] Host: We don't want to be a labor arbitrage country to anybody in the world.
[01:01:45.033 - 01:01:51.982] Host: Neither do we want to be a jugad because jugad sounds, see, entrepreneurial zeal velocity is very, very different from taking shortcuts.
[01:01:53.284 - 01:01:54.866] Guest: Is the,
[01:01:55.234 - 01:01:58.138] Guest: And you did say labor arbitrage and the outsourcing.
[01:01:58.939 - 01:02:01.603] Guest: More countries around the world right now becoming protectionists.
[01:02:02.464 - 01:02:05.848] Guest: America is very obviously, but others are also.
[01:02:05.868 - 01:02:09.033] Host: And as I would say, God bless America.
[01:02:09.453 - 01:02:12.197] Host: They say themselves as they're parting face everywhere else.
[01:02:12.437 - 01:02:21.710] Host: And I'm saying, yeah, you should echo it a lot more because I think you will need God to bless America at this point in time.
[01:02:22.811 - 01:02:23.852] Guest: How much honest is that?
[01:02:23.892 - 01:02:25.074] Guest: I mean, put on
[01:02:25.218 - 01:02:38.899] Guest: like the work that you're doing, which is skilling our people, making sure we're building market, making sure we're innovating so that, I mean, we're able to look after ourselves when these countries close their doors or slap tariffs on whatever we're sending.
[01:02:38.939 - 01:02:40.982] Host: I don't think anyone will be able to close the doors.
[01:02:41.563 - 01:02:41.684] Guest: Right.
[01:02:41.704 - 01:02:43.546] Guest: They wouldn't be able to survive if their doors were closed.
[01:02:43.566 - 01:02:48.694] Host: We said, we humans, as you called us, are not going to stand for anyone closing the doors.
[01:02:48.895 - 01:02:51.058] Host: Yes, you will have this artificial
[01:02:51.234 - 01:02:54.559] Host: context of visa restrictions and whatever else.
[01:02:54.619 - 01:02:58.665] Host: And each one, by the way, each country should do exactly what they necessarily want to do there.
[01:02:59.426 - 01:03:01.149] Host: But I think that's not very, very different.
[01:03:01.189 - 01:03:04.113] Host: Has the entire geopolitical situation changed here right now?
[01:03:04.734 - 01:03:05.395] Host: Yes, it has.
[01:03:05.856 - 01:03:07.278] Host: But let's put it this way.
[01:03:07.478 - 01:03:16.552] Host: If you look at China and what they wanted to do, they've gone about in a completely, no other country would like to actually do the way they may have done it.
[01:03:16.952 - 01:03:19.196] Host: But nobody can not admire in which they've done it.
[01:03:19.376 - 01:03:20.658] Host: And the end result is,
[01:03:20.834 - 01:03:28.406] Host: the people there and the citizens and everyone else, they may be a little feeling a little claustrophobic and they may be freedom of speech.
[01:03:28.506 - 01:03:28.826] Host: I don't know.
[01:03:28.846 - 01:03:30.269] Host: I'm not here to comment on that.
[01:03:30.749 - 01:03:33.814] Host: But their economic liberation would not have happened in a different manner.
[01:03:33.934 - 01:03:39.503] Host: So each one, I think, has to bring their own destiny for what they necessarily want to do.
[01:03:40.224 - 01:03:47.395] Host: I mean, I think, you know, the most powerful tool of leadership in today's day and age is being unpredictable.
[01:03:48.917 - 01:03:49.458] Host: And I think
[01:03:49.538 - 01:03:54.184] Host: you know, if you look at the President of the United States, I think his key forte is being unpredictable.
[01:03:54.525 - 01:03:59.291] Host: And the point is, if you're a pathological, unpredictable person, then that can get extremely destructive.
[01:03:59.932 - 01:04:04.338] Host: But on the other side, I would say 30%, he's put the world on notice.
[01:04:04.778 - 01:04:04.999] Guest: Yes.
[01:04:05.279 - 01:04:08.443] Guest: So everyone has gone to the negotiating table with him.
[01:04:08.463 - 01:04:11.607] Host: No, so that I think is a different compulsion.
[01:04:11.888 - 01:04:14.451] Host: But at least he's put people on notice.
[01:04:14.691 - 01:04:16.594] Host: So sometimes unpredictability,
[01:04:16.834 - 01:04:24.223] Host: As I said, if it's unpredictable every single day, and you don't know when this person is going to walk in as my leader and keep saying something, that can be horrendous and negative.
[01:04:24.903 - 01:04:26.105] Host: But it's also putting on notice.
[01:04:26.165 - 01:04:33.113] Host: If I say, I'm not going to put in more money here in NATO because XYZ, it's putting other people on notice saying, now let's all grow up and make those calls.
[01:04:33.153 - 01:04:38.279] Host: The place for the United Nations is kind of gone.
[01:04:39.020 - 01:04:44.146] Host: It's a nice, respectful institution, incredible institution, great for making speeches.
[01:04:45.026 - 01:04:46.408] Host: They didn't stop the Iraq war.
[01:04:46.788 - 01:04:48.630] Host: They haven't stopped any other war after that.
[01:04:48.710 - 01:04:50.752] Host: They've not been able to do in any context.
[01:04:51.313 - 01:04:53.415] Host: So should they not exist?
[01:04:53.575 - 01:04:54.136] Host: Absolutely.
[01:04:54.296 - 01:04:57.320] Host: Is there a certain value to each of those systems?
[01:04:57.360 - 01:04:59.522] Host: But they're getting less relevant.
[01:04:59.542 - 01:05:03.687] Host: So the United Nations is getting less relevant in that context.
[01:05:03.707 - 01:05:06.570] Host: And then you've got different connotations from there.
[01:05:06.590 - 01:05:10.514] Host: I think this is going to be a natural progression that
[01:05:10.786 - 01:05:16.753] Host: Countries may get a little bit more nationalistic, but that does not mean borders are closing down in that context.
[01:05:17.493 - 01:05:27.264] Host: Yes, we have certain immigration restrictions that have happened, but countries should be entitled to take what they want to do because they have to look after their own citizens in that point.
[01:05:27.765 - 01:05:33.090] Host: But for India, I think it's a phenomenal opportunity because we're a land of 1.4 billion people in many ways.
[01:05:33.171 - 01:05:35.373] Host: So it's not like we want more people to come here.
[01:05:35.894 - 01:05:40.018] Host: But I think the fact that there's nothing wrong with our people
[01:05:40.098 - 01:05:45.365] Host: The great part today is we don't really care whether the visas are not there for us to do.
[01:05:45.385 - 01:05:49.570] Host: Most of the people who want to go abroad and study want to come back.
[01:05:49.590 - 01:05:53.075] Host: So actually everything here, in my opinion, is only benefited with India.
[01:05:54.036 - 01:06:03.488] Guest: In the meantime though, while we are talking about, you know, people going overseas to study but wanting to come back because India is where the opportunities are.
[01:06:04.269 - 01:06:08.274] Guest: We're also, as a country at this point, failing on other points.
[01:06:08.450 - 01:06:17.566] Guest: Air pollution, for example, quality of life in terms of clean air, clean water, the roads on which your kids can go to school and come back, not get stuck in traffic.
[01:06:17.586 - 01:06:21.753] Guest: Just being able to walk down the street and have a decent footpath, it's not going to collapse under you.
[01:06:22.475 - 01:06:29.307] Guest: Are we dropping the ball here because there is an opportunity to build great cities of the future?
[01:06:31.030 - 01:06:33.554] Host: Yeah, I mean, the results are weird.
[01:06:33.666 - 01:06:37.532] Host: I don't know whether the word is dropping the ball, but I think it takes a lot, right?
[01:06:37.552 - 01:06:51.814] Host: When you've grown cities in the most haphazard way in which we've grown our cities and there hasn't been that kind of level of city planning to now start, as you would call it, build ring roads around it or build rings around it is not the solution.
[01:06:51.874 - 01:06:52.716] Host: It's still positive.
[01:06:52.796 - 01:06:53.797] Host: It still needs to get done.
[01:06:54.238 - 01:06:59.506] Host: So I think we're doing it in a much more tactical manner and that's a problem.
[01:06:59.650 - 01:07:07.924] Host: And I think this context sometimes when you're building in a democracy, and I think even the US faces that, which is the state versus the center, not versus sometimes.
[01:07:08.305 - 01:07:11.370] Host: There's a lot of things that depend on the state that are not what the center can do.
[01:07:11.750 - 01:07:14.856] Host: I think that creates a certain bit of friction in the ability.
[01:07:14.876 - 01:07:21.106] Host: So now today, I think chief ministers and each state actually needs to form their own national agenda because
[01:07:21.186 - 01:07:25.093] Host: There's a sense of competitiveness that's happening and a good competitiveness happening between states.
[01:07:25.153 - 01:07:28.619] Host: So how they want to really do well in the national scenario.
[01:07:28.659 - 01:07:29.561] Host: And I think that's good.
[01:07:29.681 - 01:07:32.626] Host: At least that's one semblance of benchmark that's come there.
[01:07:33.047 - 01:07:36.493] Host: But yeah, I think on infrastructure, there's a lot obviously to be done.
[01:07:37.315 - 01:07:40.140] Host: But at the same time, if you look at some of our airports, they're world class.
[01:07:40.560 - 01:07:41.522] Host: Yes.
[01:07:41.698 - 01:07:48.204] Host: Yeah, we can take more container ships than Singapore and Amsterdam, which is supposed to be the two epicenters for anything else in terms of shipping.
[01:07:48.445 - 01:07:53.430] Guest: So we're building great, large infrastructure, the highways, the ports, the airports.
[01:07:54.391 - 01:07:57.814] Host: Data centers, a refinery, if you go to Jamnagar.
[01:07:57.834 - 01:08:00.537] Host: I mean, Jamnagar is not a place where I would go and think.
[01:08:01.238 - 01:08:04.020] Host: You don't need a buggy ride to go through a refinery.
[01:08:04.040 - 01:08:04.981] Host: You have to take a car.
[01:08:05.362 - 01:08:07.143] Host: It's that level of scale.
[01:08:07.564 - 01:08:09.746] Host: So we've seen a lot of those examples also happen.
[01:08:11.874 - 01:08:24.710] Guest: Would you say also, I'm going to refrain from calling us humans because are we doing enough on the front of climate change globally?
[01:08:24.730 - 01:08:27.533] Host: That I think is a shit show.
[01:08:28.474 - 01:08:29.536] Host: It's a shit show globally.
[01:08:29.616 - 01:08:30.136] Host: I agree.
[01:08:30.156 - 01:08:34.802] Host: And I think we just got reversed because of this unpredictable leader.
[01:08:35.106 - 01:08:38.130] Host: which Hollywood movies keep calling the leader of the free world.
[01:08:38.151 - 01:08:39.833] Host: I don't know where that line comes from.
[01:08:39.913 - 01:08:41.435] Host: I feel very irritated I hear that.
[01:08:41.455 - 01:08:44.640] Host: I mean, you know, I'm part of the free world and he's not my leader.
[01:08:44.901 - 01:08:46.022] Host: So what the hell are you talking about?
[01:08:46.142 - 01:08:48.886] Host: I don't have to keep listening to Hollywood lines like that.
[01:08:48.906 - 01:08:50.729] Host: And that's where the ego gets to a certain level.
[01:08:50.789 - 01:08:52.572] Host: But yeah, it's a shit show, I think.
[01:08:52.912 - 01:08:55.236] Guest: Because now we're drilling in the Arctic Circle.
[01:08:55.356 - 01:09:02.066] Host: Yeah, that is a big toll that this nationalistic agenda of many countries will
[01:09:02.178 - 01:09:06.545] Host: could look at and do, because you're going to move to protect.
[01:09:06.565 - 01:09:08.167] Host: Then you're going to get into the tariff world.
[01:09:08.528 - 01:09:13.956] Host: Then you're going to all spend more on defense, because there are wars going on around the world.
[01:09:14.117 - 01:09:20.587] Host: And you've got the one that you fault was your ally thinking, I'm not going to be an ally unless you pay me a tariff or you pay me a fee.
[01:09:20.607 - 01:09:24.332] Host: So the whole trading context has made defense budgets go through the roof.
[01:09:24.352 - 01:09:27.177] Host: So defense is taking precedence over climate change.
[01:09:28.138 - 01:09:30.482] Host: And you can't argue with people, because
[01:09:30.562 - 01:09:35.950] Host: everyone's feeling insecure versus whether I'll be able to breathe better or will I be alive kind of context.
[01:09:35.990 - 01:09:38.593] Host: So everything is a little bit more life threatening than what it was.
[01:09:39.234 - 01:09:42.639] Host: So I don't have any answers, but other than to say it is a shit show.
[01:09:44.181 - 01:09:45.082] Guest: That's disappointing.
[01:09:46.424 - 01:09:56.338] Guest: But in India, I know that over the last decade or more, there's been a lot of intent from government
[01:09:56.482 - 01:09:59.908] Guest: pushing us towards looking more at sustainability at climate change.
[01:09:59.928 - 01:10:01.270] Guest: Are we doing enough in your opinion?
[01:10:01.330 - 01:10:02.813] Host: No, but it's not that easy, right?
[01:10:02.853 - 01:10:13.370] Host: Because you have 600 people in rural India and when you light that wood stove or when you burn a little bit of that forest fire or whatever else you do, because that's your habitat, right?
[01:10:13.410 - 01:10:14.131] Host: And we've done that.
[01:10:14.171 - 01:10:18.118] Host: We're talking to people and saying we're going to give you stoves because we just want to improve the air pollution.
[01:10:18.559 - 01:10:20.562] Host: It's your small little bit, but it's not.
[01:10:20.962 - 01:10:30.997] Host: and how we dispose off with garbage in the entire country, and what we do there between burn versus this versus the ocean, those are big, big, big problems to solve there.
[01:10:31.057 - 01:10:33.841] Host: So whatever you do is not even a drop in the ocean.
[01:10:34.081 - 01:10:43.675] Host: These ones is where I think, I mean, look, we're sitting here in this room, Mumbai yesterday, great, you could see all the ships in the oceans, way far away.
[01:10:43.875 - 01:10:45.778] Host: This morning, you could see a damn thing.
[01:10:45.922 - 01:10:46.683] Host: Overnight.
[01:10:47.304 - 01:10:55.355] Guest: So I do get the sense, though, that by the time we're done with all of this and we look up, the climate change deadlines would have slipped past us.
[01:10:56.276 - 01:11:02.985] Guest: And we will have no answer to offer the next couple of generations on how we messed this up.
[01:11:03.425 - 01:11:05.388] Host: Yeah, and the monsoons are not going away in India.
[01:11:05.568 - 01:11:07.110] Host: They're still raining in November.
[01:11:07.791 - 01:11:11.056] Host: And the coastal cities, I think, will have a problem.
[01:11:11.416 - 01:11:15.762] Host: And maybe 20 years from now, Venice will be underwater.
[01:11:16.418 - 01:11:19.144] Host: and one can talk a lot of those situations there.
[01:11:19.705 - 01:11:21.048] Host: But it's not just that also.
[01:11:21.188 - 01:11:30.648] Host: It's actually where, you know, we're talking about it from an air point of view, but if you sit down with our farmers, they want it from a very different point of view because they don't know what to do with their crops, right?
[01:11:30.708 - 01:11:35.318] Host: I mean, otherwise you used to have those droughts and you had famines, but now it's not even that.
[01:11:35.418 - 01:11:36.641] Host: It's like it's unpredictable.
[01:11:36.681 - 01:11:37.202] Host: How do I
[01:11:37.346 - 01:11:45.429] Host: plant crops that need light weather, but it's going to pour cats and dogs for the next 14 days, or I'm not getting sunshine, but I need to do that.
[01:11:45.830 - 01:11:52.850] Host: So if you look at a country like India, the biggest challenge outside of air pollution is we are an agri-based country quite a lot.
[01:11:52.962 - 01:11:55.105] Host: And for our farmers, that's a big problem.
[01:11:55.145 - 01:11:56.246] Host: Big problem, the weather.
[01:11:56.266 - 01:12:00.171] Guest: Like in Maharashtra, this year, they've just not had a brick from the rain to sow.
[01:12:00.191 - 01:12:06.019] Host: So if we look at farming industry, the fishing industry, and here we're talking about whether we can breathe a little bit of air.
[01:12:06.079 - 01:12:07.401] Host: Am I jogging this morning?
[01:12:07.421 - 01:12:07.861] Host: Yeah, sure.
[01:12:07.901 - 01:12:08.923] Host: It's definitely a problem.
[01:12:09.544 - 01:12:14.450] Host: But this is our countrymen, the fishermen.
[01:12:14.722 - 01:12:16.565] Host: It's a big industry in India.
[01:12:16.685 - 01:12:18.528] Host: A lot of people, that's one of the best.
[01:12:18.928 - 01:12:23.335] Host: Agriculture and fisheries are one of the largest self-employment opportunities, right?
[01:12:23.636 - 01:12:25.038] Host: More than anything else that you're doing here.
[01:12:25.058 - 01:12:26.440] Host: We keep talking about skilling, whatever else.
[01:12:26.901 - 01:12:30.186] Host: Now, if those get displaced, huge problem.
[01:12:30.206 - 01:12:35.534] Guest: If you had to write down a raw ambition for India as a unit, what would that be?
[01:12:36.215 - 01:12:39.339] Guest: Three things that you think that we should sort of tackle?
[01:12:40.321 - 01:12:43.666] Host: You need an incredible amount of discipline, you know,
[01:12:43.746 - 01:12:48.735] Host: And discipline is not about just waking up in the morning or losing weight or expiring.
[01:12:48.755 - 01:12:54.446] Host: It's just that mental discipline that I think we need to do, which I think is very, very important.
[01:12:54.987 - 01:13:00.737] Host: I think for me, frugality, lack of entitlement and discipline form raw ambition.
[01:13:00.978 - 01:13:01.679] Guest: From raw ambition.
[01:13:02.400 - 01:13:04.103] Guest: Rani, thank you so much for speaking with me today.
[01:13:04.123 - 01:13:04.324] Guest: Thank you.
[01:13:04.364 - 01:13:04.744] Guest: Thank you.
[01:13:04.825 - 01:13:05.586] Guest: It's been a pleasure.
