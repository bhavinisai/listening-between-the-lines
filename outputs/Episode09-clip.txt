old gave up everything to pursue my nineteen year old dream my nineteen year old opportunity is that even when someone sees your life the way you speak about it there's a lot of blessings at like a lot of points you believe in karma absolutely you believe in reincarnation i do do you think about what you did in your previous life to get this life now i hope so i do and i always think about it like if you think why do i have why am i lucky enough to have the life that i do and some other woman somewhere else with the same opportunity with the same desires same ambitions same you know needs doesn't have any of it i really think about that a lot it makes me feel like there must be something i did right i wake up every day with a sense of gratitude and i wake up every day with wanting to give back whether that's with the person that is standing right next to me or whether that is a a life choice that i might make but giving back i think is so crucial when it comes to being grateful i'm highly grateful for everything that i have and i do think that maybe i did something right that i've been blessed with the opportunity of having the life being born to the parents that i was being able to have the opportunity of making my own choices having agency in my own life if you think about women around the world so many don't have that the complete choices are made for themselves but my parents told me you have to have your opinion what a privilege yeah that's that's a part of the blessing being born to those parents i mean that's the biggest one probably yeah completely wow okay hold on i gotta i gotta take my thoughts and just put them together i made you speechless no no okay with this whole journey mhmm and this is a question that's been sent in from a lot of people who i spoke to before this chat mhmm i've firstly i wanted wanna tell you that you inspire men women everyone
