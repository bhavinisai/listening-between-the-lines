we look at western cultures we look at western world and the start of which i worked there right and we try to copy that here that's terrible you know from the maybe hundred unicorns today i don't think the out of these hundred more than twenty five will be unicorns in the next two to three years we should really be cautious that they should not become the inspiration for all your listeners and viewers here also today because actually that's a bad example to follow but this gold standard that we put on this self acclaimed back thumping chest thumping approach because five people backed you at a certain valuation and you manage that your problems are all starting now don't you feel that some people should not be an entrepreneur and they're trying to become entrepreneurs today's episode is with the india media mogul and the education mogul as well at the same time today we spoke to ronnie screwvala who started his journey from the scratch on the streets in mumbai and turned around his life into something really really big he started with building a media house then he bought a kabaddi team and turned that around then he started an edtech company called upgrad and now he is actually helping every indian learn better and get upgraded with their skills so that they can lead better in their life in today's episode we've spoken about the media education sector entrepreneurship what young entrepreneurs make mistake what is the difference between venture funded startups and bootstrap starters and so many more tips which you and i everybody will be benefited from and and and if you feel that this podcast is really long then go subscribe our rachamani clips and rachamani shorts channel to enjoy this into small clips and learn better in just short amount of time enjoy us today's show tell me like were you always like this big dreamer and dream with your feet on the ground or like you started as i think i started with feet on the ground then i started dreaming i don't think i started with dreaming you were you're not born into riches you're not what's your background like give me yeah i mean yeah complete lower middle class background in a place in mumbai called grant road i do remember we had a large joint family there was no private bedroom the toilet was at the end of the door and i spent my first seventeen years incredible grounding in those days the you know the there was a lovely cafe seven eight six on the ground floor which served the best biryani in grant road and the best jalebis okay my two aunts and my mom used to teach the piano so i think all my first few girlfriends were all students piano students that'll come there for whoever did you did you learn to impress them yes i i learned how to play the piano in the process but that is compliments to my mom and my aunts not not the not the girlfriends but very very fond memories and that's why i meant that you get grounded you know then your expectation on life is everything is up there and i think many of the times when i've been set back my introspection was now how worse can it get at worst look at the first seventeen years of my life i was very happy then so even if i get back to even that level how bad can it get it allows you and empowers you to take lots of risks and lower your expectations in life interesting okay tell tell me one interesting lesson that you learned while you were going through that phase or like from i i wouldn't i don't want to call that adversity but like in the initial years of your life like something that you learned and that still stays with you was that i think i well i mean i'm coining it now i don't think it was i was not mature enough to do then you know where i learned a couple of things one is you're on your own i mean you're on your own in many ways i mean not from a family family ecosystem is always there but you're on your own and the second one is when you choose to do something you have to go about it with you don't have a choice right because i think when i told my parents that i want to do something on my own that was a big shock for them like it is for most ninety nine percent of the parents that want to look at that but they were like good parsi parents quietly worrisomely supportive okay and i think one of the things that my parents said is look even if you finally want to do this i just want to tell you you're on your own because we don't have the money for your first mistake forget about your second mistake and your third mistake and i think that rung a bell with me that says you know you're on your own and therefore you don't have a choice and when you have these two non parachutes non parachutes with you in life it kind of holds you very tightly and makes again your feet on the ground always mhmm yeah that's a that's a very interesting take because you are on your own and mostly what you do yeah but i'll tell you a contradictory thing like with i also grew up in like a middle class family and didn't have enough money for the mistakes and stuff but my parents on the contradictory maybe because now the generation has changed and so much awareness is there they have always been there okay we know that we don't have enough resources but even if you fail don't worry correct like they were so i think is is all parents like i mean all parents would be i think what they were telling me in a very materialistic sense is while our spirit will be willing our wallet will be heavenly enough you know they they always say i'm asking this question because people say this right that the money changes you success changes you the more you achieve you kind of become like a different person so that's why like the belief system and the things that you value do that change or not i've seen that happen with people and i'm not sitting here from the pulpit and trying to lecture i i i hope but i have my own report card that it doesn't reflect for me that money has changed anything for me but i can see that it is quite intoxicating right because it's a thumbs up for you what is it it you know when you see that what do you do money attracts people thumping your back it attracts more friends than you want it attracts a fan club which can be which can be disappeared the next day it makes every glory look a non fleeting whereas it should be fleeting so it can go to people's head and it just sounds like you're an invulnerable and actually you are a vulnerable at any given stage and the world is fragile it is fragile today in many many ways right i mean what do you mean by the fragile world i mean it's an it not just changes it is a fragile world today i think the biggest challenge for any person young or old aren't wanting to do something on their own or in a job in a career or not in a profession as a lawyer or a doctor or whatever else has to deal with fragility because it comes there's so many things that are actually changing in around you and fifty percent of them are not in your control right i mean i'm not talking about the macro things of a war in ukraine and two banks collapsing or the economy those are all i think we have lived that that's going to be a way of life but fragility today i think you know what troubles me frankly is the fact that almost ten percent fifteen percent of the people today are have more of a mental crisis i mean we're now vocally talking about the context of mental health right versus health most people would have scorned on that yeah firstly i'm gonna treat somebody who's genuinely sick you think i'm gonna wait for you because your mind is not working how dare your mind is not working go fix it but today that's real yeah so which means there's a so much of fragility in the world that's creating so much conflict in your mind and there's so much information that comes your way you know and i think my brother-in-law told me one fine day last week he says i'm going to put that watch on you because i'm going to give you a lot of data you can do that when you're ex i said look i'm dealing with too many data points i don't want more data right now now in my life and i don't mean data in that sense just any more information to process because frankly you need to you need to chill you need to relax you need to get the thoughts let come flow into your mind so to me fragility is things outside your control will change things within you will control and change they will change more sharply than ever before if something was bad news you'll have time to process it maybe even avert it go back and do it i think that's becoming less and less before you can digest it it could be fatal you know i am asking this to you because i recently read about like couple of silicon valley founders who have all made it multi million dollars in last four to five years like from zero to four five years and then there was a study done on there there's eighty of them they found out majority of them are data control freaks sure and they track their life their time their body not only their organization and their productivity they track themselves yeah in fact so i was having a conversation with someone about this and they said like they track the the steps they do the food they eat the calories they intake like every little thing about everything like they just track everything do you think that kind of tracking becomes no and i can tell you is it good or bad like this is no right there's no judgment call it's each one to their own so i would not say i would not say no i think that's relevant but for each time so i will answer that question by saying if there are eighty of them a b in silicon valley c done multimillion and if they've done it between two thousand and nineteen and two thousand and twenty two that's a different era mhmm will they be able to do it if it started in two thousand twenty to two thousand twenty five probably not and that's the difference between saying i'm a data freak and therefore i mean because there were things that are not being controlled whatever velocity they thought that got them there fifty percent is serendipity and tailwind of some sorts that that gets you to a certain level number one two the opportunities in each place are also very very different right and you can do that for a momentary time in four five years the question would be can we track the same eighty people over the next seven years and figure out whether how many of them kept their wealth if wealth is the benchmark because that the other unfortunate part is your benchmark of all of this is wealth yeah why where's the happiness quotient where's the joy quotient where's the balance quotient where's there so many other quotient and i'm not talking about nirvana i'm not talking about buddhism i'm not talking about vipassana i'm not talking about meditation just the because at at some stage when you have this kind of acuteness you're gonna need balance at some stage because do you really wanna test the pulse on your body and the calories that you burn every single day of your life you know because at some stage the penny is gonna drop did that make me happy that i was so you know will power is a very difficult thing for a lot of people and it's great the people who have will power and i think at leadership you need that kind of will power right because you need that will power to get up at four thirty in the morning and still continue a regimen routine ninety nine percent of the people who say i travel ten days of the month i can't keep my can't keep myself fit but the people who have a will power will find themselves so that's a very strong anchor but i would say to this you there are two three things here one is validate that after five years and see how many people continue to do that second wealth is not the only benchmark and third is if you're so obsessed i think you need to take a reality check can you be obsessed with twenty years at a go i don't think so does that make sense that makes sense because it's periodically relevant for some people at some stage as much as a sprint versus a marathon yeah as much as a hundred meters versus five hundred meters and whatever else yeah and you know we we overestimate when we achieve something we tend to look back and try to connect dots and overestimate like you know we we give more importance to certain things because we are going through that phase it well not only do we give more importance i think we give more credit to ourselves than let you that's true ninety nine percent so i was i just said it yesterday this is a belief there's no math behind it and there's no science i just believe that ninety nine percent of his serendipity like luck one percent is your manufactured luck right yeah yeah and by manufactured luck i mean it's like something worse strong believer in serendipity i wouldn't put ninety nine percent or ninety percent i put it at fifty percent okay because if it's ninety nine percent or ninety percent also then you are you might as well sit down and chill and let the breeze blow but it may blow you in different directions but if you really want to catch serendipity then you need to be out there in multiple places so that when the wind catches you you know when to ride on the sail and when to walk in the trenches fair i know that's what i was saying there's no math to it i just believe that it's a combination of manufactured long and but it needs to have a slightly more balanced than saying i'm around now come hit me from the back true that makes sense okay quick question what do you think like what makes what's the difference between successful entrepreneurs and versus people who kind of quit on just the entrepreneurship journey after a while i would not call them unsuccessful entrepreneurs well i can like people who make it was as if we would don't make it and the judgment criteria can be wealth happiness impact anything i'm just saying like people who make it is not made yeah i would answer this very directly because i think the question is a very relevant and important one the people who haven't made it there is no category like that because actually that's not a category so it's not that i'm comparing it to do but but the difference between somebody who made it and somebody who called it a day because there's no such thing as i didn't make it yeah it only means you called it a day and therefore the difference between the two is you didn't stick it out you didn't stick it out because if you stuck it out you wouldn't be in this category that you have self it's a self claim category it's not a category that is a category i didn't make it there is no such category i didn't stick it out that's a category i copped out that's a category there's no question about the fact it may not be the success you planned it to be but the fact is that the people who got it because they eventually became successful okay so if you ask me which of my journey whatever else is because it's that's the journey and you're eventually and then eventually becomes a new benchmark and okay there's a certain benchmark for which you feel you may not fall but you could so that is a progressive one but the people who did not make it opened a category that doesn't exist but it's a self made category called i didn't make it because i don't think anyone should sit in that category and say i didn't make it why why of course you may have failed you may have got bankrupt shit would have happened to you lots of things may have happened it meant at that particular point your life is over your career is over your reputation maybe i don't mean reputation as in you did something in it you know it was crooked so without ethics your reputation of a failure those are those will fly out of the window in one minute so i think that category should be nixed but i don't do do you feel like there are people who are not cut out for certain things and they should not try that like do you think like equity so they're not cut out for for like just asking you a question like do you feel that some people should not be an entrepreneur and they're trying to become entrepreneurs or some people should not be what so then it's not that they didn't make it they tried something and they made the wise decision that i need to go back into a cry into my into a zone which i know is gonna be my security zone like i think taking risks or working and taking that responsibility is not my best i perform better when i'm part of a overall support system that doesn't mean you didn't make it as an entrepreneur you did that and then you took a good call that says for good reason not because i failed not because i didn't make it so and i'm trying to dissect this here because i think i've lived all of those journeys enough to be able to dissect that and say very clearly don't go do it because if you think i'm gonna i have the option to go back to a job you will mhmm if you start on your journey and i think you asked me in the very beginning whatever one or two things that i started from my early childhood and i said one is you know you're on your own and the second is you don't have a choice so if you ask me today given that i had zero opening bank balance and didn't have money like everybody else thinks today is their birthright that i won't start a business unless somebody funds me today at that stage there was no such thing it was the reverse of that so for the next ten years not having any fiscal support but still building something you go with the fact that i don't have a choice you have worn multiple hats okay there's a media company and then there's edtech and then there's multiple things there's a sports franchise right like everything you've done and you have you have tasted success in like multiple of them after lots of failures but of course we will come to failures i'll come to that but i want to understand like you know there are people who are really good at one thing but when they try to get out of their zone of like level of expertise they kind of fail in like other things right so what do you think like what what makes somebody or what are the fundamentals what is that one thing or two things which makes someone successful in like multiple things yeah because it's difficult to succeed in like somebody domain expertise and figuring that out i mean the first is the supposition that i was a media expert when i decided to start media i wasn't right i mean again that was serendipity okay that got me there the day in which i said i want to start something was not the day i knew i wanted to start start something in media at the time in which i started it there was no words and vocabulary like media and entertainment but now the world describes you like media expert and all of that like it's at that stage it wasn't the case right but i used to do a lot of weekend as a hobby weekend theater i used to do front of camera hosting for dudarshan at that particular point in time so why and how those are all desperate to get pocket money and theater was something i came not having from a lower middle class house not having too much of education so soft skills for me were very important and theater debate elocution helped me there so i think those were the early years where i felt wow i'm having fun and i'm earning pocket money to go out on a date i mean that was real pocket money it was like two hundred and fifty rupees on a weekend or five hundred rupees on a weekend kind of situation but enough for you to be able to move up in your lifestyle and not go home and ask your parents for even fifty bucks at that particular point in time so it was great fun and i so my first part of my career was not because i was i had an inkling towards media and entertainment but because i was exposed to it and then i said why don't i make a business of it so i think that's that's kinda how it works i mean i think if i went forward to so i think domain expertise when you're in a job or you know when you've taken engineering or technology that's a good one but that doesn't mean today you need to be a specialist only you can be a generalist mhmm so all i'm saying is people can do something great for the entire part of their career i'm sure if you're a great lawyer the probability of you switching and saying i wanna be a doctor for the rest of my life is not gonna is not gonna work so there'll always be those examples right but a leader in a oil rig company can become a ceo of a media company why because both are equal in terms of their probabilities of success you'll drill hundred times and at three times when the oil will hit the ground right i'm just saying it as a yeah so it's about how you how you build the organization how you look at your if you understand consumer if you understand consumers you understand trends you can actually transcend many many sectors okay we'll come to consumer trends because that's my favorite favorite favorite area but speaking on the topic you said about taking risk on entrepreneurship right in as an entrepreneur or as a job as an employer as anyone you need to take risk in order to go ahead there was a very interesting quote which i heard it says getting rich is about taking a lots of risk with small amount of money and staying rich is a lot about taking small risk with a lots of money and to me that was like super interesting but when you think about it what essentially the court is trying to say is take calculated risk at any point of your life right and you believe in that like every entrepreneur should keep taking risk and but what's the right way to take a calculated risk yeah so firstly i mean risk is a very subjective word right because it really the most important part of a risk is your own appetite your own appetite not just financially your own appetite mentally a lot of people think you know because can you have the shock absorbers to take whatever because if you're resilient it doesn't make a difference where the financials will come from that'll get could get figured out in most spaces if you have the mental aptitude for it for risk it will work very differently to the court that you just mentioned i think my ratio of success to failure is about eight failures to two successes so let me explain my formula if not my quote because i do believe that in and this is evolved over a period of time it's not a strategy that i walked into but at the stage where i walked in with a dna that says what have i got to lose in a snakes and ladders game i'm still in the game even if i go from ninety seven down to six because it's still six it's not zero okay so what's my worst case i'll go down to six but i'm still in the game and i don't know i might still go up there because there's there's ladders to climb and snakes to slip down from so i think my ratio is that when i take the risks the outcome or the failure is a one x it could be i invested ten crores and it was a write off or i hired somebody and it was a write off or i started a business and it's a write off but whatever that is it's a finite zero sums game but when you're taking those kind of risks on a sustained basis and i don't mean risk just for the sake of taking risk but if you got these opportunities the probability of you having a forty x fifty x or sixty x gain versus the three x or a four x gain in the things that really work you're setting yourself up for that and that's what worked for me as a formula that while there are enough of the minus one x's but if two of them are thirty x that's sixty and sixty minus eight is fifty two now that that could be thirty two but it still won't be two yeah and i think now it's not just a mathematical equation and it's not about only money it could be as i said one could be a decision about personal one could be a decision about people one could be a decision about exiting something before it's time giving up on something before it's time all of those are one x's but because you're moving your journey along with that that in mind your probability of high success versus good success is really where wealth creation happens okay you talked about consumer trends alright and i wanna know that because you said like you can actually win at a lot of things in the business world in different arenas as well if you know how to spot consumer trends so give me like what do you feel what's the trend in india right now sure firstly to spot it you need to be in it right you need to be in the you need to walk the talk you need to be doing that you need to be open to the fact most people are not necessarily open to the fact they'll take a consumer research or they take a focus group they wanna do it because it's a tick in their book but actually they're saying yeah yeah yeah i think what he wanted to say was this and what no no no he's saying three different things from what you set out to do in that context so i think you need to be kind of open to that the second part i think is especially my media days and today even in in in upgrad and what we're doing in in skilling basically my next fifteen years is about preempting careers of tomorrow it's about seeing how soft skills can become super skills for people making them understand that just a formal degree is fantastic but it's not the be all and end all and that every single day every three years the good news is and the bad news is that when you throw up your graduation cap and you thought you were done you're not done anymore so when you're looking at that and you're preempting it you need to understand what's in people's mind right because i may say here's a career of tomorrow but the fact of the matter is that that person may not feel the agility for it and how do you get them and therefore understanding what the consumer what's my messaging to them to pinch them to make them feel that hey hey you need to upgrade and one of the examples and we have a great university here as part of upgrad which is at bkc and we had a class of about thirty five forty of them that were in a room and i came in there and i brought the head of kpmg and the head of mckinsey there and they were talking about careers of tomorrow like here's you know i mean as normal consultants everyone talks about here's what i think is gonna be there and the kids there said wait wait wait wait wait actually we are here to tell you what the careers of tomorrow are we don't want to hear from you what you think they are because actually we're going to make the careers of tomorrow it doesn't make a difference whether you think this is what it is and this is the future we know what we want to do for the next thirty years of our life and that's going to be the careers of tomorrow and when you take that insight that one insight i'm sure those two people walked away from there saying i better shred half my reports out there because if i don't if i'm telling people what they need to be prepared for without listening to what they think they want to do for the next thirty years which is gonna give them maximum joy excitement to do i'm missing the boat so that's my best example i can give you of why it is absolutely important how you do it and you need to and i think for me the beccs mix today is i'm involved with storytelling by making movies so you have to understand what audiences are looking for just in every sense of the word why they want to go to the cinema what do they want to tell in stories what's the genre what's this and then in education what they want to do with their careers and work life balance and if you put all of that together and if i do a a webinar with five thousand of our alumni on a sunday i get more insights with the questions they ask than having five boardroom or meeting room conversations there so it just depends on how you're open how you process that information and we know we spoke a little bit about data earlier on but data without understanding how you're going to place it in context is very very important a little bit like i had this conversation and you know it was so much gold there but no it may be gold to them how am i gonna make it platinum or gold or silver is up to me okay you is that too fun now it's too much i yeah i figured that so i can break it down exactly i'll break it down into three different parts okay so these are three different lives you're talking about and three different things one is the media and the stories part i'll come to that the other was a work life balance that is a different part and third was how do you take people's feedback and then kind of backward engineer and try to build the kind of skills between but i do wanna say that all are three amalgamate because if i want to figure out the consumer of tomorrow what is their wallet share why you are spending only twenty percent on entertainment three years back and now you wanna make it forty percent or why you're spending three percent on education and why you're spending twenty percent now all of this you'll need all this information but we can still break it up but i'm saying understanding the consumer to understand because you asked me the first question on this was what do you think where do you think consumers are at and what are they looking for so therefore a lot of that is what is their wallet share like if you had a hundred bucks what would you spend it on if the if the if the if if my if my community in the village where we work for example if he had a hundred bucks or she had a hundred bucks what would she work what would the mother do what would the daughter do what would the son who migrated to mumbai from laika do all of these are very different questions for different people oof okay and alright we'll we'll come to this okay interesting take on wallet share because and give me your take on this okay i read a report recently it was done by like obviously consultants and stuff like very named i don't wanna quote them because it might change so fifty four percent what they said that our parents' generation used to save fifty four percent of their income yep okay and our generation only spent only saved seventeen percent of their income yep so that that's a huge difference like there are like thirty thirty five percent which people are spending now more than saving yep so where do do you like you have read the wallet share and you understand that much better where do you feel like the consumers of today or the today's generation is spending on so the mindset has changed right i mean the fact of the matter is when you ask your parents and they've got a bank balance you say mom dad why don't you go to nainital and have a holiday you know what will happen to me so they're thinking of that negative tomorrow they're thinking of the positive tomorrow you're thinking tomorrow today i have to live so that mindset has changed a lot and that is a that's not wallet share that's behavior pattern that's spending pattern that's everything you want to do and a lot of that is because of the media the social media the interactiveness and the peer to peer pressure that you get today that they didn't have so that to me is the is the one where somebody is looking that tomorrow i need to make provide for tomorrow mhmm and you're saying yeah that's true i'm little i'm still in the middle of it i am sometimes i'm gonna know sometimes i'm gonna say twenty five percent is still spending by the way i wanna tell you that slightly better than some nations where that fifty percent is all debt yeah consumer credit yeah but that's what i'm saying so you take here this is the psyche and actually it's a good indian psyche from that point of view but if you take a western country you take america their pocket share is not hundred bucks it's for hundred bucks their pocket share is three thousand bucks for hundred bucks because you can mortgage your flat you can do this you can take on debt everything is on that basis right so then your your leveraging is very different and you're leveraging at zero point two five percent interest where in india we've grown up on eight to twelve point five percent interest for example then everyone's mindset your parents' mindset to whatever else is there's a value for money mhmm but and that doesn't mean i'm saying america is a less value for money but it's just a very different way so wallet share in each country when you're looking at a consumer you'll have to see which consumer the guy in vietnam the person in india the person in bangladesh the person in us the person in ukraine very different you know what and you know we tend to yaron i'm having so many different questions and i'm not completing the last one but i'm still gonna ask so what do you feel like what everybody we look at western cultures we look at western world and the start of which i worked there right and we try to copy that here that's terrible right but i've never done that in my life and i don't know why people do that but i wanna just caution you what you read about in the media is that small minority of people that actually look at that but if you see the people that are out there and some of the entrepreneurs the sme sector the small and middle scale those are making manufacturing if somebody's working in climate change they're working in agriculture they're working those are all those are all non copy paste so they're homegrown they're home but ninety percent of business ideas today on accumulated basis not basis on how they're funded by nine crazy vc and private equity investors who want to just throw money on people the other people they're when you don't have that kind of money you come up with better business models some few investors have decided to overvalue you i mean anything nothing can go to that level no mercury rises in such a sudden manner so i think that was a phase there was a phase of zero cost of capital there was a phase in that that report card changes very very quickly i don't think we should use that as the gold standard or is that as the benchmark for anything from that point of view i mean i've said it before and i'll say it again you know from the maybe a hundred unicorns today i don't think the out of these hundred more than twenty five will be unicorns in the next two to three years there might be another x number of unicorns i'm sure we'll have many many who'll have the right value but they'll have built a much more business but today i think a lot of fragility in the in in the valuations that have happened there and for all good reason we know that we know the reason why it's happened so we should not we should really be cautious that they should not become the inspiration for all your listeners and viewers here also today because actually that's a bad example to follow and look i mean i think abgrad is in that category but i i kind of cringe because i'm just saying we went about what we went about the first five years we funded it ourselves and then we went through with that process but this gold standard that we put on this self acclaimed back thumping chest thumping approach because five people backed you at a certain valuation and you manage that your problems are all starting now mhmm there's a statutory warning your problems start now after getting that status at your because now where do you go now where do you go where do you go from here now you've got to build solid where do you go from here now you know what sales is worth twenty five sure out of the hundred yeah i would say the rest where do you go from here yeah for the and if that's not a model then let's keep that out and then when we talk about the real india or the real opportunities even the real anywhere from that point of view or the real vietnam or the real china or the real any economy or the real africa i mean you know there's a lot happening true that that is i'll come to that india story right and first i want to complete the last question with where do you feel like the today's customer is spending on like what do you think where are we spending the most the year generation is it entertainment is it education like where are we spending the most yeah so i mean my broad and i'm not an economist so i'm not giving i'm giving i'm i'm giving a very down to earth person to person as as a customer and i i can see that the self consumption has gone up and i say self consumption then they can have many roots in that so for some people i think the whole element of what i would call for yourself is a combination of entertainment recreation outdoor activities something that you want to consume in that thought process lifestyle approach what you spend so there's a whole consumption pattern on self whether it could be an expensive phone because it's you're spending six hours a day or three hours a day on it to lifestyle to how you want to dress and do whatever else to what you want to consume in every sense of the word and recreation i think today more and more people have spent more money on that the savings part i think is the one that has shrunk because you do believe rightly so i think and in india that tomorrow is gonna be better than yesterday and i think when you ask for that generation maybe your parents at that stage grew up where tomorrow may not be as good as yesterday yeah and then you have a very cautious approach to life so it's not that they were born pessimists but it's just that you felt i have to save for a rainy day today i don't think that's the first thing you think of a rainy day you know part of it is also because you have a lot of self confidence today in in in young india like i'll manage i'll figure it out at that time you didn't feel you had to figure it out that's why my dad said and tell me but you are on your own yeah because he didn't think that there would be but at that stage in age i felt i'll figure it out true so that's why my ability to take risks so my spending part of a hundred b wallet will be on great ideas it may not be necessarily on my self consumption the t shirts and the trousers i wear i buy ten of each and then wear them for ten years okay so it's the easiest decision for shopping and it's the easiest decision every morning for wearing your clothes right so i think it's each one to their own but still it's self consumption it is self consumption it is self consumption but it is because you believe tomorrow is yes better than is going to be better than today and i think some of the other earlier and you know i'm i'm i'm not saying i'm in the i'm in the generation where i feel young but i'm in a in a older generation so i i feel i can relate to both where i do believe tomorrow is better than yesterday and i think and spend accordingly yeah because i've you know you you're right because i've seen my father from like the best thing happened to me was like i saw my father group building okay i was born at the time when we were not doing very well financially and then eventually i saw that whole struggle like up and down up and down and then eventually started doing better right but even today his entire life is about right his whole life i've never heard him saying okay let me go take a take a holiday yeah let me go spend on myself let me buy something because i like it yeah and whereas we i make like fresh shit about my dad is made when it's not in the not from an indulgent or lack of indulgence point of view he might think it's worth it to take all of you all for a holiday yeah yeah okay but now you're not willing to go for a holiday then his mind will change overnight on that yeah that's true okay and coming to the next topic okay that was about education mhmm and because i have my own courses as well i have my small university called figuring out university where we teach people a lot of how to become content creators how do you expand your businesses through social media and stuff like that right and that's something i came to a realization because i used to talk about public speaking as well and i i used to have courses on public speaking and stuff right and correct me if i'm wrong india specifically this is what the pattern i've seen india spends very high when there's a promise of jobs of jobs yeah well of jobs or the money or something in return like there's a promise of certificate which can get them a better job right they spend very less on soft skills yeah right they and then they spend like extremely low on something which is just for passion yeah so the highest is something which is rewarding them instantly yeah second is passion and third is something which is just like passion meaning your second second is soft skill and third is passion yeah so do you feel that that's true i think that's a very good categorization but bottom line is it's not about whether see firstly education is a very evolved word because education is a calendar event now in your life which is school and college so the minute you say education sounds like i'm going back to a place to learn and i think today people are understanding that education is a lot more it's a lifelong learning process or a learning process or a skilling process or an upgrading process there you're right that for a lot of people see in a developing country or even even though we're gonna be one of the three largest economies we're still in many ways developing even though we're not a category for developing country in india but in that category you are looking at where ninety percent of the people do want some sense of instant gratification there's low roi on soft skills because it's not an immediate yeah you know in the heart of heart that yeah if i could just do this this actually i just finished interviewing for a job but if i'm i don't think the connection is that if i knew my soft skills i would be able to get eighty percent better marks just because i presented myself better rather than i knew everything i needed to do to go into that interview so today it's a lack of knowledge that you feel because soft skills is the most i'm a product of soft skills yeah i'm not a product of half skills i did my bcom and then i moved on to being an entrepreneur so everything that i've done since that not having had funding for ten years not having had recourse is about my own self confidence then my ability to communicate and i wasn't born with that right i mean it was something that i inculcated i realized the power of soft skills more than anything else and therefore i'm a preacher of that i'm an evangelist and my second book i did was really about saying how important soft skills is and i think for a lot of people they don't see the immediate roi they feel but actually that is going to be ten times more critical today in this field of education and i think what you're doing here around this show people want to absorb that today they want to feel okay so i need that two three things they might listen to us for forty five minutes they just need to get two points out of it nobody needs to get forty points out of it we've talked about an array of things that i know you might say we've talked about lots of things in this too much but actually what i want to do is if two people if one person has two things to take away from it superb true now that in that context what they take will be something that will give them that level of clarity and confidence to put into life so i think soft skills is underrated but it's very very very critical i started calling it super skills because soft sounds soft yeah but super sounds like shakti man nice i like that so i think we should all because we're gonna be a super power and i think we should just call it super skills because actually it's going to give you super powers and you're going to be a super hero if you can just get your soft skills into some super skills and look there are sixty soft skills you just need to know two pick your two not everything is about you being able to be a great person or an articulation or english language hindi language tamil i think it's about any two things that you think will make you stand out is what you need to pick and then just focus on them just curious question from an entrepreneur point what's the difference between upgrad versus all the other tech companies no yeah so i mean the way i see it is our vision is a much more integrated approach right i mean i'm saying somebody may just want to give college degrees somebody wants to do a bootcamp somebody wants to do just job enable i think what we have and this is my media upbringing and the way i've started a media company i'm a firm believer that scale in a country like india or in a when you want to build a global company which i think we want to do is to have something integrated which means you take everyone plus called k-twelve which is a college learner all the way till sixty five and look at all their needs and i think that's a differentiator today where some people are doing study abroad some people are doing transnational education some people are doing only boot camps some people are doing formal degrees some people are doing undergrad degrees some people have only offline and online blended i think our ability is to do all and i think reflecting back when i started off and finally made a media business and i think the reason we stood out and created value was because we were not just a content creator we were not just a production house but we had ten broadcast channels yet we understood content and created for many people yet we were a movie studio we were an animation studio in a production house so it was all very much part of media it wasn't some diversified salt to steal kind of definition it was a very connected approach to creativity and and being a catalyst but in an area where when something went down something would go up and i think that makes you know more like an aircraft carrier so i see ourselves more as a flotilla or as a sort of an armada of ships rather than just having one one aircraft carrier because sometimes once that hit then it's it and where do you which one is your favorite or where do you see the most traction out of all the things that you provide so at upgrad i'm fascinated by the fact that i think the future of learning tomorrow is going to be a lot more about peer to peer learning and i know that most people said when you build brick and mortar curriculum is important follow the rules important and faculty is important and faculty is definitely important but we're not gonna be able to solve the faculty problem in india because it isn't but peer to peer learning today is becoming today as it's like anything else right when you wanna consume you don't wanna see a marketing ad anymore you wanna see what forty other people who experienced it went through that yeah so that whole element of study groups and peer to peer learning is something that we're cannibalizing and second i think that the umbrella of the future of learning is coaching and mentoring and i don't mean one on one coaching or even what we're doing here it's just the element of permanent coaching and mentoring if i look at these two umbrellas i think that's our guiding force for everything that we're building for the next ten years what do you feel like how is what do you understand about indian consumers like give us some consumer insight that you feel like oh indians are different in this way if i'm an entrepreneur is there something i should know about india very well or something that you've noticed diversity diversity of culture diversity of needs diversity of spending and i think you can look at that in the largest common denominator you're gonna look at it in the top of the pinnacle there's so many different markets that you can play with here both from a taste point point of view consumption point of view ethnic point of view habits point of view family values point of view or patriotical society versus a matriarchal society versus just a very democratic society the whole younger generation this to me this thing of tomorrow is better than yesterday psychology is a very very haunting one to me it's it's haunting well i like the word haunting because it's like you know it then there's it's in the room it's omnipresent and you should it's something you need to take into account because when you have that sentiment and if you can create that sentiment it's a it's a mind it's a mindset change moment if you do believe that and it's something for you to introspect do i really believe tomorrow is better than yesterday everyday tomorrow is going to be better than yesterday okay and that if you look at it it sounds like it's just a nice simple firmly optimistic believing sentence but you need to actually change your mind and believe in that and you'll find behavioral patterns in a very different manner your answer to work life balance will change your answer to so many other things that you angst angst about may go away what are you looking to movie before you invest in it so firstly i don't think i'd i if i have an investment mindset i'll i'll crash and burn what kind of movies you create do you feel like oh this is gonna work in movie i think i understand consumers and i keep wanting to understand consumers in a different manner number one number two i wanna be true to storytelling in the way i want to necessarily do it because i what is that like what do you understand about consumers yeah so obviously today more than ever before outside of the fact that this is an entertainment sector i think people definitely want a certain sense of context and a certain sense of realism so i think the movies we've made versus see i came from the outsider so being an outsider to me the song dance family approach and you know everything goes and either that or the dishum dishum or just hardcore nonsensical but it works you know hardcore leave your brains behind i did i can't relate with that i wouldn't be able to make it better i'd only make it worse so i stayed out of it so then therefore from my early days whether it was swadesa whether it was rangde basanti those were the breakout stories that appealed to me right and i guess maybe to that extent in those early days i do believe that i was part of the formula that allowed it to happen maybe if i hadn't backed it maybe somebody else would not have backed it and therefore it may not have happened but being the outsider gave you the sense that if i stay with my values now i was not doing it saying i want to talk about an audience that i don't know exist i don't make movies myself because if i did i would not make ninety nine percent of the movies that i would make because what i want to see if i want relaxing versus what i want to see from what i want to do as a passion are two different things so to me i think getting the message across having a sense of realism that doesn't mean that's everyone should do that but i'm seeing there's so many people doing the other stuff in any case that one more person doing that doesn't make any sense so that's my way of storytelling now when i was running it as a business to what i'm doing today with rsvp as a passion are two different things and the reason is when you're running a business fifty sixty percent of your decisions are what you have to do yeah and forty percent what you want to do when you're doing it as a passion hundred percent better be what you want to do and nothing that you have to do because it's a passion yeah you don't have to do it you don't have to get up in the morning and play golf you don't have to go to the squash court you don't have to play chess or whatever it is you want to do so that is a very liberating sense of being able to then do what you want to do because you can say no ninety nine times when you're running a business you can't say no ninety nine times a lot of people are doing what they used to do in bollywood and do you feel that's the reason why it's struggling right now or or is it just because of ott and the south cinema has gotten no like super successful like no no south cinema has always been around and they tell great stories yeah but and they're just they're just looking much better and shining much better because of the simple reason that they're doing exactly what they were doing and staying focusing on it innovating and doing it better so yes i think here because there's you you talked about like sense of realism right like in so i don't wanna be judgmental but i think we've taken our audience for granted here and i think that's the problem right and we haven't made the change and even the main problem is when you're an insular industry and i'm not saying we necessarily are and i don't wanna be critical because i'm very much part of it i'm very proud of it because the creative industry does have a strong impact but when you're insular and when you're clannish you just say the same thing again and when you're you're with people who finish the sentence for you it's the most dangerous place to be in because of every meeting somebody can finish the sentence for you going out saying i don't know what a culture what are we it's so nice we're all we're all so hum sorry but where's the diversity and what's going on outside and how do you gonna figure this part out and who's gonna challenge you and then you're then you're in your own world and you're in la la land fun you're in your own world then you're in la la land and then you're irrelevant mhmm so it's not because of ott or the world or it's it's just about we're not being those those changes will be there in any case but thank god for ott right thank god for ott because the simple reason that good creative people are getting an opportunity to write even better scripts for a much wider audience and what you've done is now an audience has actually got used to a different level of of storytelling mhmm and now finds it very difficult to just be in suspension of reality or look at a star because the context of star and actor and larger than life has also changed for a lot of people right i mean in the younger generation complete iconic situations are very different a twenty million you know tiktok view a viewer is is very different than twenty millions of twitter with an actor coming to the last topic of the day why do you feel like giving back is really important i feel because and at the young age as well like yeah i think that was my balance i think it's a root sometimes uncomfortable in their work life balance therefore they're feeling unsatisfied with their life in some form or the other and i know i'm i'm not trying to be a mockery because there are people who are thinking between the two hours it's so easy for you to do but i commute two hours each day each way then i come home i'm fagged out my family my kids i don't see them growing up i'm being made to travel those are ground realities i fully get that but you can manage a fair bit of that is what i think you can be at least fifty percent in the control of your destiny giving back is a very powerful medium and i think it gave me a lot of balance because at that early age and i don't know why it's a little bit like i wanted to be an entrepreneur i didn't know what i wanted to do i've i became something in media and entertainment as i gave you because of serendipity of doing theater and whatever else the same way i don't know why but when you when we started something my first thing was that you know about ten percent of what we do we'll do for giving back and at that stage again with no balance the for me we had a ten thousand square foot office that we had rented and at one thousand square foot of that we had started a old age home a little bit of a creche and an orphanage kind of situation and that was extremely binding because nobody went home at six thirty seven everyone would we had thirty people and the people all thirty people gravitated to that till eight nine ten because suddenly it was a different part of them and i saw the culture building in an organization at that very early stage but i wanted to do that so i think this thing about i can't make a difference singularly which i think today the generation feels i think is wrong and i know that when we did in two thousand six rangde basanti and i remember amed rakesh and me going to delhi university and we they were you know in that large quadrangle there were almost ten thousand students and after the screening they said sir this is nice because you know it's a the the heroes die in the end and whatever else and but the but the cry at that time was i can't make a difference yeah it's okay you can make this statement what are you saying are you saying i can make a difference and i think that's changed today where people do feel singularly we can make a difference and i think in the giving back individuality is very very important it's not about money it's about the mindset of that balance and i think you'll get your work life balance because if you're slightly more blessed than the next person you'll let you look at life in a very different perspective and i've come from a lower middle class household so i can identify with that journey that i've taken that at every stage if i look back over my shoulder and say but if i've come here what about this person and you know what about that person or i was privileged in the last five years of my life to go to a good school like cathedral but before that i went to an even good school called dunns institute right where it was it was a challenging environment then today i still sponsor at least about seven to ten kids from that institution but that's just because you're looking over your shoulder so i think it's not a categorization and i feel sure there are enough people who say make a pledge i think that's all fine and it's nice because maybe bill gates and buffett have at least made philanthropy a little bit more high profile but i'm not it's it's a very personal thing but i would say for everyone in the younger you can do your balance it gives you a very strong purpose even if it's ten percent it's like your wallet share in that wallet share you don't need to spend one rupee of it but take ten percent of your mind share and it'll make a big difference so it's either you give back via time or you give back via wallet share or like money my daughter runs a mentor mentee program at about seven hundred and ninety nine thousand dollars the lighthouse project and i've spoken to a lot of people and the you know they're they're young professionals or college going kids who adopt a kid and you need to spend about a day a month with that and actually most of them spend much more but the impact it's had on the mentors is more than it's had on the mentees so i think it's a strong message for anyone wanting to look at a balance in life forget work life balance mind balance mind share balance very important i see it's like self help and help others both the categories you should be there yeah and then my mom says you know my mom says like you guys keep reading about self help self help self help you need to have a lesson in your life which says help others absolutely like start reading books where you're supposed to be in that early stages while you may be helping somebody else you are big time helping yourself for the future so introspect on the impact it's having on you also there is an roi for you not an roi for somebody else when you're doing that so be selfish when you're giving when you're being selfish you'll get self you'll get a lot of self conviction on yourself and that you'll be able to you'll just be able to you'll feel that alright on that note thank you so much for having like a lovely conversation thank you i think we are i think it floored yeah i think it was very natural and obviously you have a lot of curiosity that brought about a very diverse set set i didn't see you looking at any notes ever it was more about speaking out didn't ask you about lot of notes now i don't know like so so many things but best way for something is for the water to flow yeah yeah thank you so much for watching this episode till the end please let us know in the comments if you like this guest if you didn't like the guest what question do you want us to ask from the next guest which is coming until the next episode keep figuring out and don't forget to share it with at least one person because one conversation can give hundred ideas and out of those hundred ideas if one can implement even one in their lives then their indian dream will come true
