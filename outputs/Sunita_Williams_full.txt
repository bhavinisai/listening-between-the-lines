how does india look like from spain looking at india in the daytime colors are amazing the himalayas are absolutely amazing as you can see when the rivers run off how they interact night india is pretty spectacular the cities are lit up and all those lights seems to be like connected sunita williams and butch wilmore are still stuck in space and and are not expected to return ten day test flight turned into a nine month long mission in space this after their boeing starliner phase thruster failed this time this flight the last one was pretty messed up once after we launched and then we got to the space station we knew we weren't gonna come home as planned we knew it would be six more months when you're in space and coming home is byproduct of this business it's risky how many situations do you plan for oh gosh hundreds trained for two years for a launch of a spacecraft mhmm because we go through with our control team hey what if this failed what if that failed and what's the probability of this and that happenings was there any point where you heard some sound and you got scared we were all a little on edge when in this latest flight when we had a satellite below us in orbit explode and then there was a bit of a debris field and so we were woken up in the middle of the night to all go to our own spacecraft it's called safe haven and we all sort of hugged each other hopefully i'll see you on earth did you feel lonely in one of those two eighty six days people that you end up living in space they become family have you cried in space oh absolutely absolutely i miss people and i miss my dog so of course i cried what was the most difficult part for you of the training like if i have to just go do something it doesn't bother me i've trained i've done it like spacewalk stuff robotic stuff doesn't make me nervous but academics in college were hard for me before you set a foot on your first flight you saw what happened with kalpana chawla she's a friend of yours she's a role model and you saw her death this day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country that colombia's lost there are no survivors did that event change anything new i think the desire to explore more i think it gave us even more of a feeling of like we really wanna continue this we've gotta do this in their memory we're not gonna let their situation put a stop on it they wouldn't want that so we're gonna press harder what's the health cost cost you pay when you come back for me i always feel a little nauseous when i come back the neurovestibular system has not been working while you're up in space it's sort of shut down and you have other feelings of orientation while you're up there for me i felt pretty nauseous for like twenty four hours do you believe there's some life out there absolutely with those billions of stars out there we're just a little planet around one star so yeah there's life out there how does space smell like tell me about your biggest insecurity what's the strangest thing you've seen in the space which you think is going to be hard to believe for people here interesting before starting today's episode i have a small request the whole team and i are working very hard to bring bigger and bigger guests for you so that we can give you more value and learnings through better conversations and to continue doing that i need you to subscribe our channel it's free and takes only two seconds and we promise that if you do this we'll keep bringing the top one percent guest from all around the world and make you prouder one day our today's guest has done nine spacewalks spent more than sixty two hours walking in space more than any other woman in human history very few women get to lead the international space station and she's not just commanded the iss once but twice she has been part of three epic iss missions spent six hundred eight days in space the second most of any nasa astronaut ever i'm talking about sunita williams the woman who's flown forty different aircraft served as a navy captain and is also the first human being ever to have run a marathon in space and just last year she was stranded in space for nine months when a spacecraft failed the whole world washed but she didn't panic she took the charge and in this conversation we'll figure out the training the mindset the sacrifices it took to become one of the greatest female astronauts in the world and what does it take to build a mindset where you can be calm when everything is going against you i'm just really really honored to do this i just wanted you to know this well thank you it's fun it's great to be here it's great to have a podcast i know it opens up to another audience so thank you for the invitation everybody knows you but let's say if zero point zero one percent people don't know you okay then what about your childhood you would tell them which has shaped you the person who you are today i think the biggest thing about my childhood that shaped me was i came from a family that was multicultural multi religions multi food most important i guess and and that's a really it's a big benefit i didn't you know you don't realize it when you're a kid you know it's just it's life it's how it is but i think just appreciation for different cultures at a young age not even realizing it i think was really beneficial and set me up for success i would say just because i i feel like i can relate to a lot of different people or at least have the patience to listen for a moment at what point in your childhood you felt like this is a strength like my being multicultural is a strength oh gosh i don't think i realized it for a long time for a while like it it was a little bit i think more so we were different we are a different family and we all knew that but i don't know i didn't know if it was a strength until later on in life where just easy to deal with people i think that was what do you mean by different well we were the only indian family in our town okay or partially indian family so i think we stuck out pretty much my sister and i had long hair of course long indian hair while we were growing up we were also swimmers and so we were the type that got up in the morning and swam before school coming into school with wet hair and so we were just different in regards to other people in the town i think people knew who we were then too the pandias yeah yeah did you at any point feel like that was maybe a weakness or that maybe put you in a different light than other people oh sure like as a kid you know of course when you're like a kid or more so like when you're an early t do you you're when you don't blend in with everybody else and you're a little bit different of course that's a little bit uncomfortable but it also at the same time i was i think confident secure in myself that i you know i thought the more important thing was athletics and academics and i didn't really didn't really bother me that much were you insecure at any point absolutely my whole life i think every and i think everybody is they just have to sort of push through it and i think that's part of part of life is just like pushing through boundaries and things that make you feel a little uncomfortable and that's where you can achieve more so yeah absolutely tell me about your biggest insecurity gosh my biggest i don't know about my biggest i mean just my whole job from being you know like first of all as a athlete as a you know you get on the starting blocks you're nervous right so that's one thing you're a little bit insecure about your capabilities and your abilities gets proven in the pool or on the track or wherever it is but you know just getting to that starting point as they say is is a little bit scary and then just i think in all of the things that i in my career that i've done i had major insecurities about it like wow am i am i gonna be able to pass this checkride am i gonna be able to be a pilot am i gonna be able to know how to do a spacewalk am i gonna be able to do the robotic arm i would think all those all those things i think there's points of insecurity yes you prepare as best as you can but then at this at one point in time at least myself i doubt myself at times you know like do that today absolutely i think we all do it i think we all do that like if you don't then you're not really being introspective i think true i think it's hard to think that you know everything and not have an appreciation for the rest of the world around you that might have a surprise for you what are you insecure about today like you've accomplished so many things now a a lot i mean the next steps of my life what am i gonna do in the next steps of my life i you know i wanna we're moved i'm retired we've moved what am i gonna do i don't know and i i may think i'm insecure about it but i don't really care because it's gonna be it's all good i know better now it's all gonna work out i wish i had known that when i was a kid you know because i think those insecurities take over a little bit more when you're younger when you don't realize it's all gonna work out you know it's so fascinating you do like your main work is uncertainty for living like that's what you don't know what's gonna happen the next moment and your you think about what's gonna happen next that's like you're insecure about the uncertainty in your life like what's gonna happen now but you have lived all your life just thinking about let's live in the moment and not think about what's gonna happen next yes and i think you you bring up a good point let's i think that is the way you deal with it like let's live in the moment like i think people have insecurities of course when they look in the future and you but you can't you can't make it you can guide it but you can't anticipate every little thing so living in the in the moment is i think the best methodology you know you say a lot about that you made a pivot every time things don't work out you made a pivot so you wanted to become something else in the childhood uh-huh then you applied for certain things you didn't get in and then you finally ended up becoming who you are today how did you know that this is something that you don't wanna give up because everything every time when it didn't work out you just pivoted you're like maybe not for me not for me not for me and then well i i i like this is another thing i think i wish i knew when i was a younger kid that you know things work out for a reason maybe it's because you have better qualifications in one area than another although you think this is what you might wanna do and be ready for those extra doors to open that you didn't even anticipate so those are things that i like i said i wish i had known then because i think i was a little bit more had more anticipation maybe a little bit more nervousness about it when i was younger versus just like sort of going with the flow because like let's just see what's behind the next door because it might be something that i never even imagined and things like that so that's why i mentioned this when i'm talking to kids about this this younger age pivot about trying to know what you wanna do when you're seventeen that seems almost ridiculous now that i look back and think about it and i ask and i find myself asking kids too like what do you wanna be when you grow up what do you wanna do when you grow up how the heck do they know it's sort of a silly question to ask them it's more more should be like what are you what are you interested in what what what kinds of things are have you been exposed to or what what do you do you wanna do something else or can i guide you to a direction that might be something that you never even thought of you know that's i think more appropriate questions honestly now that i look back at the whole thing because how the heck do you know what you wanna do when you're a kid and you and i think that causes a lot of anxiety and stress with people and you don't need to have that true what got you interested in this in space in nasa in the things that you do it wasn't really a straight shot so it wasn't what i wanted to do when i was a kid even when i was a pilot i really wasn't a helicopter pilot it wasn't the first thing on my list it wasn't until later that i got exposed to it so that's why i say like when i was just mentioning like for if i'm talking to a kid like how can i expose you to something else like like just take a look at you know the space space program take a look at aviation and those are my backgrounds right take a look at diving or you know expose them to some other person adult that has done something different just so they get an idea of things that are out there anyway it wasn't until i met somebody who had gone to space had gone to johnson space center and then i was like wow this job looks like fun and some of those people were my friends that i had known as a test pilot so i trusted their opinion also so getting to know more and more people who are in the jobs that potentially you might like is a good idea so like if i i had not really talked to a veterinarian beside what for when i went to the vet with my dog so probably i should have done like some type of internship somewhere with a veterinarian to find out if i really like that but i hadn't didn't do that true so but let's say you got interested in it but before you enter i'm assuming like before you enter a rocket they would test you in some way right maybe mentally physically there would be some kind of training going on oh absolutely when you first get to become an astronaut wherever you're gonna be an astronaut if it's you know an american astronaut at johnson space center european in cologne or you know japanese in at jaxa or if you're going to be like shukla in the end and do it like an axiom flight you're going to be tested one way or the other here or during the process to one become an astronaut and then two and you're on your journey to get trained to be ready to go so there's testing all the way along the way so that's sometimes intimidating right and going back to the insecurities a little bit that's sort of like wow i've never learned how to do this before i don't know if i know how to do a robotic move the rope you know operate the robotic arm or you know get ready for a spacewalk how am i gonna learn how to do this and you know you find the mentors the people who have done it before same all the way back in grades it's full circle like it's like having you know talking to a kid about something that they might wanna do and find out as much as you can and learn as much as you can and and study and and figure it all out and actually if you have to studying means also like for spacewalks work out right because it's it's physically demanding so you know what you need to do the the background for each of those things and do the best that you can is there any psychological screening that you go through oh yeah yeah there is definitely some testing like just on paper testing i'm not really sure what all that indicates but there is some of that maybe it's just to annoy you because you have to take a lot of you live for do a lot of written tests i don't know what it's for exactly but then there's parts where we are looking at astronauts together as they're getting interviewed giving them a problem that's very hard to solve and seeing how they do that and that's not just like a a paper problem like a you know like take this whatever this table and move it over this bridge and around this water and put it there and and put people in groups and see who naturally falls out as a leader who naturally you know adds to the team so we wanna make sure we have team players because none of this is done by ourselves yeah and then we also do along the path when you're getting trained during the time for that you're waiting we go to national outdoor leadership school so you learn a little bit about yourself as well as other people because you're it's taking you away out of the scenario to some place maybe you're backpacking maybe you're doing rafting or something where you're in an uncomfortable situation you're not sleeping in your own bed you're sleeping in a tent you're making your own food you're going to the bathroom in weird places you know getting your all getting you sort of ready for working as a team and then finding out where your hot spots are where your points are that that make you uncomfortable i'm i like organizing you know my stuff you know everybody has their little nest whenever they're have the the things that they have and when somebody doesn't and their stuff's all over the place it a little bit drives me crazy and i so i know that about myself so i know when i might encounter a crewmate that has stuff like all over the place that might it might cause me anxiety but that's my problem and i have to deal with that so does that make sense yeah so you understand more about yourself because you can't change other people what was the most difficult part for you the most difficult part of the training of training i get nervous about tests i think it's it's more like just when you have to do rote memorization i think that's what i was sort of well i was a lot insecure about if you wanna go back to that well during my college academics i i struggled i did really well in high school so i so i had a base because i had went to a really good high school mhmm in our public high schools but academics in college were were hard for me just taking tests were hard understanding you know i don't know whatever written tests are hard so that carries that's carried through my whole life so whenever i have a written test i i can feel that i get a little bit nervous about it actually doing something i don't get nervous about like if i have to just go do something it doesn't bother me like i just i've trained i've done it like spacewalk stuff robotic stuff doesn't make me nervous i just sort of put the things together logically in my head and i can do the task but memorizing things and writing stuff down that's that's not that's that's the tough part that's tough for me but but what happens like is it not tough when five thrusts are failing you're like in the middle of situation where it's like chaotic you don't know what's going to happen i think you know like isn't that tough like you have to compartmentalize that particular moment yeah compartmentalization is something that we've trained to do quite a bit like just with our military training as a military pilot because you can only fix one thing at a time and you have to just know your systems well enough to understand what capabilities you have and how you're gonna work with those capabilities so as the thrusters were were failing yes this is a bad situation butch and i looked at it at each other and we're like oh this is not so good but we knew what we needed to do we needed what we really needed to do was talk to the space station because we didn't know how our spacecraft would react if we were doing other maneuvers at that point in time so that was the biggest thing and i think i mean just like the movie the martian mhmm if you look at how he solved problems it's like one little bite at a time when you have a big problem you can't you can't deal with it right it's too much it's overwhelming i think just in life that happens too sometimes you like i don't know if you're wanna change something at your house sometimes the project looks too big and you just have to take one little bite at a time okay i'm just gonna start with painting or i'm just gonna start you know with picking out something that i have to add to my house same thing happens with these big problems so i with thrusters like okay we we can't go outside and fix them so we have to deal we have to deal with what we have and we have to just handle this situation and we didn't start thinking about at least i didn't think start thinking about how we are gonna come home i thought like let's just focus on docking and everything because there's many parts of all of that and make sure that is all squared away if that doesn't happen then we'll work on the next thing so you solve things one piece at a time i think that's how you solve big problems but is there any mental technique that helps you keep calm during the time of chaos is there some kind of breath work that you do is it some kind of visualization technique something that you do or you just trained yourself so much that you don't care like it just comes naturally i think it comes naturally at this point honestly i've we've all been in situations flying aircraft that something doesn't work quite right and you just sorta have to figure it out and get it on the ground as when you can i mean i have my own little aircraft and that situation happened at one point in time when the winds picked up quite a bit and i had to just sort of figure out like okay we're not gonna land here we're not gonna land here we're not gonna we're gonna land here but at some point in time we have to land we're running out of gas so so know you have to make that situation happen right same thing with spacewalks too like you know something might not go well right from the get go but it doesn't mean you you stop and you just don't do anything on my first spacewalk i lost a camera you know you just can't you can't just sit there and be sad about these things you just have to move on and and pick at the pieces up and just go with what you have and the same thing with the thruster situation on starliner and you know we knew that there would be a plan we have what we practice quite a bit with our mission control team about what we call like no radio procedures nor do procedures and so if we didn't weren't able to communicate with them i think we would have already had a a plan to go into ten meters and wait there and try to figure out how the spacecraft flew if the spacecraft didn't fly very well then we would back away because we wouldn't wanna put the state space station in danger how many situations do you plan for before you go oh gosh hundreds and that's what all that training is for so people sometimes say like why do you have to train for two years for a launch of a spacecraft because we go through with our control team all of the different things that not us only them all of them think of hey what if this failed what if that failed and what's the probability of this and that happening so people have talked through all of that as much as they can so it's it was interesting actually i was just talking to somebody about an electric airplane i'm like what kind of failures do you have there because usually when you were thinking about failures of something mechanical like your car there's oil there's gas there's mechanical parts so if it's an electric vehicle what problems do you have there so batteries obviously so it's a whole different you know every every mechanical thing has some some type of problems and so you just gotta be creative in the way you think about the failures has it ever happened that you've trained for everything and still something new has happened oh the thruster failure but obviously it was you know we've trained for failure you know thruster problems and we've actually flown the simulator with one or two thrusters not working and of course the controls are sloppy so five was a big deal and and actually went against some of our flight rules about how we were gonna operate the spacecraft and so so that's when the control team came into play and then they turned off some of the monitoring systems as well as restarted the engines and that way we were able to at least get controllability make sure we had controllability in all six axis because we lost in one and then we were able bypassing some flight rules because they usually say that it has to be redundant mhmm we we went in and tried to dock and were successful so that was great has it ever happened that some astronaut has has like broken psychologically like at one point they've just maybe they were not able to take it no i i mean i think the training is good enough that we we make sure we we send everybody up that's has that those tools in their tool belt and they'll be okay i mean everybody understands stress a little bit different and like i said that's why we do some of that yeah national outdoor leadership school so you can understand that and you can see that when you're with your other crewmates you know some people like some time by themselves some people are very chatty you know when they get stressed out so there's it it's gonna happen everyone's gonna it's gonna happen at some point in time so to a degree though everybody's in a box in a controllable box you know so have you cried in space oh absolutely absolutely i miss people and i miss my dog so of course i cried you know that yeah absolutely there's there's been goods and bads i mean and also like for for really good things that have happened too a friend of mine her mom was sick while we were in space and just having those conversations you know that's just you know your your your friends your colleagues if someone told you you know your their parent was sick and they've been having some problems and you know that that's hard to deal with and so you're you're helping somebody else and you're just being a friend shoulder that somebody can like lean on and this you know same thing happens like i get frustrated with something and i'm talking to my one of the crewmates up there about something or something that's happening at home yeah absolutely yeah everybody everyone has everyone goes through the it's normal emotions here as as in there yeah so what happens when you cry in space your tears don't fall oh yeah everything water all around you gets just sort of balled up on you same with like when you're working out it's you get super sweaty because stuff just gets like too much water everywhere so you need a couple tissues so like you just start crying like is it difficult is it like just stuck so just will just make your eyes very watery like really watery you gotta get rid of that though so you can see and you'll be like a fish in an aquarium i have to ask you a weird question like what what's the worst part about using a bathroom in space oh gosh so much bad about it the gravity no gravity assist so you for me i you know first of all you just absolutely just being able to do it first the first thing right because you need to get rid of everything at some point in time get rid of all that bad stuff so you have to go to the bathroom so doing it first of all get getting over the fear of like going because you know it's not gonna fall down so i was like okay you just gotta go and turn the hose on and it will it'll take it away and don't worry about it so then and then the number two part that's also adds a your body's not used to it so you have to sort of get your body used to those muscles to push everything out the right way and then and then it's just sort of i wait i wait till i'm ready to go and then i could just go i think that takes care of it that takes care of all the the washy washy about it if you can't really you have to commit you have to just get in there and just go you also said i was reading somewhere you said that people fought a lot up there oh yeah yeah there's a lot and i don't know why exactly but it just happens everybody does because if it's the preservatives in the food or something like that i'm not really sure why but everybody everybody does and i think after a while potentially people get used to it and it seems like it happens a little less for some people but sometimes for other people it just keeps going on it's terrible and then you have to live up in that space for like the days and it smells bad no it it'll move it'll move we have we have a pretty good ventilation system so stuff starts to move around pretty quick but if you if somebody farted and you you're like right behind them flying through the module you're gonna fly right through it how does space smell like it smells like us smells like the food that we eat it smells like us but you know like interestingly enough i think it's not that bad because like we had at some periods of time twelve people on the space station when generally seven and people are all working out people are all eating and it to me it didn't didn't smell that bad at all i mean it was just sometimes a little stronger when some stronger types of food i eventually got indian food for example so you could smell that mhmm some things with garlic you know obviously you could smell that i i actually really like the smell of garlic so it's for me it was fine sometimes fish because we had like a lot of salmon or tuna fish and so that's sticks around for a little bit longer maybe but it all ends up dissipating so that that smell what about the sound because iss it creaks and moans right like it just you can hear that sound almost all the time some areas it it also depends on what the sunlight what how our orbit is in comparison to the sun so sometimes when we're getting heated up quite a bit there's some areas which sort the metal sort of just pops and bends a little bit and then that was reported obviously somebody was like oh what happened and so then then we realized what the situation is so whenever there's like a lot of sun on these parts are called the pressurized mating adapter because they're black on the outside if you look at different parts of the space station you'll see most of it's silver which is sort of reflective but some of it is this black part and that's the part that gets really hot makes those creaks and moans and bumps other things beside for that are some of the ventilation mhmm and you could hear stuff kick on start up and and shut down that happens periodically obviously you can find it on the you know if you go into the computer page where it has the system that has that specific system you'll probably see what happens have you heard any scary sound like what's the scariest sound you've heard i'm just like childlike curious right now at this point yeah but when you were stuck like for two eighty six days what's the most scariest sound you heard gosh i'm trying to think of something i think valves moving closing and opening i don't know i'm i am used to the space station the space station is sort of like a second home so my first time up there i'm looking at it up on the wall that's why i'm looking this i'm trying to think of what was what was scary but my first time there when i was in the forward part of the space station living there by myself with my two other russian colleagues in the way back yeah i got scared a little bit because first time i'm like very hypersensitive to all of these switching of pumps and fans and noises one antenna out right outside our former there was a crew quarters there would turn every now and then night or i think it was a camera actually and sometimes the folks in mission control would turn it so they could see stuff and it was like right outside the window so we could hear in inside so i was asking a lot of questions during that flight like what's that what's that what's that but now that you i've lived there for a long time i feel like i know most of the things that are happening or i can figure it out like okay that that sounds like a motor that sounds like a valve so that must be coming from over here so this is this so you know it's just like as though you've like yet lived at your house for a long time so you get used to like when the furnace kicks on or something and to drink you know they're like oh yeah that's happening again but when but for the first time you must have heard at that time did it scare you the first time it did because particularly when i was the like i said the only person living in that part of the space station and my other american counterpart had gone home and you know this is my responsibility was this part of the space station i was like oh what what is that what is that what is that so i ended calling the ground a couple times probably in the in that time frame if i remember correctly just sort of is that normal is that normal and they're like yes yes don't worry about it was there any point where in all your time in in space was there any point where you heard some sound and you're like oh this is it like this like you froze for a moment and like you got scared no i i wouldn't say that i think we were all a little on edge when in this latest flight when we had a satellite below us in orbit explode or disintegrate or something and then there was a bit of a debris field and so we were woken up in the middle of the night to all go to our own spacecraft it's called safe haven because the space they weren't sure whether or not the debris would hit the space station so we had about forty five minutes and the funny part about that is we all met at the bathroom essentially one last time to go to the bathroom on the as i call it the big hotel in space because the spacecraft are sort of like a little camper so they don't have really good bathrooms on the spacecraft and so it was like you know take advantage of okay i've got forty five minutes what am i gonna do i'm gonna go to the bathroom i'm gonna get some water say hug my friends say goodbye that was a little bit surreal situation i think not because of the bathroom the bathroom was just sort of funny but as we were leaving three spacecraft that have human beings that are gonna return to earth so one spacecraft's gonna go and land in the ocean one's gonna land around the united states one's gonna land in the desert in kazakhstan one's gonna land in the desert in the united states and we all sort of hugged each other and we're like hopefully i'll see you on earth you know that was a little bit weird and i wasn't necessarily scared just sort of you know maybe stop for a moment and go like wow this is this would be bad if we all had to leave and then we leave the space station we had some things we had to do to make sure the space station was in a safe configuration as much as possible closing hatches getting things ready so we didn't have time too much time to sit around and think about it but for it for a second that flashed through my mind as we were all there by the bathroom and we're giving each other a couple little hugs saying goodbye so that was weird that was a little unsettling i guess so you said this this time this flight the last one was pretty pretty messed up right when you got stuck at you when you got stuck for two eighty six days i don't know if it i would say messed up is the right word i would say it was a little bit unpredictable in the beginning like that whole summer was like like unfortunately that was the hardest part i think the beginning part for once after we launched and then we got to the space station we knew we weren't gonna come home as planned but there was a lot of people on the ground who were still working to we're gonna get home we're gonna come home tomorrow we're gonna come home tomorrow we're gonna home tomorrow like wait a minute we all have to understand what the problem is and understand what the fix is and all that kind of stuff but of course nasa doesn't wanna miss an opportunity so they still had a lot of people turned on to keep working through all this so that so that meant there was questions coming to up us and we were answering questions back and forth when when it seemed like the probability was pretty slim that we'd coming back in the next you know two weeks or months we really needed to get some answers to what happened and understand that problem and see if there's a adequate fix before we would get back in that spacecraft so that whole time frame you know it's hard to have patience right i think all of us have to work on that they say patience is a virtue and it's very true because it's sort of like when something uncontrollable is happening you just had us have to sort of wait until the appropriate answer is provided that's hard because you sort of wanna go how's it going down there how's it going have you have you solved the problem yet you know like what what is the answer do we know yet and you you sort of have to give people some time so we tried our best i think we were sort of annoying at some points in time in asking the questions and try and it's it's hard when you're up in space it's like during covid when we had zoom calls it was really hard to really you know get to the bottom of some things right because you had to just you couldn't see somebody you couldn't go and put your hands on something you're not right there and that's what it's sort of like all the time on the space station we aren't there i'm not seeing the test setup i i don't know what all the parameters are i i listen to the the meetings but you know how it is in zoom calls right sometimes your your mind is doing something else when you should you can come back to what's going on right so it's a little bit it was hard to really be part of this the solution process it was easy to ask questions but it's hard to be part of the process and so that that was a little frustrating i think the not so frustrating part at first but then became frustrating was my family i think they were wonderful at first like oh you know just come home be safe it's all that it's all good you know like you know you're gonna be home soon you know you'll be home by the falls it's all good so you know so then i think the hard harder part of course is like turning that and telling folks that you're not gonna be home for a little longer and so you know at the by the end i think we were both butch and i before even the decision was made we had an idea that this is not gonna happen and we knew the next time we'd come home is with the next spacecraft i mean this is the this is the process we've been living for a long time we know that every six months there's a spacecraft that goes up and there's a spacecraft that comes home mhmm and they're not gonna change that it's very expensive it's a it's a contract it's a you know it's the production of the spacecraft so that's how it's gonna go so as the sum summer went on and it was getting clear that we probably weren't gonna come home we knew it would be six more months so that's when like making those phone calls like like around the you know august time frame like i'm not coming home for a little while we'll see you next year but but i think i'm very very fortunate my family was like hey it's okay you know don't worry about it have a good time come home on a safe spacecraft and i wrote journals on my first two missions and i started it started it while we were up there for the summer and my sister's like just keep writing the journals because they're fun to read i'm like oh okay and you know and it's not just fun it's i have a a group of people that i sent those to so it it was able i was able to take a lot of people along on the journey with me and show them through my photographs not just mine but my crewmates photographs and what we were doing up there what it's like to live in work and space and you know the aperture gets widened when you have time to do that so it'll i had a lot of people following along with me and you know because i was doing that a lot of support from friends and family so that was pretty awesome so that first time when you when you got this feeling that hey maybe you're not going home and you're definitely you're asking questions to the ground support you're asking questions but when you're alone you're not asking questions and you're impatient what going what's going on in your head like now you know you're not gonna go home for a while oh yeah so i mean right from the beginning anyway we had things to do for our spacecraft while it's stuck to the space station those test points just working so we did we just kept that whole process right what we had already planned to do for the those next ten days and we had a little extra time so we're doing some of little extra tests so that was great and then after that you know we had some free time essentially which and i of course we had we worked out so it's just how do we help how do i put be part of the team you know i need to occupy my time with that type of stuff i like doing that i'm i'm not gonna sit around and feel sorry for myself it's like hey there's twelve of us up here we're going through a lot of food how about if i transfer the food and put it in the right place how about if i work on the toilet because we're going through the toilet supplies faster than than we should so how can i help out and just help the team the things that are like you know standard things that you have to do like take the trash out you know like all the things that we normally do here at home there's there's specific things we do that we train for then there's things that we've that you just have to do on a routine basis so just try to jump in and help the team as much as possible you don't give yourself time just just keep yourself occupied all the time i i do generally try i i don't like to hang out just hang out that's sort of silly specifically in space there's there's a lot of things to do it's like never a dull moment and then once it was sort of not not not even then i think just in general if there was free time and somebody was working on an experiment sometimes your hands are in a glove box and you know then you need to get something to do something you gotta take your hands out of the glove box it's a little bit of production or you have protective equipment on because you're working on something that's a little bit dangerous and so then you're trying to make a phone call that's hard because you have to undo everything and call back to the ground you know get everything off of you so when for me it was like oh if that person's working on the experiment how about if i'm i'm your right hand man if you need something just tell me i'll go go over here and get it for you or you know you're working on the toilet with all that stuff on i'll make the calls down to the ground and then we could work through all these things more efficiently so there's all of that to do too just to just to help out the team i mean and that's what we're trained to do you know just to help out and that makes the that makes time go by for one thing not that time you really want time to go by but that also just helps everybody out and of course the cool thing that we did while we i think we not not me in particular but my crewmates were really great photographers and so butch and don they ended up spending time like setting up different cameras to take some amazing time lapses and stuff like that too so there's always something to do while you're up there was there a night where you lost hope no no no no no no that's so funny that that's a question it is interesting that people said like and i understand i guess i could understand why just because of the press and the narrative that was going on that we were stuck in space i i really wasn't scared because i knew that there was hundreds of people if not thousands that are working on trying to figure out one what the problem is two can we fix it and three how do we get back so all of that was going on down on the ground i know that was all happening not even for one like moment you felt like maybe this is it i'm not going home no we actually even before our spacecraft left we designed some sort of makeshift seats on the on the dragon that was there so we had planned seats in case something happened in case we had another safe haven or something that we had to get in our spacecraft because of something that happened that was out of our control we actually had a seat in a spacecraft it wasn't a great seat it did it wasn't didn't have you know air breathing connections in a spacesuit but we did still have a seat so i mean there's always there's always something there's we we always plan on something those seats needed to be completed those seats needed to be completed before we told starliner to leave wow yeah never that's incredible no i mean i have a lot of because like from here down here like all the press all the news all the stuff that we read uh-huh it it looked like you're stuck like there's no hope for you to come back no no no no there's nasa and boeing fighting there are people just arguing with stuff going on and there are thousands of people making content on you and it just yeah it felt pretty scary and i genuinely have seen so much content where people were worried i i just do that wondering yeah yeah so i i like i said i understand why people would have that impression just because of what the narrative that was going on and the the the miscommunications i think back and forth and i think that's a little potentially unfortunate but did your family ever feel like no no that's because we were in touch all the time like i i spoke to them after coming back and did they have the same feeling that absolutely they never you probably saw my mom at some point in time on the news and she was she was not worried because i mean i'm talking to her i'm telling her that it's gonna be okay you know it's not not something they need to worry about the the the sort of what what i don't wanna call it like really makeshift but the the the seats in the dragon that wasn't a great scenario and we we have we talked about that and there was a little bit folks were not ready for that scenario like oh like what now we have to accommodate two more people in this dragon in case there's a problem how do we do it people came up with some great apollo thirteen solutions with these makeshift seats and stuff but this is not the professional right way to do it and so now we actually have a seat kit mhmm so if somebody from another spacecraft needs to transfer over to this one they'll be able to do that with a better seat and we'll be able to actually have extra space suits so we'll be able to do that we have we're working on i'm not sure the status of it but like being able to connect the air with another seat with a t like a like a y cable mhmm so all of those are great lessons learned because that was i think the worst part that wasn't a great platform to land somebody might have you know we did our best that we could do we actually had a medical doctor who had a lot of experience in this in this setup so he did as best as he can to try to come up with seats but that wasn't optimal it's not really the right way to do stuff so like i said that was that was the most uncomfortable louie burn those seats like i don't really wanna come home like this but but the probability right that that something would hit the space station after we had already had something happen was pretty low so in my estimation we we all take risks yeah we're in this business because it's risky not because but as as a byproduct of this business it's risky when you launch on a rocket when you're in space and coming home you you accept some of those risks so this was not out of the box i would say when you're up there you you go through multiple sunrises and sunsets in a day right i mean sixteen yeah sixteen sunrises and sixteen sunsets in twenty four hours some days would feel like very short some days would be very long right which one was the longest day for you so when you're on a ex a deployment or an expedition i think time changes just in your head right obviously it doesn't change in general but it changes as once we got to that point where we we knew we were gonna stay for a little bit longer it was almost like a reset it was almost like the start of the whole expedition all over again because okay other folks were leaving and then we were gonna be the normal seven so at that point in time it felt like it's just starting so time is normal somewhere in there there was a thought that we might not come home until may and somewhere around christmas like oh that might be long we'll be up here for a long period of time and so that was that's when time sort of slowed down a little bit and also i mean it goes hand in hand with activity level also we had just finished doing a lot of science experiments mhmm we were just getting ready to do some spacewalk stuff so we had a little bit of a lull time and so time was a little bit slow there and then it accelerates when activities happen again as soon as we started getting ready for spacewalks like a week and a half two weeks before the spacewalks things started going fast our first spacewalk was january sixteenth and then so right after new year's it was like oh my gosh now time is like accelerating then we had another one at the end of january and then it was like a breather for a second thinking okay now we have a lot of time again slow down and then they said okay now you're coming home in march mhmm all of a sudden and so then all of a sudden time really accelerated and everybody was like let's getting one last picture let's do the you know what did i wanna do before i left all of that was happening really quick so i think it goes in in in waves depending on activity level depending on the projection of when you might be home i'll go back to the very beginning the summer seemed a little bit long too that seemed like it was dragging on a little bit without decision did you feel did you feel lonely in one of those two eighty six days i don't know about lonely there was always people around but family wasn't yeah the family wasn't the people that you end up living in space with are like family though they become family like i you've probably seen pictures of us during christmas time thanksgiving and christmas where we you know we we tried to connect with family we actually had like in the united states there's a big parade macy's day parade for thanksgiving we had that on a screen so we could watch it sort of makes that connection back to home and on those on holidays we actually have some time off so it's nice to be able to call home mhmm and do like a video conference with people back at home too and you know do a tour show people around and it's fun to see your crewmates like at the dinner table and have them wave to your family and see each other's families and stuff like that too so i think when you get lonely you have an opportunity to one make some phone calls on the weekends or when you have some free time make some video calls and just try to see what's going on back at home and have folks back at home try to see what's going on up in space i reconnected with a lot of my relatives while i was up there which was wonderful some of my folks so the capability is there right and we all learned it from covid how to zoom and how to be in do video conferences sometimes not so successfully as everybody's talking on top of each other but you know some of my relatives here in india some of my relatives you know all over the country in united states would all get on and then i could talk to them and give them a tour around it was that was that was actually a lot of fun and makes it not feel like lonely of course when you hang up you're like oh you know i wish i was down doing this or you know when somebody's telling you some of the fun things that they're doing of course you wish you were there being part of that but then you pinch yourself for a second you just oh my god i'm living up in space this is so cool look like go to the window for a second and see how beautiful it is i mean i i really wasn't that lonely honestly not at all no no i miss my dogs mostly was it so you you never had the loneliest night in space you don't remember not really maybe i i feel like i'm a robot answering these questions but but you know i mean that's like i think one of the things that i would like people to realize like this is an amazing opportunity when you have an i mean even i think about when i was had deployments at sea you you get up in the morning maybe it's an attitude i don't know but you get up in the morning you go outside and you see some of the most beautiful sunrises that you can ever imagine in the middle of the ocean on a deployment same thing you get up in space and you go to the window and you don't know what you're gonna see i mean every day is like oh it's there you know it's a surprise or it's nighttime or what does lightning look like or whatever it's just incredible and you you also know that this is not gonna last forever you're gonna come home at some point in time i mean i think that's always on the back of my mind i was like this is a chance even on my first flight i was sad to leave i was like crying like when i left because i was like i don't know if i'll ever have this opportunity again and it's so incredible the what are the kind of dreams you get in space is it different oh interesting my father asked me the same question because he was a neuro was a neuroscientist and you know sometimes you dream about i think you dream about sometimes experience right so it was like dreaming about where you are what you're doing and then it gets a little bit crazy as all dreams do right so they're not reality but but like i was dreaming that i was in space i was dreaming that i was doing spacewalks i was also dreaming that i was back at home like it was so interesting that you could dream about both of those and i feel like when i've come back to earth i've also dreamed about being in space as well because i've had that experience it's it seems like it wears off though which is unfortunate as the farther and farther you get away from your space flight you sort of come out of that like it's like i don't dream as much about space anymore i used to when i first got back quite a bit but is it different when you dream here on earth and when you dream into space like is it the kind of dreams do you dream of falling do you dream of all the same i think the same in that regard but based on experience yeah yeah i mean i wasn't fall if if i was dreaming about space i wouldn't fall yeah exactly yeah so there there's nothing different about it do you hear like different kind of sounds because you're always constant in an environment which is either very silent or like very noisy oh it's noisy all the time all the time i think the most the biggest impression though is as you're getting ready to fall asleep before you're asleep you see like little like little pieces of light with your eyes closed and it's dark and the reason i guess it's it's radiation i think that's coming and so that it's not like what your eyes are seeing it's some radiation that's hitting some part of your brain which is triggering a vision of this little light flashes which is a little bit bizarre i i don't wouldn't say it's scary but it's a little unnerving because then you're just like oh what kind of radiation am i getting up here and i'm not protected you know that's that's some of those long term effects of being in space that are like i think in just in general health wise a little worrisome so you wanna protect yourself as much as possible what's the health cost you pay when you come back so like so i mean initially when you come back you're not feeling very good but that that goes away pretty quick what are you feeling like the moment you land on earth yeah back up like just two eighty six for me nauseous like a little sick and it didn't help that this time we landed in the water and then you know everybody was concentrating on the dolphins that were there outside of the capsule but if you look at all the while the dolphins are swimming or when we landed we went all the way over and then back up again and it was funny because the thing thought in my head was like oh no if we turn over all the way upside down that's not gonna be good but you know it was just sort of like casual thought like that like oh that's not gonna be good and then we came back up and we're sort of bobbing for a second like a cork like so if people don't feel good when they're on a boat think about it that way yeah you feel a little bit nauseous and you're gonna feel nauseous anyway for me i always feel a little nauseous when i come back the neurovestibular system has not been working while you're up in space it's sort of shut down and you have other feelings of orientation while you're up there you you're the way our we evolved our inner ear for balance is not is not needed while you're up in space because gravity is not affected on it so so anyway when you come back all of a sudden gravity's a player and then you for me i felt pretty nauseous for like twenty four hours and but something that's provocative as you say as they say is like getting out of your spacesuit when you put it over your head pitch your head up like that that really makes you feel a little sick so we get out of we're getting out of the spacecraft and we get out with on a like a sort of like a a little seat with people helping us because there's a big hole in the in the spacecraft for where the cargo is and so nobody wants to trip and fall getting out first of all because you're not feeling too good and then they just take us to the back where we can get out of our spacesuits right after that though once you're out of your suit and you're not feeling like you're gonna throw up you can stand up and we walked up the stairs to where the helicopter was and took us out of there so that still nauseous for me for about twenty four to forty eight hours is the big thing and usually you'll see people with somebody helping them supporting them just because all the little balance muscles that you use here on earth that you don't even realize and the small muscles in your neck all of that has to get recharged again that takes for me realistically to get all the way back about a month we work with our physical trainers for some certain exercises they give us tests along the way to see how we're doing see how we're improving and it's actually pretty cool to see your body like come back to human self again you know to earthly self again so so you feel you like when you come back for that month when you're trying to acclimatize adapt to the earth again do you feel like things are falling or like if you pick up the pen then it's just gonna go like that like you get these things you because i saw a video of yeah yeah yeah the liquid pineapple juice i saw that it happens for a little bit but you'll you'll you'll learn pretty quick that our gravity is the you know predominant force on this on this planet so you can't get away from it so it's here yeah it's not but you learn like pretty quickly but do you like you'll do something stupid first like i'll just drop this bottle like oh okay never mind so you do it you do one thing and then it's then it's like you're back yeah yeah yeah yeah and is it like more difficult for you to work after you come back for no no not really it's not difficult you're just gonna potentially fall over so so you so i mean just because of balance so you need that's why somebody usually helps i was just looking at even in a month oh no no no no just just for like two days or something yeah yeah and and usually i've we don't drive for a little bit just because you know you're just reaction time might be a little bit slow and so somebody will take us drive us to where we need to go for the first week and all your senses do do they work differently when you come back like the sound the smell i think enlightened to what's here on earth like i remember distinctly on my first mission we landed in the desert in california and the smell when they soon as they open the hatch the smell of dirt and sage because there's a lot of the sage plant there that smell was so predominant like wow like i could just we're back on a plant you know on planet earth again so it was it was wonderful it was nice because you things that you miss like all of that that and like wind those are like things that you really like oh my gosh i feel this and being in the first time in a shower feels really really good not just not because you're necessarily dirty because we don't really get dirty up there we just sweat and then you know take a sponge bath but just to feel something falling on you that's really nice and one of it's funny one of the one of the other things that don pettit and i had this conversation is like you know what i really miss is a sink like just to go someplace and put your hands under wash your hands and then wash your face those things you just miss versus just squirting water and then rubbing it on yourself you know so i don't know there's just different funny things like that that little get little triggers yeah you when you came back the first thing you ate was the veg grilled cheese sandwich oh yeah yeah absolutely because it reminded you of your father yes yes well it's funny i had that before i flew on my first flight for sure from my father and i was thinking about coming it coming back up again and i'm like oh this will be smooth it won't be hard to get if i throw up and when i came back to earth specifically this time over the last couple years my husband has started to make homemade bread and i couldn't think of a better thing to eat than a grilled cheese with his homemade bread it was like putting those two together so good what did it taste like did it remind you of your father oh yeah yeah remind me of my dad of course just just just because he ate grilled cheese all the time and just it was yummy because we didn't we don't have really good bread you know we have little teeny loaves of bread up there and tortillas and so having really good bread and having cheese which is all which is like a little bit of a luxury on space we get it every now and then but we don't have it on a regular basis up there we have some canned cheese on the russian side but just every now and then we get a specialty like a chunk of cheese but we don't really have cheese all the time you know you were you were close to your father right yeah yeah absolutely what do you miss about him the most i think i miss just going for a walk with him that's that was always nice i mean he was he was one of these types of people who could really go for a walk and observe everything around him and not that he's talking about it all the time but he might just stop you for a second and then tell you something and just you know just having a nice conversation with him you you you're so accomplished you've done so many things and somebody asked you about your father and you said that your accomplishments are relatively way easier than your father like your father is much more accomplished why did you say so oh i i absolutely believe that you know one you know he did a lot of those things his life accomplishments in his life on his own like just went out there and did it i feel like i've been sort of guided by having a military career and then you know not necessarily being told but like hey this is the opportunity or this is what you're supposed to be doing and so i'm just doing things and then then some advice from some friends like i mentioned about becoming an astronaut that's all just sort of it seemed like it was easy and it was piled on each other not necessarily easy i shouldn't say it that way but like it was obvious when things became obvious whereas my for my dad i think about somebody making the decision trying to make the decision what do i wanna do when i grow up i have to if i wanna go to school i have to have really good grades or i'm not gonna get in school you know i i wanna go to medical school it's was very com competitive it is very competitive here in india it's in competitive in the united states too but i i would say more so here yeah and and he didn't have his parents to help him or to guide him he just decided he was gonna do it and decided like this is how i have to live i i'm gonna go to boarding school i'm gonna go to medical school i'm gonna somehow figure out a way to come to the united states and practice medicine there and see how that is and decide whether or not i'm coming back or going and i mean i have my brother over there but that's it i don't know what this journey is gonna be like i mean for us we like get on a plane and we go someplace across around the globe or on a spacecraft and he had to get on a boat that whole experience and part of the reason he ate cheese was because the first time he ate cheese was on the ship that he was coming over here he didn't know what it was he was like what is this plasticky thing but he so so after that he liked cheese and then he ate grilled cheese because he didn't really know what to make and how to make stuff when he came to the united states right away until he got some friends and you know gathered with them and then was able to make some other food but grilled cheese was his go to cause it was easy he knew it was vegetarian it's good do you still measure your success against his no i just i just when people ask about it i just i think to myself like oh gosh don't make such a big deal about it because there's other people who have done some incredible things and had to plan it out do it all on their own and so that's why i i feel like his accomplishments were so much more brave and courageous than mine and you you don't take compliments well do you well i feel like i i i know myself right and i'm not extraordinary i'm just somebody who has put their head down and and done some stuff and has didn't take no for an answer but i'm not extraordinary and i say that just because i think there's many more young astronauts out there and i i they'll probably be doubting themselves at some points in time and that's okay but they can do it you know this is not an extraordinary feat wow you're extraordinary i don't know why you think that you're no one so you're you're extraordinary and i'm sure like ninety nine point nine nine percent people will feel about that oh gosh probably like point zero one percent somebody thinking otherwise no i i'm but i i feel i i mean i honestly feel this way like if i could do these things anybody could do these things i had a hard time in college you know and i there was subjects in high school that i still had hard times with you know like people are are they can do it we're smart i mean i think sometimes we just don't tap our potential yeah because you're talking about your father i always feel like like i like asking this question so i'll go ahead and ask you what do you wish your father would have seen in you before he left oh wow that's what i i remember him saying one time i'll just i don't know if i'm gonna answer your question exactly but i remember him saying i was after like my first flight or something maybe my second flight and we were talking about space and he goes he goes you know a lot about space and i said dad i know a lot about space because i live there like of course i know a lot about space i would say you know like i i grew up in needham massachusetts right i would say you know a lot about needham massachusetts we grew up there so like it's the same type of thing which is just sort of funny for me to have him say that which was and and then then we we had a good laugh about it but i think i you know it's funny i think after i became a a test pilot and an astronaut he was you know we were he wasn't doing his life i was doing my life after i graduated from college so i don't think he knew exactly and my mom either what i was doing they all came to my test pilot school graduation and i think it was it was enlightening for them to see all of the aircraft that we were flying and what we were doing because before that i was in the navy and i was deploying and going away and so i don't think it was tangible because it was so out of like the realm of what folks in my family were doing at that time like exactly what we're doing but when they saw all the different aircraft and helicopters and and heard a lot about that i think both of both of my parents at that point in time were a little surprised that i went down that path like they knew that was going on but they really didn't see it until that time because all the aircraft were there all my classmates were there and then as when i became an astronaut i think there was a little bit of the same thing it seems different from everything our family was doing so it's hard to really put your hands on it but when they all went to my first launch to see a space shuttle launch out of florida i think that like was like eye opening experience for everybody like wow this is this is serious we launch on rockets my sister said such a funny thing i called her once i got to the space station i said what was your impression mosi because i like to hear what people's impressions are like what was it like she goes oh my god it was nighttime launch too she goes oh my god there was so much fire and i said yeah that's what's at the bottom of rockets it's fire that's how they go you know and but it was it's funny because i think at that point in time people realized what this is all about and i think my father at the same time figured out like wow she's actually going to space and i i think he was the one who gave me the bhagavad gita he was the one who gave me the open issues on my second flight and i think he was just like you're you're you have a unique experience and stay grounded lit and live in the moment you you carry bhagavad gita and lord ganesh still with you right because your father gave it to you so does it still feel the same or does it feel different now like when you carry bhagavad gita with you now when you've now that your father is not with you yep yeah i mean it's a little a little piece of him is with it all of course i mean that's that's why i'm i'm indian right that's that's why that's because of him his i think a lot half at least half of my personality is because of him and and understanding of the universe around us is because of him what part of it feels different now since he's not here it's it seems like he's part of all of that which is sort of interesting thought process i didn't think about that before but like since he's not with us he's part of all of that that you feel and you study is in the universe he's not here just to be like next to me to tell me about the plants and the trees and the birds he's part of all of that nice and what specific trait you would say you inherited from your father is there any because you've said that you got your slovenian stubbornness from your mother oh yeah you've heard that yeah yeah yeah i think from my father i'm very lucky to be to have the ability to stop and just observe around me i like this one picture don pettit took of me in the cupola because and my friend tracy took one that was like this too it's it's nice to just have some moments of time not when you're taking a picture or trying to do something when you can just stop and look at what's going on around you i did not get that from my mom my mom is a very very very active maybe it's on a walk but maybe it's sometimes just hanging out did any part of you change after he's gone you know i miss him physically you know because it's always nice to just be able to talk to somebody but at the same time you know his passing was very peaceful and i feel like he was he was ready to go it's funny it was very interesting when he passed away we my sister and i were just coming in to see him and he just passed and he was i think he was just in a peaceful place because he was up and around maybe a half an hour before we were there i think he was just like it's my time to go to the next place and it'll be okay yeah so that made us feel okay too and you so when you carry lord ganesh with you you said like it's been your good luck charm it's been always there all around your house you always carry it with you do you see your father in that energy now with lord ganesh like not not as a person you know like it's funny like i was saying it's his it was his time to leave and and move on to the next thing right so as i see that as part of who i am because of him mhmm yeah but you don't feel like there's some invisibly he's watching you from somewhere oh absolutely i know i know he's watching yeah his his spark is there as he would say his spark is there watching me all the time yeah because we are talking about a father and lord ganesh and bhagavad gita i have to ask you the most obvious question is how does india look like from space yeah so india is sometimes tricky to get a picture of because it's a little bit hazy at times but sometimes it's awesome so it just depends on one the weather but there's now and i don't remember this from last slides like a trail to come to see india because there's fishing boats in the gulf of arabia off of the coast of india on the west side there's different parts of different fishing boat sections in the world but it's definitely on the west coast of india and it's so weird because i thought to myself how could these be fishing boats why how could i see a boat there's no way because like in the daytime sometimes you can't see the boat but you can see the wake because the wake goes on for miles but they must have amazing lights and for whatever reason if they're looking into the water or if they're trying to attract fish or whatever they're trying to do i don't know but you can see these big plots of fishing boats all over the place so that's new for nighttime and you can see that coming in and then at night which is india's pretty spectacular because the cities are lit up it's white lights and all those lights seems to be like connected so almost like when i see it i think of like nerves like pictures people have of when they like tell you like there's a nerve problem and these nerves are connected like all of these little connections india is like that it's like very connected with lights at night so that's that was one big impression this time that i didn't remember from last time last time more so looking at india in the daytime and the colors are amazing the himalayas are absolutely amazing and you can you can sort of see where it like i've said this before it feels like where the plates bumped up into each other and and made the you know made the mountains and then the coast is obviously cool because you can see particularly on the east side when the rivers run off how they interact with the water on that side the different colors and swirls from that side and then at one point in time i took a picture of the interaction between india and how do we call it nowadays sri lanka yeah and it seems like there's a connection there i'll just say that i'll say that i think i think that picture took there was a little bit of a discussion about that picture but it looks like there is they know they absolutely could be connected yeah there must be some there's something there there's something connected maybe leave it out there like that yeah yeah leave it at that and when you look out of the window okay this is my sci fi brain talking okay so just don't doubt me on this question but i'm still gonna be what's the strangest thing you've seen in the space which you think is going to be hard to believe for people here oh interesting two different things that were different or have been different there's a lot of communication satellites up there now star links and so you can this time from ten years ago they fly across the the view like you see the stars of course as they're coming but they fly across the view which is like woah where where did these all come from and there's which is great because there's a lot of communication now on earth because we have these constellations of satellites but there is it was an impression like there is a lot of stuff in orbits around the planet the other thing which was really cool this time and we were able it's hard to see with the naked eye but we have some really great cameras and we were able to take pictures not me in particular but don pettit and and matt dominic of blue jets and red sprites coming out of a thundercloud like energy coming up it's out there because nicole ayers took some after we left too and i think those are posted just amazing that we're able to take pictures of energy coming out of a thundercloud and out of lightning wow yeah that was pretty amazing so there's there's just and i had no idea those things existed people knew they were existing but it was hard to actually document it and now the cameras that we have we can we can document that so all of that is pretty pretty amazing don was able to also with his camera because these are things you can see you can see the milky way like it's amazing to see so many billions of stars out there but he was and it's hard to take a good pictures pinpoint pictures of stars because we're moving so fast mhmm he rigged up with a little gearbox something to copy the orbital rate as we were flying so he could pinpoint the pictures pinpoint the stars and then the lights on the earth were a little bit blurred that's backwards of how normal cameras or normal setups would would would do it so those pictures are out there also from don pettit if anybody gets a moment to take a look on the internet incredible pictures so i i had the luxury of being up there with some amazing photographers that were able to do that do you do you believe there's some life out there absolutely with those billions of stars out there you know we're just a little planet around one star so yeah there's life out there i mean there's life on earth in places we never thought they could be right at the bottom of the ocean with the thermal vents that are coming up there's light things that live without great pressure without light in the darkness so yes and strange gases that we found actually on our second spacewalk butch did some swabbing on the outside of the spacecraft there's microbes that live on the outside of the space space station yes they're probably from us because they're in the vicinity of where there's some gas vents whenever we vent overboard so sure they probably came from us because they're right there but what it proves to us is something can live in the vacuum of space with the heat heating and cooling so that's more you know you know with proof in the pudding that something could live out there even as close as the moons of jupiter mhmm thinking that one of them at least europa i think it is is has water on it be nice to drop a spacecraft over there and drop a rover through the ice and see what's going on and there's some plans to do that as well but if there's water there's probably something there's obviously you know evidence of water on the moon and on mars or some type of liquid right so there might be might have been something on mars at least that we could potentially go see if we go there so do you think there's some species around there there might be who knows who knows we have to go and see you believe in the possibility but you don't know yeah yeah no i mean i don't think it's humans for example but but there's some type of some forms of life potentially interesting but potentially i have i have like last two three questions for you yeah and one of them is tell me the most beautiful thing you've seen i i mean i really think the aurora and one of the really huge benefits of us being up there all of the summer of twenty four this year also in or last year in twenty five but we weren't there thankfully but in twenty four this summer we had some incredible aurora because of solar activity and such that the aurora came down usually you look out the window and you could see it over there like you're looking and you're like oh my god that's amazing look at it it's so great we're taking pictures out the side so you could sort of see the earth this time we flew essentially through the aurora it was low enough our orbit's fifty one point six degrees so it came down somewhere in that vicinity and it was amazing like not only like what you typically see of green lights but you also we also saw pinks and then some purple which means you know that was stronger and there was interacting with other elements in our in in the vicinity of our magnetic field so pretty impressive and humbling when you think about it first time i saw auroras on my first flight on a spacewalk and it was below me and i was like woah you know thinking like the energy that's out there in the universe is just incredible and something that we could we we worry about energy here on this planet all the time but there's more out there that we could never even think about harnessing so how do we how would we do that right it's amazing so that it was just mind boggling and incredible yeah interesting yeah before you set a foot on your first flight you saw what happened with kalpana chawla and then she's she was an incredible woman yes absolutely inspiration for all of us role model yes yeah like she was a she's a friend of yours she's a role model and you saw her death uh-huh did that event change anything you or the way you look at death and life because you were taking the same kind of path uh-huh she's a friend and she's a role model she's the first indian american woman to do all of these things and you're gonna be the next so did that change anything you about death i think the not about death but about the i think the desire to explore more i know that her and her crewmates you know that's what's in their heart i mean they were doing some really fundamental science to help us with the space station and understand how we do how the processes work so we could make do even more incredible experiments while we're up there and then continue this fact of us being able to live for longer in space and then how we can move on i mean i know i know all of them and a couple of them very well really good friends and not only kulpna but that was like what was in their hearts you know dave brown was a really good friend part probably one of the reasons i came to nasa was because i knew him a long time beforehand and he was one of those people who was like sonny this job is for you and so i knew in his heart i know in keltner's heart that this is what they wanted to do so i think it gave gave us even more of a feeling of like we really wanna continue this we've gotta do this in their memory and same with challenger and that's why we continue to fly the space shuttle after challenger like we can do this and we can do this better and we're gonna learn more about this we're not gonna let their you know situation put a stop on it they wouldn't want that so we're just gonna we're gonna press harder and we i think we all know that there's risks involved in this but we've learned so much from each misstep i would say we learned from challenger we learned of course we learned from apollo one first and foremost the russians have learned their a lot of things from soyuz issues as well we've learned from challenger we've learned from columbia we've learned from starliner i mean one of the like the i think the best things about starliner is some of those thrusters are on other spacecraft how do how do we now we need to understand a little bit more about this and make those spacecraft better and what are the questions we didn't ask and we can ask those questions for the next spacecraft that we're we're gonna fly so it didn't scare me it got me ready ready to go and and happy to explore in their name and so when you're strapping yourself in the rocket in that moment are you like super optimistic or you are going to the thought that you're prepared to die whatever happens we'll take care of it i think we're not super optimistic and not prepared to die prepared to die neither one of those things i think we're ready for i mean it was sort of like come on it's like a game right it's sort of like like at the beginning of a football match right and everybody's pumped up and they're ready to take on the responsibility of whatever action's gonna happen right they're ready i think that's how we felt at least you know butch and i getting into we're ready for this we're ready let's go we know we know what we can handle we know what we're supposed to do like let's just let's go bring it on there's no other thought yeah no no it's when you do those vr simulations right in that do you do you see yourself maybe never coming back or doing something or no you're like just never thought oh no like there's a it's hard for a change there's a vr thing that we do for this backpack that we have on on the back for our space box right that is to me scary because there's you know you have to practice a little bit to figure out how to fly or with the orbital mechanics to get yourself back to the space station and when you're learning this for me i wasn't a natural right from the get go i i figured it out and i have a plan but what so the first time i did it you know i think i missed the space station by like inches and you can't do anything because you're out of gas and like ah and you float away and that would be bad it leaves an impression on left an impression on me like you're just sitting here with goggles on and you're sweating because this is you're working trying to figure out how to solve this problem and nervous that you're going to float away such that there's just probably ninety nine point nine percent i'll never get myself in that situation i can't say one hundred percent but whenever i got to a worksite a tether down a second tether down okay now i can take my hands off like it left such an impression that you would really never wanna get yourself in that situation like i don't ever wanna have this happen to me never sure so the last question yep is what's one question you wish people would have asked you oh oh and so my biggest takeaway from this flight was really not there there's lots of technical things that we learned right like i just mentioned that we could pass on and make the next flight better or make make the hardware better ask the right questions maybe do the engineering process better right all of that is huge lessons learned but the biggest lesson learned is when i came back and again we could talk about the press and how maybe the narrative was blown out of proportion in my in my perspective but people would be like i'm so glad you came back people i don't know i don't know even what country they're from i don't know what nationality they are i don't know what ethnicity they are i don't know what religion i don't know what politics they are from all over the world we're like i'm so happy you're back you know welcome home thankfully we were praying for you we were thinking about you whatever you know and my overall lesson learned from this is like people are good people are nice and as human beings we we care about each other and it seems like that gets lost with a lot of distractions and noise that are going around and we just need to listen to each other because people are good does it get you overwhelmed when you talk about it it bums me out a little bit because i had to go through this process to see that and that's why i keep talking about it because i hope that other people don't have to go through a process i hope we would just stop and listen to each other and realize how good human beings are yeah i can see your eyes getting teared out yeah human beings care about each other and we forget that we fight over stupid things which is unfortunate well thank you so much for doing this yeah it was an honor to speak to you it was but it was incredibly good yeah thank you thank you so much for doing this thank you so much then thanks to your team you guys are very patient hello hi how are you hello raj hi raj it's sunny nice to meet you nice to meet you hi guys how are you we're we're honored to have you oh thank you so much i appreciate it what do you read what do you usually read i have read just mostly technical stuff more more recently last ten years of my life have sort of been all consumed by this flight so so that and and commercial crew so i haven't had a lot of just nice reading i'm reading a funny little book right now about i got it as a gift from slovenia about weird little slovenian things which is fun but i actually more so like what is it called like fictional history which book were you reading i'm i'm interested in this like about einstein mhmm and then there were some other other ones but i haven't read them for a little while but anyway i like reading about the people yeah thank you so much for watching this podcast till the end please let us know in the comments what all did we do right so that we can improve and keep doing that better and what all did we do wrong so that we never repeat it and at the same time please give us suggestions of who's the next guest that you want to see on the podcast and don't forget to share this episode with at least one person who will get some insights because one conversation is enough to give people enough ideas to change their lives i'll see you next time until then keep figuring out and also don't forget to subscribe the channel
