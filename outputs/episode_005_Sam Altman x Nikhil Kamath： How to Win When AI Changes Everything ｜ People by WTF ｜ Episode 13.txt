you told him five minutes like he has two minutes yeah two minutes everything looks good just the monitor the main monitor went off everyone who's done can leave hi sam hey nikhil how are you i'm good sorry i'm late i got caught up in getting ready for the launch tomorrow and lost track of time and excitement with the final results but no worries i'm guessing it must be really hectic right it is a very hectic day i have the model and i've been playing with it a little bit how is it different sam i'm not an expert at this so yeah there's all these ways we can talk about you know it's better at this metric or it's you know can do this amazing coding demo that you know gpt-four couldn't but the thing that has been most striking for me is in ways that are both big and small going back from gpt-five to our previous generation model is just so painful it's just like worse at everything and i've taken for granted that there's a fluency and a depth of intelligence with gpt five that we haven't had in any previous model it's an integrated model so you don't have to pick in our model switcher and know if you should use gpt four point zero or three point zero or four point zero four minutei or any of the complicated things it's just one thing that works and it is like having phd level experts in every field available to you twenty fourseven for whatever you need not only to ask anything but also to do anything for you so if you you know need a piece of software created you can kind of do it from scratch all at once if you need a if you need a research report on some complicated topic it can do that for you if you needed to you know plan an event for you it could do that too is it more agentic in nature in the sense that sequential tasking you're one one step closer to it because i was trying that it's much better at things like that the the sort of the robustness and reliability has greatly increased and that that's very helpful for agentic workflows so i i'm like very impressed by how long and complex of a task it can carry out so we did a call a couple of weeks ago when i was bugging you about what sectors and teams to invest in for the next decade so i don't want to talk about that too much i thought we'll keep today about first principles and how the world is changing by virtue of all that is changing in the world that you dominate so the very first thing i want to start with is if i were a twenty five year old boy or girl living in mumbai or bangalore in india i know you've said a bunch of times that colleges are not are not holding on to the place of relevance they might have had when i was growing up but what do i do now a what do i study if i'm starting a company what kind of company do i start or if i were to even find a job what industry do you think has some kind of tailwind i'm not talking ten years down the line but even as close as three to five years down the line first of all i think this is probably the most exciting time to be starting out one's career maybe ever i think like that twenty five year old in mumbai can probably do more than any previous twenty five year old in history could it's really amazing what you can do with a tool like this i felt the same way when i was twenty five and you know the tools then were not as amazing as tools we have now but we had the computer revolution and we could do things you know a twenty five year old then could do things that no twenty five year old in history before would have been able to and now that's happening in a huge way so whether you want to start a company or be a programmer or go work in kind of any other industry you know create new media whatever it is the ability for one person to use these tools and have great ideas and implement them with what would have taken you know decades of experience or teams of people is really quite remarkable in terms of particular industries i am very excited about what ai is going to mean for science and the amount of science that one person will be able to discover and the rate at which they can do that clearly it's transforming what it means to program computers in a huge way and people will be able to create completely new kinds of software in a huge new scale definitely for start ups you know if you have that idea for a new business the ability for a very tiny team to do a huge amount of work is great but it feels like this is just now a very open canvas you know people people are limited to a degree that they've never been before only by the quality and creativity of their ideas and you have these incredible tools to help you realize them is there anything in particular you want to say about gpt five then i can ask you questions around that gpt five does does feel to us like it's going to be another big step forward in how people use these systems the the level of capability the level of robustness the reliability and the ability to use this just for a lot of tasks in life to create software to answer questions to learn to work more efficiently like this is a you know pretty significant step forward each time we've had one of these we have been amazed by the potential it unlocks and in particular india is india is now our second largest market in the world it may become our largest we've taken a lot of feedback from users in india about what they'd like from us better support for languages more affordable access much more and we've been able to put that into this model and upgrades to chatchippity so we're committed to continuing to work on that but the you know every time we've had a major leap forward in how the capability we can bring to users we've been amazed by what those twenty five year olds go off and do in terms of creating new companies or you know learning better getting better medical advice or whatever else is there anything that i could build on top of g p t five today as a twenty five year old in india that you think are low hanging fruits per se that i should definitely look at i think you could build an entire startup way more efficiently than you ever could before now this is obviously i'm biased because this is like near and dear to my heart but the fact that as a twenty five year old in india or anywhere else maybe with a couple of friends maybe just by yourself you could use gpt five to help you write the software for a product much more efficiently help you handle customer support help you write marketing and communications plans help you review legal documents all of these things that would have taken a lot of people and a lot of expertise and you now have g p t five to help you do all all of this that that's pretty amazing if i could push you to be like a bit more specific and say i get science but what do i study say i've been studying engineering or commerce or arts or something like that is there any specific thing i study in order to use ai to develop something in science i think the most important specific thing to study is just getting really good at using the new ai tools i think learning is valuable for its own sake and learning to learn is this like meta skill that will serve you throughout life and whether you're learning engineering like computer engineering or biology or any other field like that if you get good at learning things you can learn new things quickly but fluency with the tools is you know is really important when i was in college or in high school it seemed to me that the obvious thing to do was learn to program and i didn't know exactly what i was going to use that for but there was this new frontier that seemed very high leverage and important to get good at and right now learning how to use ai tools is probably the most important specific hard skill to learn and the difference between people who are really good at it really ai native and think of everything in terms of those tools and don't is huge there's other general skills learning kind of like to be adaptable and resilient which i think is something really learnable that's like quite valuable in a world that's changing so fast learning how to figure out what people want is really quite important before this i used to be a start up investor and people would ask me what the most important thing for start up founders to figure out was and my predecessor paul graham had this answer that has always stuck with me for people to give to founders and it became the motto for y combinator which is make something people want and that sounds like such an easy instruction i have watched so many people try so hard to learn how to figure that out and fail and then i've watched many people work really hard to learn how to do that and get great at it over a career so that's something as well but you know in terms of the specifics like are you supposed to take the biology class or the physics class i don't think it matters right now and if i were to build on top of that and when you say learn to adapt and change and learn ai tools faster is there a path i'm just looking for a light that somebody could begin walking towards how does one get better at the ai tools that are available out there well one great thing to do gpt-five is quite good at helping to create small pieces of software very quickly and much better than any model that i've used and in the last few weeks i have surprised myself how much i've used it to create a piece of software to solve some little problem that i have in my life and you know it's been an interesting creative process because i'll ask it for a first draft i'll start using that and then i'll say hey with this feature it would be better or with this other thing i'd be able to do something differently or you know i have started using it and realized that with my workflow i really needed this and by putting more and more of the things that i have to do in this kind of a workflow that's been a very interesting way for me to learn how to use this you mentioned paul graham and i i was reading this letter or report he wrote in two thousand nine where he spoke about five founders to watch out for and i think you were nineteen at the time and he mentioned you along with people like steve jobs and larry and sergei why was that you hadn't accomplished anything of note like they had what did paul see you see in you and what do you think is the innate skill set that sets you apart from your peers that was very nice of him i remember that i certainly i remember the time feeling that it was very deeply undeserved but grateful that he said that i mean there's like a lot of people who are starting great companies we got lucky here in many ways we've also worked super hard maybe the one thing that i would that i think we have done here well is to take a very long time horizon and think very independently you know when we started it was like four and a half years before we had our first product and it was very uncertain we were just doing research trying to figure out how to get ai to work and we had very different ideas than the rest of the world but i think that ability to sort of trust our own conviction over a long time horizon without a lot of external feedback was very helpful is that a v or a i thing because i'm speaking about when you were nineteen oh sorry i thought you were asking about openai me when i was nineteen i barely remember that i don't know i was like a naive nineteen year old that didn't really know what he was doing and this is not false modesty my own self i think i've done impressive things now but my own self conception in nineteen was like deeply unsure of myself and very unimpressive if the world were to be the world of tomorrow were to be a ai kingdom of sorts you're definitely some kind of prince and i don't know if you follow markievalli but he used to say a very interesting thing he said that a prince should always appear appear but not be religious compassionate trustworthy humane and honest do you think this particular projection of i've heard you i've watched a lot of your interviews of late and i've heard you say repeatedly that you're not formidable and use words like that this projection of humility is it apt for the world we live in or the world you're walking into i'm not sure it's apt for either one but when i was nineteen to go back to what you said i assumed that the people running these big tech companies really had it all figured out and there were you know adults in the room and somebody had a plan and there were these people that were like way different than me that understood how to do things and you know had this like the companies were like running very well and there was like not much drama and everything was like you know just everything was being handled by the adults and now that i'm supposed to be the adult in the room i will tell you i think no one has a plan no one really has it all working smoothly everyone or at least i am figuring out as they go and you know you have things you want to build and then things go wrong and you bet on the wrong people or the right people and you get a technological breakthrough here or you don't there and you just keep putting one foot in front of another and you put your head down and work and you you know you have these like tactics that some of them become great strategies some of them don't you try something and the market reacts in some way or your competitors react in some way and you do something else and now my conception is everybody is kind of figuring it out as they go everybody is like learning on the job and i don't think that's like false humility i think that's just the way the world works and it's like a little it's a little strange to be on this side of it but that is what it seems like i'm not even speaking so much about the authenticity of the humility or not but more again from the lens of somebody starting to build for tomorrow because that's who we speak to is that a good image to project into the world does it the image of humility really work today you mean should someone project that image yeah i mean i certainly have a very negative reaction to people who are projecting certainty and confidence when they don't really know what's going to happen and the reason is not just because it's annoying which it is but also because i think if you have that kind of a mindset it is harder to have the culture of intellectual openness and to sort of like listen to other viewpoints and make good decisions a thing i say all the time to people is no one knows what happens next and the more you forget that and the more you're like i am smarter than everybody else i have a master plan i'm not going to pay attention to like what my users are saying or where the technology takes us or how the world is reacting but you know i know better and the world doesn't know as much i think you just make worse decisions so having that kind of open mindset and the sort of like curiosity and willingness to adapt to new data and change your mind i think that's super important like the number of times we have thought we knew something to get smacked in the face by reality here has been a lot and one of our strengths as a company is when that happens we change what we're going to do that's been i think that's been really great and a big part of what's helped us succeed so maybe there are other ways to succeed and maybe you know projecting a ton of bravado into the world works but the best founders that i have watched up close throughout my career have all been more like the sort of quick learning and adapting style and you probably know more about this than most because of your role at y combinator i have a lot of data points on it at least yeah yeah when we met in washington a couple of years a couple of years ago at the white house i remember when we were speaking and you went somewhere i was speaking to your partner and you guys had a kid we did and how is that it is my favorite thing ever but i mean i know that like i have nothing that is not a cliche to say here mhmm but it is the coolest most amazing most like emotionally overwhelming in the best ways and hard ways to experience everything everyone said about how great it is how intense it is how it's like a kind of love you didn't know you could feel it's all true i have nothing to add other than i strongly recommend it and i think it's been really wonderful it's amazing so i ponder on this a lot sam kids why people have kids and also questions like what happens to religion and marriage tomorrow can i ask you why you had a kid like family has always been an incredibly important thing to me and going like it just it felt like it felt like the most and i didn't even know how much i underestimated what it was actually going to be like but it felt like the most important and meaningful and fulfilling thing i could imagine doing and it has so far so early exceeded all expectations do you think it's the biological need to procreate i don't know there's like it this seems like a thing that is so deep it's difficult to put into words but i feel confident like everyone i know looking back on their life who has had a great career and had a family has either said you know i'm so glad i took the time to have kids that was one of the most important things i've ever done the best things i've ever done or they've said that was by far the best thing i've ever done that was way more important than any of the work i ever did and i was like willing to take the leap of faith that that would be true for me too and it certainly seems like it will be it's like yeah it is and if it is just a biological hack i don't care i'm so happy but it you know like there's a sense of responsibility and kind of like family is the word that keeps coming to mind that is just really great the world seems to be having lesser kids and do you have an insight into the future of marriage religion and kids yeah i hope that creating family creating community whatever you want to call it will become far more important in a sort of post agi world i think it's a real problem for society that those things have been in retreat i think that that just feels strictly bad to me i have i don't i'm obviously not sure why that's been happening but i hope we'll really reverse course on that and in a world where people have more abundance more time more sort of resources and potential and ability i think it's like pretty clear that family and community are two of the things that make us the happiest and i hope we will turn back to that as societies get more affluent if one were to buy into the mimetic desires of people we all tend to want what other people want not necessarily what other people have if we all had more do you think we would still want more if we all had enough i i do sort of think that human demand desire ability to play status games whatever it seems pretty limitless and i don't think that's necessarily bad or not all bad but yeah i think we will figure out new things to want and new things to compete over do you think the world retains largely the world retains the current model of capitalism and democracy in a way let me give you a scenario what happens if a company x let's say openai gets to the point where it is fifty percent of world gdp does society allow for that or i would bet not i don't think that will happen i think this will be a much more distributed thing but if for some reason that did happen i think society would say we don't think so like let's figure out something to do here the analogy i like most for ai is the transistor which was this really important scientific discovery that for a while looked like it was going to capture a ton of the value and then turned out to be something that just gets built into like tons of products and services and you don't really think about you know the fact that you're using transistors all day long it's just kind of in everything and all these companies make incredible products and profits from it in this very distributed way so i would guess that's what happens and it's not like one company is ever half of global gdp at one point i did worry that that might happen but i think that was a naive take right but do you think the odds of the world moving towards socialism go up or if something gets that large will it get nationalized and we become more socialist i don't know if something will get nationalized i don't know if the world will like officially turn towards socialism but i expect that i expect that like social support or redistribution or whatever you want to call it will increase over time as society gets richer and as sort of the technological landscape shifts i don't know what way it's going to happen and i expect in different countries it will happen in different ways like i think you'll see experimentation of like new kinds of sovereign wealth funds new kinds of like universal basic income ideas redistribution of ai compute i don't know exactly what but i suspect we'll see a lot of experimentation in society here on universal basic income i think worldcoin was a very interesting experiment can you tell us a bit about what's happening there the idea was could we you know we have all this ai coming we really want to like care about humans as special can we find a way to a privacy preserving way to identify unique humans and then create a new network and a new currency around that so it's a very interesting experiment still early but growing quite fast if agi eliminates scarcity a scarcity by virtue of increasing productivity could one also assume that it would be deflationary in nature capital or money loses its ability to return a rate of return and capital no longer remains a moat in the world of tomorrow i feel confused about this i think if you like look at the basic economic principles it's supposed to be hugely deflationary and yet if the world decides that you know building out ai compute today is super important to things tomorrow maybe something very strange happens with the economy and maybe capital is really really important because every piece of compute is so valuable i was asking someone at dinner the other night if they thought that interest rates should be minus two percent or twenty five percent and he kind of laughed he's like well that's a ridiculous question it has to be and then he stopped and said actually i'm not sure so i think it's like yeah it should be deflationary eventually but i could see it being weird in the short term that's actually a very interesting thing to say do you suspect it would be minus two percent eventually right but i'm not sure and maybe it's just like we're in this massive expansionary time where you're trying to like build the dyson sphere in the solar system and you're borrowing money at crazy rates to do that and then there's more expansion beyond it more and more and i don't know like i find it very hard to see more than a few years in the future at this point the conversation we were having a couple of weeks ago i was doing more research on the sectors you had suggested i think we agreed on older and sicker world you also made a case for as discretionary spend goes up gateway luxury brands might do well yeah what happens to them in a deflationary world because the value of these purchases go down maybe not i mean deflate in a deflationary world some things can face huge deflationary pressure and others can be the sink for all of the extra capital so i'm actually not sure they do go down in a deflationary world you know i would bet they go up actually yep i think so because the extra the excess capital has to flow somewhere when you look at classical economic theory like adam smith and stuff like that the austrian school always spoke about the marginal utility of things if you have one kettle at home to make tea it has x in value when you have two kettles it still has some value but when you have twenty kettles it has no value do do you think the world goes in that direction yeah so twenty kettles doesn't help you but even if you're only going to you know spend two hours a day playing video games or whatever and that amount of time is fixed and and so you don't need twenty hours worth of video games if that two hours of games gets better and more entertaining forever and ever and ever and just keeps getting more and more compelling that still has value to you and i think there are a lot of categories where we will find that people can just get much better stuff even if they don't necessarily get more of them i think we'll see this in a really big way do you think there's a use case for the rappers that are getting built on these large models right now like i was in the us recently and i met harvey for example what happens to a rapper like that does it get innovated out by the model itself at some point of time some of them yes and some of them no and it's you know it's like sometimes you can obviously predict when one is going to go one way or the other and sometimes it really depends on the choices the company makes down down the line the main thing i would say is using ai itself does not create a defensible business you see this with every technology boom where people are like well i'm a start up doing x and because i'm using the latest technology trend the normal rules of business don't apply to me and that's never true you've always got to like parlay that advantage that comes from using the new technology into a durable business with real value that gets created and it's kind of a race against the clock to do that so you know you can definitely build an amazing thing with ai but then you have to go build a real defensible layer around it if i were to build a business on top of your model let me give you the example of amazon for example if i sold a certain kind of t shirt and i sold a lot and amazon had all the data eventually amazon probably started a white labeled brand which was very similar to mine and cannibalized my business almost should one worry that will happen here as well because you're no longer just a model but you're foraying into so many different businesses i'd come back to that example of the transistor the you know we are building this general purpose technology that you can integrate into something in a lot of ways but we keep following our equivalent of moore's law and the general capability keeps going up if you build a business that gets better the business gets better when the model gets better then you should keep doing you should keep doing well if we continue to make progress if you build a business where when the model gets better your business gets worse because the wrapper was too thin or whatever then that's probably bad in the same way that it's been bad in other technology revolutions so there are clearly companies building on top of ai models that are creating huge value and very deep relationships with their customers for themselves cursor is like a recent example of a company that is just exploding in popularity and i think really durable relationships with their customers and then there's many others that don't and that's kind of that's always the case it does seem to me like there are more companies getting created now than in previous technological revolutions that feel like they have a chance at real durability maybe an example we could use to ground this is when the iphone first came out and the app store first came out the first set of apps were pretty light and a lot of them ended up being features that kind of made it into future versions of ios you know you could like sell a flashlight for a dollar that turned on the flash on your phone and you made a lot of dollars doing that but it wasn't sticky because eventually apple just added that into the operating system where it belonged but if you started something that was like complicated and the iphone was just an enabler for it like uber that was a very valuable long term thing to do and in the early days like the gpt three days i think you had a lot of kind of toy applications as you should many of which didn't need to be stand alone companies or products but now as the market's matured you're really seeing some of these more durable businesses form so if you lay emphasis on owning the customer almost like the interface with the customer would you say the relationship gets deeper when i sell a service on top of your model versus a product because if it's a product company the the exchange happens once but if it's a service company it happens repeatedly and there is room for me to build and taste in that transaction which is repetitive in nature yeah gen generally i agree with that a small part of my world or a part of my world is creating content which i do once a month if a model to a large extent is able to factor in my vintage my tenure and my evolution and throughout an output which is predictive in nature with a fair degree of fair fair degree of efficiency now if i behave in the same predictable manner tomorrow will be less valuable than me being contrarian contradian not to the world but contrarian to my own behavior almost so do you think the world inordinately favors contrarian behavior tomorrow yeah that's a good point i think so i think the thing i'm thinking is how much will the models learn to do that you know you want to be contrarian and right most of the time you're contrarian you're contrarian and wrong and that's not that helpful but but yeah i bet the ability to come up with the kind of contrarian and right idea that the models today just can't do at all and maybe they'll get better at at some point that value of that should go up over time getting good at doing things models can't do seems like an obvious increase in value outside of being contrarian is there anything else that i could do that a model will take longer to learn look the models are going to be much smarter than we are but there's a lot of things that people care about that have nothing to do with intelligence maybe there can be like an ai podcast host that is much better than you at asking interesting questions and you know kind of engaging whatever and i personally don't think that podcast host that ai podcast host is likely to be more popular than you people really care about other humans this is like very deep people want to know a little bit about your life story what got you here they want to be able to like talk to other people about this shared sense of who you are and there's like some cultural and social value in that we are obsessed with other people and why is that sam why do you think that is that you know like i think that's also like deepened in our biology and you know again the earlier comment you don't fight things that are deep in biology i think i make a ton of sense of why we would evolve that way but you know here we are so you know we're going to keep caring about real people and even if the ai podcast host is much smarter than you i think it's very unlikely he'll be more popular than you so in a perverse way being stupider will be more novel than being smart i don't know if it's like stupider or smarter that has the novelty but i think being a real person in a world of unlimited ai content will increase in value is a real person somebody who screws up unlike a model i mean certainly real people do screw up so maybe that's part of what we associate with a real person i'm not sure but i do think we just knowing that it's a real person or not we really extremely care about what is the difference between agi and human intelligence today and tomorrow so so like with gpt five you have something that is incredibly smart in a lot of domains at tasks that take you know seconds to a few minutes it's very superhuman at knowledge at pattern recognition at recall on these shorter term tasks but in terms of figuring out what questions to ask or to work on something over a very long period of time we are definitely not close to human performance and an interesting example that one of our researchers gave me recently is if you look at our performance in math you know a couple of years ago we could solve math problems that would take like an expert human a few minutes to solve recently we got gold level performance on the international math olympiad each of those problems takes about an hour and a half so we've gone from a problem a thinking horizon of a few minutes to an hour and a half to prove a new an important new mathematical theorem maybe takes like a thousand hours and you can predict when we can do a thousand hour problem but certainly in the world today we cannot at all and so that's like another dimension where ai can't do it so i was in the us between sf between san francisco and new york the last couple of months and i met a whole bunch of ai founders the one thing everybody seemed to agree on is like for ai the us is a few years ahead of most others they also thought that for robotics china seems to be ahead do you have a view on robotics and what happens there like humanoid or other form of robotics i think it will be incredibly important in couple of years i think one of the things that is going to feel most agi like is seeing robots just walk by you on the street doing kind of normal day to day tasks is there a reason why they need to have human like form well you can certainly have non humanoid forms but the world is really built for humans you know like door handles steering wheels in cars factories like a lot of this is built for we built it for our own kind of morphology so there will of course be other specialized robots too but the world like is built and i hope stays built for us you know robots that match that form factor it seems like a good idea if i'm a young guy looking to start a robotics company but somebody else has manufacturing scale and i really want as a indian guy to be able to build and compete there how do i make up for manufacturing scale as someone starting up well eventually once you build enough robots they can make more copies of themselves and but in the short term i think you probably have to find some really good partners that know a lot about manufacturing and you know we're interested in robots so we're thinking about this it's definitely a new skill for us to learn sam what happens to the form factor i've been using the cell phone for a long time i know you will not likely speak about what you're doing with jony ive and what happens there or maybe you will but what happens to form factor overall one of the things that i think will be defining about the difference of ai versus the sort of previous way we've been using computers and technology is you really want ai to be have as much context as possible do stuff for you and be proactive so a computer or a phone you know it's kind of either on or off it's in your pocket or it's in your hand and you're using it but you might want ai to just be you know like a companion with you throughout your day and alerting you in different ways when it can do something to help you or when it's you know there's something really important you need to know or reminding you of something that you said you needed to do earlier in the day and the current form factors of computers are i think not quite right for that they do have this either on or off binary that i think isn't quite what we want for like a the sort of sci fi dream of the ai companion so the form factor that enables that you could imagine a lot of things there's people talking about glasses and wearables and little things that sit on your table and i think the world will experiment with a lot of those but this idea of sort of ambiently aware physical hardware that feels like it's going to be important is that the form factor with johnny ive like a sensor so we'll try multiple products but but i think this idea of trying to build hardware that an ai companion can sort of embody itself in will be an important thread right the the last two things i want to ask you sam is one about fusion because i know you've invested in helion and you're a big proponent of it does that solve the climate change problem would you put money on that well it certainly helps a lot i suspect that we've already done sufficient damage to the climate we're gonna have to undo some damage too even if we got to switch to fusion right away but it would certainly be a great step forward and the last question i have for you sam is the question i care most about what's in this ai realm for india as a country what's the opportunity for us as i mentioned earlier i think india may be our largest market in the world at some point in the not very distant future the excitement the embrace of ai in india and the ability to for indian people to use ai to just sort of leapfrog into the future and invent a totally new and better way of doing things and the sort of economic benefits that come from that the societal benefits if there is one large society in the world that seems most enthusiastic to transform with ai right now it's india and the energy is incredible i'm looking forward to it coming soon and it's really like quite amazing to watch and i i think the it's sort of the momentum is
