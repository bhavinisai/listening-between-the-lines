[00:00:00.034 - 00:00:06.144] Speaker 1: When you come from an ordinary family, do you feel there is a need to prove yourself in the world?
[00:00:06.164 - 00:00:11.713] Speaker 2: In our ordinary families, why do women hesitate when they see men breaking?
[00:00:11.733 - 00:00:13.736] Speaker 2: Because we are raised with that mentality.
[00:00:13.756 - 00:00:17.042] Speaker 2: Father, husband, they can't break.
[00:00:17.062 - 00:00:20.948] Speaker 2: Even if the men in my house come to the point of breaking, they say, call Shruti.
[00:00:20.968 - 00:00:22.290] Speaker 2: I don't want to be that.
[00:00:23.138 - 00:00:26.071] Speaker 1: Do you think that if you are a powerful woman, there is more criticism?
[00:00:26.092 - 00:00:28.282] Speaker 2: If you are free, then that will be the problem.
[00:00:28.462 - 00:00:32.722] Speaker 2: Those who have never met offline, they have an online opinion.
[00:00:33.250 - 00:00:53.717] Speaker 1: What is it like to be the inner circle of top leadership in the country?
[00:00:53.737 - 00:00:55.139] Speaker 2: There is no inner circle.
[00:00:55.159 - 00:00:56.341] Speaker 2: PM Modi is the circle.
[00:00:56.481 - 00:00:57.202] Speaker 2: That's it.
[00:00:59.618 - 00:01:01.741] Speaker 1: I saw some clip where you got a little angry.
[00:01:01.962 - 00:01:05.847] Speaker 2: There's a speech of mine that goes viral of shouting at Sonia Gandhi.
[00:01:06.368 - 00:01:15.743] Speaker 2: Apologize to the nation.
[00:01:15.763 - 00:01:17.024] Speaker 2: My father had a stroke.
[00:01:17.225 - 00:01:20.690] Speaker 2: I know what I've lived in that one hour fifteen minutes.
[00:01:21.090 - 00:01:22.752] Speaker 1: When you lost the election, you felt nothing.
[00:01:22.772 - 00:01:24.033] Speaker 2: Because I've lost elections before.
[00:01:24.193 - 00:01:26.936] Speaker 2: I was smiling and I was saying, Jo, what happened was good.
[00:01:27.036 - 00:01:30.359] Speaker 2: Imagine, if I had won the 2004 election... Would you enjoy acting again?
[00:01:30.379 - 00:01:33.942] Speaker 2: A journalist asked me, why are you doing sadhvik vibhati?
[00:01:34.202 - 00:01:34.743] Speaker 2: It's my wish.
[00:01:34.983 - 00:01:37.606] Speaker 2: Earlier, they used to say, why did you make the actor the minister?
[00:01:37.626 - 00:01:39.207] Speaker 2: Now you're saying, why didn't you make Shruti Irani the minister?
[00:01:39.648 - 00:01:40.589] Speaker 1: Will you tell me your weakness?
[00:01:42.791 - 00:01:49.137] Speaker 1: What hurts more as an actor when somebody underestimates you or as a politician when you get hate more?
[00:01:50.017 - 00:01:50.578] Speaker 1: Umm...

[00:02:13.044 - 00:02:13.805] Speaker 1: What hurts more?
[00:02:14.385 - 00:02:21.973] Speaker 1: Being as an actor when somebody underestimates you, that hurts more or as a politician when you get hate more?
[00:02:22.573 - 00:02:23.314] Speaker 2: No, nothing.
[00:02:23.554 - 00:02:24.375] Speaker 2: I think that's me.
[00:02:24.395 - 00:02:26.657] Speaker 2: It's a good thing when people underestimate you.
[00:02:26.717 - 00:02:27.598] Speaker 2: They don't see you coming.
[00:02:27.898 - 00:02:31.081] Speaker 2: If you still have that, it's a good thing.
[00:02:32.402 - 00:02:42.792] Speaker 2: You should use any negativity that normally people do not know how to deal with as an instrument towards success.
[00:02:43.393 - 00:02:44.033] Speaker 2: But sometimes like this?
[00:02:44.053 - 00:02:46.616] Speaker 2: You cannot get so bogged down.
[00:02:47.797 - 00:02:53.522] Speaker 2: Because the world, see, I, because you are also from a normal family.
[00:02:53.794 - 00:02:59.702] Speaker 2: I always used to think that in politics, you say dynasty, in media, you say nippo babies.
[00:02:59.722 - 00:03:04.189] Speaker 2: Either I would get trapped in that circle and become a victim.
[00:03:04.209 - 00:03:09.736] Speaker 2: Or by analyzing them, I would improve myself as a functioning professional.
[00:03:10.778 - 00:03:18.589] Speaker 2: It was very clear that neither in media nor in politics, I would rely on how I made a network.
[00:03:19.270 - 00:03:22.194] Speaker 2: This was me when I was 24-25.
[00:03:22.370 - 00:03:27.735] Speaker 2: When I'm 49, I realize the potential of networks.
[00:03:27.755 - 00:03:33.020] Speaker 2: But networks also get with you to three burdens or disadvantages.
[00:03:34.141 - 00:03:36.543] Speaker 2: So you should be analytical in everything.
[00:03:36.784 - 00:03:41.628] Speaker 2: And analysis can't happen when you are emotionally ingrained in something.
[00:03:43.030 - 00:03:46.113] Speaker 1: So explain network and explain the advantages of it.
[00:03:46.133 - 00:03:47.534] Speaker 2: There are two or three things.
[00:03:47.554 - 00:03:51.858] Speaker 2: I always felt that when you go to study in an Ivy League school,
[00:03:52.578 - 00:03:59.646] Speaker 2: Because today, educational learning has been democratized.
[00:03:59.666 - 00:04:02.589] Speaker 2: Whatever you want to study, you can watch it on YouTube.
[00:04:02.629 - 00:04:03.711] Speaker 2: You can search it on Google.
[00:04:03.731 - 00:04:05.633] Speaker 2: You will find it on Google research.
[00:04:05.653 - 00:04:12.541] Speaker 2: In Berkeley, my first speaker was the one who established the Fintech school.
[00:04:12.981 - 00:04:14.463] Speaker 2: He is a professor.
[00:04:15.043 - 00:04:17.426] Speaker 2: They are also ordinary families.
[00:04:17.506 - 00:04:20.351] Speaker 2: So when I physically went to Berklee, I studied with them digitally.
[00:04:21.332 - 00:04:23.556] Speaker 2: And when I was studying, I was in the cabinet.
[00:04:23.616 - 00:04:30.487] Speaker 2: So it was very strange for Yanniv that a cabinet minister was sitting and reading Fintech.
[00:04:30.507 - 00:04:33.693] Speaker 2: And I didn't have anything related to Fintech.
[00:04:33.713 - 00:04:39.442] Speaker 2: So when I met Yanniv face to face, Yanniv and I exchanged notes.
[00:04:39.586 - 00:04:41.428] Speaker 2: It does not matter what your language is.
[00:04:41.689 - 00:04:43.491] Speaker 2: It does not matter what your geography is.
[00:04:44.112 - 00:04:47.957] Speaker 2: Sometimes coming from simple backgrounds in itself is a chip on the shoulder.
[00:04:48.838 - 00:04:51.361] Speaker 2: Which is agnostic to your culture.
[00:04:52.443 - 00:04:57.850] Speaker 2: That we have come from the earth, from the trenches, we have to go up.
[00:04:57.870 - 00:05:01.755] Speaker 2: So then I realized that when we were exchanging notes, the power of networks.
[00:05:01.775 - 00:05:07.442] Speaker 2: So whether it is an Ivy League school or an international think tank, what does it give you?
[00:05:07.906 - 00:05:10.869] Speaker 2: It gives a foundation to build relationships.
[00:05:11.489 - 00:05:13.672] Speaker 2: So I think that is what networks get you.
[00:05:14.472 - 00:05:16.715] Speaker 2: Access to places.
[00:05:17.215 - 00:05:18.516] Speaker 2: Access to information.
[00:05:19.998 - 00:05:20.899] Speaker 2: And new information.
[00:05:22.320 - 00:05:25.103] Speaker 2: Many people commercialize it.
[00:05:25.123 - 00:05:26.824] Speaker 2: It has no commercial value for me.
[00:05:27.085 - 00:05:33.751] Speaker 2: Just the whole journey of knowing in itself is brilliant.
[00:05:35.232 - 00:05:36.914] Speaker 2: Because we spend our whole life
[00:05:37.122 - 00:05:42.768] Speaker 2: Now see, our parents have said that we should get a good job.
[00:05:42.788 - 00:05:43.408] Speaker 2: Parents are scared.
[00:05:43.428 - 00:05:46.191] Speaker 2: They don't want you to do what they had to struggle for.
[00:05:47.272 - 00:05:56.461] Speaker 2: Any parent, I mean mostly parent, they don't refuse you because they are jealous of you.
[00:05:56.481 - 00:06:00.465] Speaker 2: They are just scared of you.
[00:06:00.505 - 00:06:03.648] Speaker 2: They tell you that I have struggled, you shouldn't struggle.
[00:06:03.668 - 00:06:05.330] Speaker 2: I have taught you.
[00:06:05.666 - 00:06:13.055] Speaker 2: Because they are taught that if you are educated in a good school, in a good college, it means 50% guarantee of success.
[00:06:13.335 - 00:06:13.595] Unknown: True.
[00:06:13.695 - 00:06:13.976] Speaker 2: Right?
[00:06:15.938 - 00:06:18.641] Speaker 2: Your whole life gets stuck between paycheck and pension.
[00:06:18.701 - 00:06:26.150] Speaker 2: And when the reality of your pension is formed, then you feel, I wish I had done this.
[00:06:26.170 - 00:06:30.535] Speaker 2: I didn't want to do that.
[00:06:30.555 - 00:06:33.138] Speaker 2: I knew that paycheck is important, I am not a fool.
[00:06:33.538 - 00:06:39.727] Speaker 2: I know that pension is important, I have arranged for it.
[00:06:40.248 - 00:06:43.814] Speaker 2: But at that age, I didn't want to regret.
[00:06:44.274 - 00:06:49.202] Speaker 1: But you mentioned 3-4 times that you are a chip on the shoulder from a normal family.
[00:06:49.282 - 00:06:57.675] Speaker 1: Do you think when you come from a normal family and your ambitions increase and you don't want to live paycheck to pension, these are all thoughts.
[00:06:58.476 - 00:07:02.482] Speaker 1: Do you feel there is a constant need to prove yourself in the world?
[00:07:03.266 - 00:07:04.428] Speaker 1: That is called chip on the shoulder.
[00:07:04.468 - 00:07:06.331] Speaker 1: That I have to prove myself.
[00:07:06.351 - 00:07:10.297] Speaker 2: Even when the world is not testing you, you are still testing yourself.
[00:07:10.317 - 00:07:13.962] Speaker 2: That is called chip on the shoulder.
[00:07:13.982 - 00:07:15.404] Speaker 1: So you felt the need to prove yourself?
[00:07:16.246 - 00:07:18.008] Speaker 2: Didn't feel the need to prove myself.
[00:07:18.229 - 00:07:22.796] Speaker 2: I think what takes a lot of people back is the tenacity.
[00:07:25.139 - 00:07:25.800] Speaker 2: How dare you?
[00:07:26.822 - 00:07:28.484] Speaker 2: How can you do it?
[00:07:28.564 - 00:07:29.466] Speaker 2: No, not that.
[00:07:29.486 - 00:07:32.210] Speaker 2: You can't be humble.
[00:07:33.058 - 00:07:35.580] Speaker 2: That is the other thing the rich teach their kids.
[00:07:36.782 - 00:07:38.984] Speaker 2: Which middle class, low middle class doesn't teach.
[00:07:40.265 - 00:07:43.148] Speaker 2: Whatever is listening to us today.
[00:07:43.428 - 00:07:46.571] Speaker 2: Your parents must have taught you this always.
[00:07:46.591 - 00:07:48.453] Speaker 2: Be loyal to your work.
[00:07:48.473 - 00:07:51.316] Speaker 2: Be loyal to the one who gave you a job.
[00:07:51.336 - 00:07:54.238] Speaker 2: Bow your head and work hard.
[00:07:54.338 - 00:07:58.122] Speaker 2: Your parents must have taught you that you should have a house.
[00:07:58.142 - 00:08:00.324] Speaker 2: You should have a good bank balance.
[00:08:00.965 - 00:08:01.726] Speaker 2: Put money in FD.
[00:08:01.746 - 00:08:02.226] Speaker 2: Did they teach you?
[00:08:02.306 - 00:08:03.527] Speaker 1: This is all taught.
[00:08:03.547 - 00:08:03.667] Speaker 2: Right?
[00:08:03.687 - 00:08:06.110] Speaker 2: The car should be in good condition, don't show off.
[00:08:06.130 - 00:08:09.673] Speaker 2: This is what your parents have taught.
[00:08:09.693 - 00:08:11.315] Speaker 2: What do rich people teach their children?
[00:08:12.696 - 00:08:16.420] Speaker 2: Strategize, move forward in whichever position you are in.
[00:08:18.903 - 00:08:23.767] Speaker 2: It is not necessary that you have to shift for 12 hours to move forward.
[00:08:23.787 - 00:08:25.269] Speaker 2: What does the boss like?
[00:08:25.289 - 00:08:27.651] Speaker 2: We all have to see this in the office.
[00:08:28.392 - 00:08:30.354] Speaker 2: There is someone who is less competent than you.
[00:08:30.722 - 00:08:33.307] Speaker 2: who is not so intelligent.
[00:08:33.327 - 00:08:38.055] Speaker 2: I have not learnt how to handle the Chakra even today.
[00:08:38.876 - 00:08:41.140] Speaker 2: Who will go to 10 people who are actually working.
[00:08:41.801 - 00:08:43.284] Speaker 2: Hear everything that they are doing.
[00:08:43.825 - 00:08:47.772] Speaker 2: Go to the boss before the hard worker gets to the boss.
[00:08:47.812 - 00:08:49.455] Speaker 2: You know what, I think this should happen.
[00:08:49.936 - 00:08:52.120] Speaker 2: You are doing it.
[00:08:52.380 - 00:08:55.826] Speaker 2: I think the middle class never teaches.
[00:08:56.034 - 00:08:59.898] Speaker 2: That is the one burden most middle class people are bogged down with.
[00:09:00.119 - 00:09:01.060] Speaker 1: How to serve the master.
[00:09:03.122 - 00:09:03.202] Unknown: Yes.
[00:09:03.222 - 00:09:07.927] Speaker 2: Because we were supposed to be taught to be humble, loyal, hardworking.
[00:09:09.269 - 00:09:13.013] Speaker 2: And Chakram has been taught by his parents.
[00:09:13.033 - 00:09:14.895] Speaker 2: How to leverage, how to be flashy.
[00:09:15.736 - 00:09:18.058] Speaker 2: Our parents have taught us not to be flashy.
[00:09:18.839 - 00:09:19.920] Speaker 1: Sit inside secretly.
[00:09:19.940 - 00:09:20.521] Speaker 2: Sit quietly.
[00:09:21.402 - 00:09:22.443] Speaker 2: They still say that.
[00:09:22.483 - 00:09:23.685] Speaker 2: They still say that.
[00:09:23.705 - 00:09:24.946] Speaker 2: That is the chip on the shoulder.
[00:09:25.858 - 00:09:31.527] Speaker 1: But ever because of this chip on the shoulder, I felt that if the world would have thought me less, then I would have... Never.

[00:09:49.442 - 00:09:52.805] Speaker 1: But because everyone is doubting, it's like, maybe...
[00:09:52.825 - 00:09:56.609] Speaker 2: The world will go on, we are not there, it won't matter to the world.
[00:09:56.790 - 00:10:00.113] Speaker 1: This was already in your mind, that today it doesn't matter.
[00:10:00.133 - 00:10:01.274] Speaker 2: It doesn't matter to anyone.
[00:10:01.294 - 00:10:05.518] Speaker 2: So if we are going to be forgotten, why waste time?
[00:10:08.221 - 00:10:14.167] Speaker 2: The only difference is I've lived my life predominantly in front of the camera for 20 years.
[00:10:14.187 - 00:10:15.689] Speaker 2: 20-25 years.
[00:10:16.169 - 00:10:16.850] Speaker 2: So I'm seen.
[00:10:18.146 - 00:10:22.811] Speaker 2: But even if there is no light on and there is no camera facing me, I am just the same.
[00:10:23.712 - 00:10:24.112] Speaker 1: Ditto.
[00:10:24.513 - 00:10:24.953] Speaker 1: Ditto.
[00:10:24.973 - 00:10:28.577] Speaker 1: Has it ever happened that there is someone more powerful?
[00:10:28.637 - 00:10:29.298] Speaker 1: You know in your head.
[00:10:29.478 - 00:10:31.881] Speaker 1: We all know that who is more powerful, who is more rich.
[00:10:31.901 - 00:10:33.322] Speaker 2: There is no one more powerful, Raj.
[00:10:33.743 - 00:10:36.166] Speaker 2: But there is some level of context.
[00:10:36.186 - 00:10:39.729] Speaker 2: I like this name because I have seen everyone.
[00:10:40.610 - 00:10:43.313] Speaker 2: This power is a state of mind.
[00:10:43.353 - 00:10:44.254] Speaker 2: Nice.
[00:10:44.555 - 00:10:45.836] Speaker 2: It is not an individual.
[00:10:46.417 - 00:10:47.698] Speaker 2: It is not a position.
[00:10:48.002 - 00:10:49.263] Speaker 2: It is a state of mind.
[00:10:51.345 - 00:10:55.029] Speaker 2: And if you realize that, then you can leverage it.
[00:10:56.370 - 00:10:57.752] Speaker 2: But how do you define power?
[00:10:57.792 - 00:10:58.132] Speaker 2: Tell me.
[00:10:59.454 - 00:10:59.714] Speaker 1: I don't know.
[00:10:59.734 - 00:11:01.195] Speaker 1: I have a question and then I'll define.
[00:11:01.235 - 00:11:15.890] Speaker 1: How do you enter a room where you know inherently, that intelligence-wise, position-wise, money-wise, multiple other factors, whatever vanity metrics are there in the world, all of them are in a superior position than you.
[00:11:16.162 - 00:11:17.083] Speaker 1: Right?
[00:11:17.123 - 00:11:19.948] Speaker 1: Then, how do you not succumb to that power?
[00:11:20.008 - 00:11:21.831] Speaker 2: Why do you have to succumb to anything?
[00:11:21.931 - 00:11:23.954] Speaker 2: It feels like you're in a small room.
[00:11:24.415 - 00:11:24.855] Speaker 2: No, why?
[00:11:25.096 - 00:11:27.119] Speaker 2: You never felt it?
[00:11:27.279 - 00:11:28.381] Speaker 2: Never.
[00:11:28.401 - 00:11:29.883] Unknown: Even when I was a kid, I didn't feel it.
[00:11:29.903 - 00:11:30.203] Speaker 2: No.
[00:11:31.225 - 00:11:31.866] Speaker 2: That is what I'm saying.
[00:11:31.946 - 00:11:33.348] Speaker 2: Power is a state of mind.
[00:11:34.790 - 00:11:41.661] Speaker 2: If you presume somebody has more money than you, then look at exact the context that you've set up in a different fashion.
[00:11:42.302 - 00:11:43.143] Speaker 2: Why are you in the room?
[00:11:44.866 - 00:11:44.946] Unknown: Hmm.
[00:11:45.858 - 00:11:48.041] Speaker 2: That person with money, that person with power.
[00:11:49.222 - 00:11:50.764] Speaker 2: Why do they want you in the same room?
[00:11:53.147 - 00:11:56.312] Speaker 2: The fact that you understand that aspect means who has power.
[00:11:57.593 - 00:12:01.158] Speaker 1: You know, I don't let anyone be more powerful in this room.
[00:12:01.178 - 00:12:03.301] Speaker 1: I feel very friendly with somebody, whoever it is.
[00:12:03.761 - 00:12:07.126] Speaker 1: Because it's that... Maybe I've trained myself in that way.
[00:12:07.146 - 00:12:08.547] Speaker 2: It's the chip on the shoulder.
[00:12:08.567 - 00:12:09.629] Speaker 1: It looks like a chip on the shoulder.
[00:12:09.889 - 00:12:13.714] Speaker 2: No, even here if you're doing this, it's your chip on the shoulder.
[00:12:15.490 - 00:12:16.612] Speaker 1: But here I enjoy.
[00:12:16.632 - 00:12:19.355] Speaker 1: Here I won't let anyone be... Let's see.
[00:12:19.375 - 00:12:20.918] Speaker 1: There is no power position here.
[00:12:20.958 - 00:12:21.118] Speaker 2: No.
[00:12:21.699 - 00:12:24.563] Speaker 2: The fact that you say, I won't let anyone be is power.
[00:12:24.923 - 00:12:26.025] Speaker 1: How do you get off this?
[00:12:26.986 - 00:12:27.387] Speaker 2: You don't.
[00:12:28.869 - 00:12:31.492] Speaker 2: You have to live your life to your comfort and to your truth.
[00:12:32.594 - 00:12:35.738] Speaker 2: What may be true for me, what may be my way of life may not be yours.
[00:12:36.419 - 00:12:36.659] Speaker 1: True.
[00:12:37.060 - 00:12:38.242] Speaker 2: Why do you seek conformity?
[00:12:39.704 - 00:12:41.426] Speaker 2: If you stop seeking conformity,
[00:12:41.890 - 00:12:42.511] Speaker 2: You will stop.
[00:12:42.551 - 00:12:44.293] Speaker 2: Next step is to stop seeking validation.
[00:12:45.195 - 00:12:47.698] Speaker 1: Mentoring session with...
[00:12:48.740 - 00:12:49.881] Speaker 1: It's me and you.
[00:12:50.061 - 00:12:52.545] Speaker 1: I am on the other end of the podcast.
[00:12:52.565 - 00:12:52.805] Speaker 1: I love it.
[00:12:52.825 - 00:12:53.406] Speaker 2: But it's true.
[00:12:53.426 - 00:12:53.666] Speaker 2: Why?
[00:12:53.686 - 00:12:54.407] Speaker 1: I don't know.
[00:12:54.808 - 00:12:57.171] Speaker 1: It's that indoor boy comes out.
[00:12:57.271 - 00:12:58.073] Speaker 2: No, but that's okay.
[00:12:58.453 - 00:13:00.256] Speaker 2: That's what keeps you relevant to yourself.
[00:13:01.497 - 00:13:04.361] Speaker 2: It makes you watch over your shoulder always.
[00:13:04.982 - 00:13:10.610] Speaker 2: So anytime people tell me... See, our... Again, I'm just presuming.
[00:13:10.882 - 00:13:17.749] Speaker 2: Foundationally, you and I may have certain, you know, foundational pieces of our life which may be similar.
[00:13:17.829 - 00:13:20.592] Speaker 2: We are from Uttar Bharat, we have two normal families.
[00:13:20.612 - 00:13:22.333] Speaker 2: How have we taught how to deal with life?
[00:13:23.094 - 00:13:23.655] Speaker 2: We have never taught.
[00:13:25.617 - 00:13:25.917] Speaker 2: Right?
[00:13:26.417 - 00:13:30.481] Speaker 2: If we have a style of conversation, then what happens?
[00:13:30.501 - 00:13:33.965] Speaker 2: We meet two people and talk to each other.
[00:13:34.786 - 00:13:36.167] Speaker 2: We pick up the threads later.
[00:13:36.227 - 00:13:37.608] Speaker 2: We call these people friends.
[00:13:39.150 - 00:13:39.250] Unknown: Okay?
[00:13:39.426 - 00:13:42.129] Speaker 2: When we discuss these things, we do it openly.
[00:13:42.189 - 00:13:43.090] Speaker 2: We don't hide anything.
[00:13:43.110 - 00:13:44.331] Speaker 2: We do it transparently.
[00:13:45.853 - 00:13:48.415] Speaker 2: Now you do juxtaposition with it in the workplace.
[00:13:48.636 - 00:13:50.237] Speaker 2: It becomes your nature.
[00:13:51.459 - 00:13:57.105] Speaker 2: And suddenly you are in a workplace where you feel, my transparency has become my burden.
[00:13:57.125 - 00:13:59.587] Speaker 2: It is being used against me.
[00:13:59.607 - 00:13:59.847] Speaker 2: Why?
[00:13:59.867 - 00:14:02.570] Speaker 2: Because you have never been taught.
[00:14:02.590 - 00:14:06.194] Speaker 2: You have been told, Satyamvad Dharma.
[00:14:06.466 - 00:14:09.470] Speaker 2: means speak the truth and follow the path of dharma.
[00:14:10.411 - 00:14:15.838] Speaker 2: And since you have not been taught, you meet those people who have been taught this craft.
[00:14:15.858 - 00:14:25.850] Speaker 2: Who have been told, wear such clothes, meet these people, get out of the car like this.
[00:14:25.890 - 00:14:27.973] Speaker 2: If you meet someone superior, then you should behave like this.
[00:14:27.993 - 00:14:33.440] Speaker 2: Because they are watching that example from their own parents, their own family ecosystem.
[00:14:33.460 - 00:14:35.122] Speaker 2: What have we seen our parents do?
[00:14:36.194 - 00:14:39.259] Speaker 1: Hard work.
[00:14:39.279 - 00:14:40.721] Speaker 1: I didn't learn to play tricks.
[00:14:41.182 - 00:14:41.703] Speaker 2: I don't know.
[00:14:41.723 - 00:14:43.065] Speaker 2: That's not a trick.
[00:14:43.085 - 00:14:48.153] Speaker 2: I didn't even learn to be strategic.
[00:14:48.173 - 00:14:49.175] Speaker 2: That's their way of life.
[00:14:49.195 - 00:14:53.221] Speaker 2: That's why when you confront such a person, they say, Amrita sir, I mean, what are you saying?
[00:14:54.483 - 00:14:56.666] Speaker 2: Because they have their own life.
[00:14:56.686 - 00:14:57.948] Unknown: They have their own life.
[00:14:57.968 - 00:14:58.910] Speaker 2: They have their own life.
[00:14:59.791 - 00:15:01.935] Speaker 2: Like, here we need a lot of controversy.
[00:15:01.975 - 00:15:04.018] Speaker 2: Dynasty, Nepo also.
[00:15:04.674 - 00:15:05.996] Speaker 2: That is their way of life.
[00:15:07.077 - 00:15:08.478] Speaker 1: Do you think we should learn?
[00:15:08.498 - 00:15:10.401] Speaker 1: Does it make any difference?
[00:15:10.481 - 00:15:13.724] Speaker 2: Get down like this, wear like this, live like this?
[00:15:13.765 - 00:15:16.768] Speaker 2: Would you be in this room today if you learn all that?
[00:15:16.828 - 00:15:16.968] Speaker 1: No.
[00:15:17.008 - 00:15:19.011] Speaker 1: Then?
[00:15:19.031 - 00:15:20.552] Speaker 2: I don't even hit my hands and feet.
[00:15:20.572 - 00:15:20.713] Speaker 2: Then?
[00:15:20.733 - 00:15:22.835] Speaker 2: And hitting your hands and feet.
[00:15:22.855 - 00:15:24.217] Speaker 2: See, what is the mistake?
[00:15:24.237 - 00:15:30.384] Speaker 2: When people like us reach the peak and stop hitting our hands and feet.
[00:15:30.484 - 00:15:32.306] Speaker 2: Because the type that never accepts you,
[00:15:32.482 - 00:15:35.886] Speaker 2: Even then he will not accept, no matter how much you earn, how famous you become.
[00:15:36.327 - 00:15:38.670] Speaker 2: Does your life become like this?
[00:15:38.690 - 00:15:39.571] Speaker 2: Yes, 100%.
[00:15:39.591 - 00:15:49.083] Speaker 2: And you feel, I have sat in front of Bill Gates, but still for him I am like this.
[00:15:49.104 - 00:15:51.346] Speaker 2: And those people psychologically leverage your feeling.
[00:15:51.447 - 00:15:57.234] Speaker 2: And if you are trapped in that illusion that you
[00:15:57.794 - 00:16:00.699] Speaker 2: You keep waiting for their validation.
[00:16:00.799 - 00:16:04.967] Speaker 2: You focus on them and make new strategies and work on them.
[00:16:04.987 - 00:16:07.151] Speaker 2: It's your defeat, not theirs.
[00:16:07.171 - 00:16:09.996] Speaker 2: A journalist asked me, why are you doing Sadhvi Kavibhati?
[00:16:10.877 - 00:16:14.003] Speaker 2: I said, it's my wish.
[00:16:14.023 - 00:16:15.065] Speaker 2: She was like, excuse me?
[00:16:15.846 - 00:16:17.008] Speaker 2: I said, yes.
[00:16:17.028 - 00:16:18.531] Speaker 2: Earlier I used to say, why aren't you doing a job?
[00:16:18.551 - 00:16:20.194] Speaker 2: You are asking why are you doing a job?
[00:16:20.214 - 00:16:22.578] Speaker 2: Earlier I used to say, why did you make an actor into a minister?
[00:16:22.786 - 00:16:26.371] Speaker 2: Now you are saying, why didn't you make Shruti Rani a minister?
[00:16:26.451 - 00:16:30.075] Speaker 1: I will say, toss the coin and tell her.
[00:16:30.115 - 00:16:31.337] Speaker 2: What do you want to say?
[00:16:31.357 - 00:16:33.960] Speaker 2: I will say, I can't even read or write.
[00:16:33.980 - 00:16:37.885] Speaker 2: And many people will be proud of this.
[00:16:37.905 - 00:16:38.927] Speaker 2: What should I say then?
[00:16:39.007 - 00:16:42.672] Speaker 1: Do you think that as a woman, if you are a powerful woman, there is more criticism?
[00:16:42.812 - 00:16:44.414] Speaker 2: That happens.
[00:16:44.434 - 00:16:46.657] Speaker 2: If you are free, then there will be a problem.
[00:16:46.677 - 00:16:49.701] Speaker 1: Is it free or a problem of women in power?
[00:16:49.721 - 00:16:50.802] Speaker 2: What is the meaning of power?
[00:16:51.458 - 00:16:54.822] Speaker 2: It's not like you will suddenly get power.
[00:16:54.842 - 00:17:01.971] Speaker 2: I remember something called the IPU, International Parliamentary Union.
[00:17:02.031 - 00:17:05.315] Speaker 2: There was a meeting in Uganda in 2012 or 2013.
[00:17:05.335 - 00:17:07.238] Speaker 2: Meera Kumachi was the speaker of the opposition.
[00:17:07.458 - 00:17:11.043] Speaker 2: I was put in the team of a young parliamentarian.
[00:17:11.123 - 00:17:17.010] Speaker 2: And there was a meeting which was about networking.
[00:17:17.218 - 00:17:23.845] Speaker 2: So all the women politicians from all over the world came from the parliament, some were in defense, etc.
[00:17:23.865 - 00:17:28.891] Speaker 2: They were all sitting and drinking tea, suddenly they are having the same conversation.
[00:17:30.693 - 00:17:40.104] Speaker 2: How they have to be doubly alert, so that they are not looked upon as abrasive.
[00:17:40.124 - 00:17:44.028] Speaker 2: And these are women of the world and parliamentarians and ministers.
[00:17:44.369 - 00:17:45.650] Speaker 1: Around the world is same.
[00:17:45.762 - 00:17:46.663] Speaker 1: It's the same.
[00:17:46.903 - 00:17:48.685] Speaker 1: What do you have to take care of?
[00:17:48.705 - 00:17:49.646] Speaker 1: Tell me two or three things.
[00:17:50.026 - 00:17:54.510] Speaker 2: For them it is... And there is also a generational differentiated position.
[00:17:55.611 - 00:17:58.294] Speaker 2: There is a generation of women who are in their 50s, 60s.
[00:17:58.314 - 00:18:00.716] Speaker 2: They didn't put on too much lipstick.
[00:18:00.736 - 00:18:04.680] Speaker 2: So that they get merged in the background.
[00:18:05.521 - 00:18:08.243] Speaker 2: They didn't get their hair done properly.
[00:18:08.424 - 00:18:10.986] Speaker 2: They didn't wear good designer clothes.
[00:18:11.006 - 00:18:15.090] Speaker 2: So that they don't get noticed in their office.
[00:18:15.586 - 00:18:25.541] Speaker 2: You can notice that either they will face stiff backlash or their character would be assassinated.
[00:18:26.362 - 00:18:29.046] Speaker 2: So they are 50 years old who have had those experiences.
[00:18:29.066 - 00:18:32.752] Speaker 2: When you are between 20 and 30 years old, they say you are inexperienced.
[00:18:33.573 - 00:18:38.661] Speaker 2: When you are between 30 and 40 years old, then they say that you have kids.
[00:18:38.681 - 00:18:40.864] Speaker 2: You need time for the board exams.
[00:18:41.505 - 00:18:45.010] Speaker 2: When you are 40 to 50, you are told to make way for the 20 year old.
[00:18:45.186 - 00:18:47.470] Speaker 2: when you're 50-60 you might as well be dead.
[00:18:48.131 - 00:18:49.533] Speaker 2: Because they're like, are you still scared?
[00:18:51.055 - 00:18:52.017] Speaker 2: So it's not easy.
[00:18:53.279 - 00:18:56.363] Speaker 2: I'm not being one of those feminist.
[00:18:57.144 - 00:18:58.727] Speaker 2: This is the reality.
[00:18:58.747 - 00:19:01.031] Speaker 1: Have you ever faced this problem?
[00:19:01.051 - 00:19:01.211] Speaker 1: What?
[00:19:01.231 - 00:19:04.055] Speaker 2: Have you ever faced this problem?
[00:19:04.075 - 00:19:04.255] Speaker 2: No.
[00:19:04.396 - 00:19:04.476] Unknown: No?
[00:19:04.496 - 00:19:06.839] Speaker 2: I've never looked at the problem so carefully.
[00:19:06.860 - 00:19:09.043] Speaker 1: People must be irritated when they speak.
[00:19:09.243 - 00:19:09.884] Speaker 2: I don't know.
[00:19:10.085 - 00:19:13.650] Speaker 2: Nobody has the courage to say it out loud.
[00:19:15.842 - 00:19:20.589] Speaker 2: Earlier it used to be that 20 something are from the media.
[00:19:22.452 - 00:19:23.734] Speaker 2: Young people have become fools.
[00:19:25.777 - 00:19:26.338] Speaker 2: Which was good.
[00:19:27.460 - 00:19:28.622] Speaker 2: Because then they don't see you coming.
[00:19:29.764 - 00:19:32.909] Speaker 2: Then they, you and me, what are you doing?
[00:19:35.032 - 00:19:36.254] Speaker 1: Speak, speak.
[00:19:36.394 - 00:19:39.939] Speaker 2: And then slowly, slowly, speak, speak, speak, speak, work, work.
[00:19:40.440 - 00:19:44.146] Speaker 2: And suddenly of such a huge body of work that they can't deny you.
[00:19:44.290 - 00:19:46.652] Speaker 2: The problem will be now when you have proven.
[00:19:46.672 - 00:19:46.993] Speaker 1: Nice.
[00:19:48.534 - 00:19:50.176] Speaker 1: Have you felt...
[00:19:50.196 - 00:19:53.078] Speaker 1: I was reading about it in an article.
[00:19:54.720 - 00:20:00.085] Speaker 1: Specifically, it was talking about actually worldwide women all around the world.
[00:20:00.806 - 00:20:04.209] Speaker 1: Whenever they become powerful, people stop loving them.
[00:20:04.249 - 00:20:06.631] Speaker 1: People love them till the time they are very powerful.
[00:20:06.972 - 00:20:10.455] Speaker 1: After they are powerful, the cases of hatred change.
[00:20:10.836 - 00:20:13.458] Speaker 2: There is an expectation that you will be maternal.
[00:20:15.074 - 00:20:16.476] Speaker 2: It's not a wrong expectation.
[00:20:16.597 - 00:20:18.199] Speaker 2: It's not a bad reflection on men.
[00:20:19.441 - 00:20:21.364] Speaker 2: It is a bad reflection on upbringing.
[00:20:23.107 - 00:20:27.915] Speaker 1: So, the upbringing of everyone around the world is wrong?
[00:20:27.935 - 00:20:31.081] Speaker 2: We have made a context of how women are to be viewed.
[00:20:35.087 - 00:20:41.618] Speaker 2: We said that you are a nurturer and if you do something in that nurturing umbrella, then you are acceptable.
[00:20:44.674 - 00:20:46.417] Speaker 2: Your power should not shriek.
[00:20:48.060 - 00:20:49.402] Speaker 2: It should always whisper.
[00:20:51.225 - 00:20:55.933] Speaker 2: If power shrieks, then you truly do not understand power.
[00:20:57.035 - 00:20:58.096] Speaker 2: Silence is power.
[00:20:58.898 - 00:20:59.238] Unknown: Wow!
[00:20:59.719 - 00:21:00.721] Speaker 2: Absence is power.
[00:21:00.801 - 00:21:05.128] Speaker 2: I always tell people that one understands one's mother's true status after her death.
[00:21:05.148 - 00:21:06.831] Speaker 2: Till then you take it for granted.
[00:21:06.851 - 00:21:11.218] Speaker 2: The day you call and the voice of your mother doesn't come from there.
[00:21:15.554 - 00:21:23.064] Speaker 2: You will go home, no matter how big a man you are.
[00:21:24.546 - 00:21:32.497] Speaker 2: Even today, if he cries because of his mother, or even if he doesn't cry, if he just keeps his head in his mother's lap, then his mother finds out that something has happened.
[00:21:34.200 - 00:21:38.145] Speaker 2: And mother never asks for an explanation from you.
[00:21:38.165 - 00:21:39.327] Speaker 2: A father never speaks.
[00:21:41.490 - 00:21:44.434] Speaker 2: So we translate these emotions
[00:21:44.578 - 00:21:45.779] Speaker 2: on a wider canvas.
[00:21:47.161 - 00:21:48.723] Speaker 2: And you have to understand that.
[00:21:49.984 - 00:22:00.476] Speaker 2: It's not that, even if I am saying, you have brought the whole world in the shadow of a family.
[00:22:00.596 - 00:22:04.020] Speaker 2: Do you like the show of relatives who shout in the family?
[00:22:04.040 - 00:22:04.120] Unknown: No.
[00:22:04.140 - 00:22:11.088] Speaker 2: Then why will it come in politics?
[00:22:11.188 - 00:22:13.330] Speaker 2: Why do people come to you in politics?
[00:22:14.498 - 00:22:17.541] Speaker 2: That's why they come because they have some problem.
[00:22:17.561 - 00:22:20.685] Speaker 2: Some come because they want to become a thief.
[00:22:20.705 - 00:22:21.125] Speaker 2: Leave them.
[00:22:21.145 - 00:22:23.068] Speaker 2: Why do you have most of the people?
[00:22:23.088 - 00:22:24.109] Speaker 1: Because there is a problem.
[00:22:24.269 - 00:22:25.250] Speaker 2: There is a problem.
[00:22:25.270 - 00:22:27.493] Speaker 2: It means that you are hope.
[00:22:27.513 - 00:22:30.296] Speaker 2: You are not a human.
[00:22:30.316 - 00:22:31.617] Speaker 1: Nice.
[00:22:31.637 - 00:22:35.802] Speaker 2: So can hope be loud?
[00:22:36.843 - 00:22:38.064] Speaker 2: Hope is always silent.
[00:22:38.144 - 00:22:40.107] Speaker 1: You learnt all of these things or it was inherent?
[00:22:40.347 - 00:22:40.948] Speaker 2: This is me.
[00:22:41.288 - 00:22:43.090] Speaker 2: But I have never spoken about me.
[00:22:43.458 - 00:22:45.600] Speaker 2: 15 years I've spoken about my party.
[00:22:46.782 - 00:22:49.244] Speaker 2: Before that, I've spoken about my work as an actor.
[00:22:49.284 - 00:22:51.747] Speaker 2: These are the rare consequences.
[00:22:51.807 - 00:22:52.988] Speaker 2: Nobody's asked me all this.
[00:22:53.008 - 00:22:54.990] Speaker 1: What's the most misunderstood thing about you?
[00:22:55.271 - 00:22:55.771] Speaker 2: I don't know.
[00:22:56.272 - 00:22:59.876] Speaker 2: Because you're misunderstood in some metrics by many.
[00:23:00.056 - 00:23:02.098] Speaker 1: What do you think is the biggest misunderstanding?
[00:23:02.118 - 00:23:07.324] Speaker 2: I think it stems from the perception of, couldn't care less.
[00:23:09.306 - 00:23:10.607] Speaker 2: As a politician, do I deliver?
[00:23:10.968 - 00:23:11.188] Speaker 2: Yes.
[00:23:12.049 - 00:23:13.170] Speaker 2: To my party, I do.
[00:23:13.890 - 00:23:15.371] Speaker 2: To my constituents, I do.
[00:23:16.693 - 00:23:17.714] Speaker 2: To parliament, I do.
[00:23:19.776 - 00:23:28.544] Speaker 2: As a person who is building policy papers, I work with the CII, the Confederation of Indian Industries.
[00:23:28.604 - 00:23:29.605] Speaker 2: I work with Bill Gates.
[00:23:31.707 - 00:23:32.347] Speaker 2: Do I deliver?
[00:23:32.448 - 00:23:32.968] Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
[00:23:34.650 - 00:23:36.211] Speaker 2: As an actor, do I deliver on set?
[00:23:36.631 - 00:23:36.952] Speaker 2: I do.
[00:23:37.232 - 00:23:38.453] Speaker 2: Everybody knows that.
[00:23:38.473 - 00:23:42.757] Speaker 2: So people who are engaged with me, their expectations of me, do I fulfill?
[00:23:43.078 - 00:23:43.538] Speaker 2: Yes.
[00:23:45.250 - 00:23:48.795] Speaker 2: What do I have to do with others sitting in the children's room?
[00:23:48.855 - 00:23:51.198] Speaker 1: Sometimes it happens, like you know the whispers about you only.
[00:23:51.759 - 00:23:52.360] Speaker 2: Doesn't matter.
[00:23:53.301 - 00:23:54.463] Speaker 1: Never matter, never bother.
[00:23:54.623 - 00:23:56.265] Speaker 2: No, you should have whispers about you.
[00:23:56.826 - 00:23:59.389] Speaker 2: Otherwise, why would anyone pay attention to you?
[00:24:01.292 - 00:24:01.532] Speaker 1: True.
[00:24:02.453 - 00:24:04.396] Speaker 2: If you have no whispers, that means you are redundant.
[00:24:04.797 - 00:24:04.997] Speaker 1: Yeah.
[00:24:05.958 - 00:24:06.599] Speaker 1: So you like that.
[00:24:07.080 - 00:24:08.582] Speaker 1: Every little thing should be there.
[00:24:08.642 - 00:24:08.842] Speaker 2: No.
[00:24:10.024 - 00:24:14.610] Speaker 2: I have no attachments, which is I think the most scary part about being me.
[00:24:15.522 - 00:24:17.926] Speaker 2: I don't get swayed by popularity.
[00:24:17.946 - 00:24:20.069] Speaker 2: I don't get swayed by controversy.
[00:24:20.229 - 00:24:21.691] Speaker 2: I don't get swayed if you hate me.
[00:24:21.711 - 00:24:23.694] Speaker 2: I don't get swayed if you love me.
[00:24:23.794 - 00:24:24.956] Speaker 1: But tell me one time.
[00:24:25.136 - 00:24:26.058] Speaker 1: Okay, think hard.
[00:24:26.418 - 00:24:27.760] Speaker 1: And you have to tell me something.
[00:24:28.181 - 00:24:37.475] Speaker 1: But one time where... ...any rumour or any insight or something that really affected you, it got under your skin.
[00:24:37.635 - 00:24:38.797] Speaker 1: We all have that.
[00:24:39.057 - 00:24:40.439] Speaker 1: You're spiritually unaffected.
[00:24:40.480 - 00:24:42.302] Speaker 1: You're as a human being, I can see that.
[00:24:42.322 - 00:24:44.786] Speaker 2: Physically, mentally also unaffected.
[00:24:45.346 - 00:24:47.288] Speaker 1: Nothing has gotten under your skin.
[00:24:49.071 - 00:24:49.371] Speaker 1: Ever.
[00:24:50.753 - 00:24:52.114] Speaker 1: Even when they attack your family.
[00:24:52.174 - 00:24:58.182] Speaker 2: My family did not choose fame, attention.
[00:24:59.583 - 00:25:01.265] Speaker 2: Do they bear the consequences of it?
[00:25:01.345 - 00:25:01.626] Speaker 2: Yes.
[00:25:02.627 - 00:25:04.890] Speaker 2: But can I avoid what happens to us?
[00:25:06.151 - 00:25:06.552] Speaker 2: I can't.
[00:25:10.116 - 00:25:15.122] Speaker 2: Even if I was not famous, would they have gone through their own journeys of disappointments?
[00:25:15.746 - 00:25:18.849] Speaker 2: Would they have gone through their own journeys of backlashes?
[00:25:19.630 - 00:25:23.113] Speaker 2: Would they have gone through their own journeys where they are shattered as people?
[00:25:23.394 - 00:25:23.674] Speaker 2: Yes.
[00:25:25.996 - 00:25:30.040] Speaker 2: Today, I'm just one factor which makes it happen in their life.
[00:25:31.201 - 00:25:33.704] Speaker 2: Even if you remove them, suppose I died yesterday.
[00:25:34.765 - 00:25:39.169] Speaker 2: So, is there anyone in my family who is guaranteed to have no choice in life?
[00:25:39.189 - 00:25:43.954] Speaker 2: So, now I'm a factor, I'm not their whole life.
[00:25:44.546 - 00:25:46.969] Speaker 1: But then does it affect you?
[00:25:47.749 - 00:25:49.772] Speaker 1: I saw some clip where you got a little angry.
[00:25:50.672 - 00:25:53.055] Speaker 2: My issue is, does it affect me?
[00:25:53.596 - 00:25:59.221] Speaker 2: There's a speech of mine that goes viral of shouting at Sonia Gandhi.
[00:26:00.623 - 00:26:03.706] Speaker 2: My father had a stroke just 15 minutes before that.
[00:26:07.070 - 00:26:08.451] Speaker 2: I'm the eldest in my family.
[00:26:08.491 - 00:26:11.154] Speaker 2: I was the only one in Delhi.
[00:26:11.522 - 00:26:14.466] Speaker 2: I still remember 1030 hours to address the press.
[00:26:14.486 - 00:26:16.248] Speaker 2: 11 o'clock was parliament.
[00:26:16.268 - 00:26:22.115] Speaker 2: 1045, my father collapsed in CP, Karnat place in Delhi.
[00:26:22.776 - 00:26:25.159] Speaker 2: I was at Tugla Crescent at my official residence.
[00:26:26.121 - 00:26:31.427] Speaker 2: You are to present yourself to the parliament of India at 11 o'clock sharp.
[00:26:32.809 - 00:26:33.530] Speaker 2: So what do you do?
[00:26:33.870 - 00:26:34.792] Speaker 2: You have 15 minutes.
[00:26:34.812 - 00:26:35.873] Speaker 2: You can't get to CP.
[00:26:36.594 - 00:26:39.858] Speaker 2: You can get to parliament and you don't have the time to
[00:26:40.130 - 00:26:45.176] Speaker 2: seek permission from parliament to say, sir, I can't appear.
[00:26:45.857 - 00:26:46.057] Speaker 2: Why?
[00:26:46.117 - 00:26:48.419] Speaker 2: Because you're taking a position to defend the president of India.
[00:26:50.702 - 00:26:52.144] Speaker 2: So you rush.
[00:26:53.425 - 00:26:54.446] Speaker 2: I mean, I had nobody then.
[00:26:55.408 - 00:26:56.569] Speaker 2: I rushed to my assistant.
[00:26:57.270 - 00:27:01.655] Speaker 2: I said, go and Medanta, which was the hospital, which was one hour away.
[00:27:03.116 - 00:27:05.079] Speaker 2: My father's taken into emergency.
[00:27:05.379 - 00:27:06.340] Speaker 2: I go to parliament.
[00:27:06.580 - 00:27:08.082] Speaker 2: I mean, I know what I've lived in that
[00:27:08.546 - 00:27:10.108] Speaker 2: One hour, 15 minutes.
[00:27:10.309 - 00:27:12.131] Speaker 2: What was going on in your head?
[00:27:12.151 - 00:27:16.798] Speaker 2: Just to get him to a doctor and just to go to Parliament, finish my parliamentary obligations.
[00:27:17.920 - 00:27:25.951] Speaker 2: I finished my parliamentary obligations, went to the Speaker's room, sought permission, that's all, because I have to seek permission from the leadership.
[00:27:27.574 - 00:27:29.717] Speaker 2: And sought permission.
[00:27:29.977 - 00:27:34.223] Speaker 2: I still remember the Home Minister being there and the Speaker, they were in a meeting.
[00:27:34.664 - 00:27:36.146] Speaker 2: I'm sorry, but I'm saying this.
[00:27:36.482 - 00:27:38.805] Speaker 2: And I said, sir, my dad just had a stroke.
[00:27:39.366 - 00:27:40.288] Speaker 2: I need to get to him.
[00:27:42.171 - 00:27:43.913] Speaker 2: But those are your responsibilities.
[00:27:46.056 - 00:27:46.878] Speaker 2: You seek permission.
[00:27:47.679 - 00:27:48.660] Speaker 1: Even in that moment?
[00:27:48.700 - 00:27:48.941] Speaker 2: Yes.
[00:27:50.843 - 00:27:55.571] Speaker 2: And you go and you spend that time between the hospital and your parliamentary office.
[00:27:57.153 - 00:27:59.737] Speaker 2: Did your dad is okay to, you know, go about?
[00:28:00.418 - 00:28:05.906] Speaker 2: My son, I mean, collapsed the first time.
[00:28:05.986 - 00:28:08.068] Speaker 2: Second session of 2014.
[00:28:08.149 - 00:28:10.471] Speaker 2: Winter session, I think.
[00:28:11.733 - 00:28:15.036] Speaker 2: Between Aims and Parliament was on, even then.
[00:28:15.717 - 00:28:16.218] Speaker 2: It's runny.
[00:28:16.879 - 00:28:21.364] Speaker 2: None of my parliamentary colleagues knew, except my leadership, that my kid is in hospital.
[00:28:21.584 - 00:28:22.725] Speaker 1: What prepares you for this?
[00:28:22.866 - 00:28:23.727] Speaker 2: You've seen so much.
[00:28:25.048 - 00:28:30.194] Speaker 2: That your brain just works on, your brain actually works on
[00:28:30.274 - 00:28:36.725] Speaker 2: This happened, this happened, this happened, this is the solution, this is the solution, this is the solution.
[00:28:36.745 - 00:28:38.328] Speaker 2: Give all these solutions.
[00:28:38.428 - 00:28:39.850] Speaker 2: Do justice with every relation.
[00:28:39.870 - 00:28:42.915] Speaker 2: Fulfil the responsibility towards every relation.
[00:28:42.935 - 00:28:45.900] Speaker 1: But sometimes these pure emotions, it's your father, it's your kid.
[00:28:46.601 - 00:28:46.882] Speaker 1: Yes.
[00:28:47.383 - 00:28:50.929] Speaker 1: Don't you remember any logic at that time?
[00:28:51.189 - 00:28:56.498] Speaker 2: Like how do you... That is what I feel is your true test as an individual.
[00:28:56.962 - 00:29:04.089] Speaker 2: that does your emotion subsume you so much that your responsibility is given to you for no reason.
[00:29:04.329 - 00:29:06.592] Speaker 1: So you never left your responsibility behind?
[00:29:06.792 - 00:29:07.212] Speaker 2: No.
[00:29:07.232 - 00:29:10.255] Speaker 2: Like my mother-in-law was my daughter-in-law.
[00:29:11.036 - 00:29:11.777] Speaker 2: People talk about her.
[00:29:11.797 - 00:29:15.321] Speaker 2: My child was 3 days old when I came back to work.
[00:29:15.341 - 00:29:15.461] Speaker 2: Why?
[00:29:15.481 - 00:29:19.064] Speaker 2: Because I had to watch an episode at 10.30 pm.
[00:29:19.084 - 00:29:20.005] Speaker 2: I had a miscarriage.
[00:29:22.948 - 00:29:24.690] Speaker 2: I was working with two producers.
[00:29:25.346 - 00:29:27.829] Speaker 2: One of them is Ravi Chopra, who has passed away.
[00:29:28.230 - 00:29:30.773] Speaker 2: He says, Shruti, I can't actually afford to give you a week off.
[00:29:31.874 - 00:29:34.758] Speaker 2: But Ekta could not afford, because she was airing every day.
[00:29:37.161 - 00:29:40.885] Speaker 2: So somebody went and told her, no, she is lying.
[00:29:42.728 - 00:29:48.155] Speaker 2: Production people are like, we have to shoot, we are getting ready, Shruti Rani is not available.
[00:29:48.775 - 00:29:52.700] Speaker 2: She is lying, nothing has actually happened to her.
[00:29:52.720 - 00:29:54.162] Speaker 2: So you go and get your hospital reports.
[00:29:54.498 - 00:30:08.755] Speaker 2: You don't feel emotionally crushed at that time because you understand that the professionals need to hide behind certain things to make sure that they don't look bad in front of their boss.
[00:30:09.416 - 00:30:11.018] Speaker 2: Everybody is trying to get a job done.
[00:30:11.719 - 00:30:13.441] Speaker 2: Everybody is dependent on that salary.
[00:30:13.681 - 00:30:17.967] Speaker 1: Does all of this come from a sense of responsibility or does it come from a boss's order?
[00:30:18.027 - 00:30:20.690] Speaker 2: You are responsible also for other people who are dependent.
[00:30:21.602 - 00:30:25.789] Speaker 1: But is it the boss's order of responsibility that if they do it, they will be removed?
[00:30:25.809 - 00:30:28.013] Speaker 1: They were not allowing me to be removed.
[00:30:28.033 - 00:30:31.058] Speaker 2: Someone else would have gone.
[00:30:32.140 - 00:30:34.143] Speaker 2: His job would have gone.
[00:30:34.163 - 00:30:36.267] Speaker 2: His job can't go because of you.
[00:30:36.287 - 00:30:40.574] Speaker 2: There are too many factors at play when you are somebody like me.
[00:30:41.436 - 00:30:42.237] Speaker 2: It's not me alone.
[00:30:42.698 - 00:30:43.178] Unknown: True.
[00:30:43.198 - 00:30:47.065] Speaker 2: So, can you manage those factors to the best of your ability?
[00:30:47.125 - 00:30:47.666] Speaker 2: You should.
[00:30:48.546 - 00:30:51.029] Speaker 1: But tell me about that time, you didn't answer that.
[00:30:51.669 - 00:30:55.834] Speaker 1: There was any time when your family member gets attacked and it gets to your head?
[00:30:56.054 - 00:30:56.274] Speaker 2: No.
[00:30:56.715 - 00:30:57.756] Speaker 1: Irritates you from inside?
[00:30:57.776 - 00:30:57.896] Speaker 1: No.
[00:30:58.337 - 00:30:59.117] Speaker 1: Anger or anything?
[00:30:59.718 - 00:31:00.018] Speaker 2: No.
[00:31:00.559 - 00:31:13.373] Speaker 2: I think what happens is and what my people who love me do not want is something inside me snapping and me wanting to kind of settle that score.
[00:31:14.474 - 00:31:18.098] Speaker 2: Like you don't want this woman settling score.
[00:31:19.266 - 00:31:20.488] Speaker 2: Do you settle scores?
[00:31:21.749 - 00:31:21.949] Unknown: No.
[00:31:22.610 - 00:31:22.891] Speaker 1: Never?
[00:31:23.812 - 00:31:25.474] Speaker 2: No, I take it as an indication.
[00:31:28.037 - 00:31:28.798] Speaker 2: Genuinely.
[00:31:30.861 - 00:31:34.746] Speaker 2: Someone's life is reaching a certain level.
[00:31:35.627 - 00:31:37.329] Speaker 2: That everything will be downhill from now.
[00:31:38.251 - 00:31:39.552] Speaker 2: If they have done this to me.
[00:31:40.093 - 00:31:40.634] Speaker 2: It has happened.
[00:31:40.654 - 00:31:42.656] Speaker 2: So anytime somebody does something to me.
[00:31:44.278 - 00:31:47.122] Speaker 2: Earlier, everyone used to be intrigued when I used to smile.
[00:31:47.810 - 00:31:48.831] Speaker 2: And I was like, what's wrong with you?
[00:31:48.891 - 00:31:49.712] Speaker 2: Why would you smile?
[00:31:50.993 - 00:31:54.577] Speaker 2: And later when I started exhibiting these examples, I was like, oh my God!
[00:31:55.899 - 00:31:57.300] Speaker 2: So I genuinely believe.
[00:31:57.360 - 00:31:59.903] Speaker 2: It will happen.
[00:32:00.644 - 00:32:03.247] Speaker 1: That if someone did something wrong, then it's gone.
[00:32:03.267 - 00:32:03.707] Speaker 2: It will happen.
[00:32:03.727 - 00:32:05.750] Speaker 2: It will happen with them.
[00:32:05.810 - 00:32:09.914] Speaker 2: I mean, it's not like 10-20 years later, it will happen right there.
[00:32:10.254 - 00:32:12.177] Speaker 2: Immediately.
[00:32:12.197 - 00:32:13.218] Speaker 2: You will hear it in a month or two.
[00:32:13.558 - 00:32:13.979] Speaker 2: It starts.
[00:32:15.881 - 00:32:17.202] Speaker 2: You have to know.
[00:32:17.442 - 00:32:20.186] Speaker 2: that you're not where you are without God's blessing.
[00:32:20.266 - 00:32:27.636] Speaker 2: So, if it is a domino effect and you're being pushed and means somebody don't either get pushed back or pushed forward.
[00:32:28.737 - 00:32:30.800] Speaker 2: You have to realize that you're that one little thing.
[00:32:32.182 - 00:32:33.324] Speaker 2: I realized that very early.
[00:32:34.926 - 00:32:38.430] Speaker 2: I started seeing those examples before me.
[00:32:39.492 - 00:32:41.455] Speaker 1: Wow, so you got this realization very early.
[00:32:41.975 - 00:32:44.018] Speaker 2: No, because it happened right in front of me.
[00:32:44.322 - 00:32:44.983] Speaker 1: Give me an example.
[00:32:45.003 - 00:32:46.304] Speaker 1: Lucky enough to observe.
[00:32:46.444 - 00:32:49.367] Speaker 1: Give me an example from childhood.
[00:32:49.508 - 00:32:53.072] Speaker 2: I was working with somebody till the last day of the 9th month.
[00:32:53.652 - 00:32:55.134] Speaker 2: While I was also doing Kyunki.
[00:32:55.995 - 00:32:57.156] Speaker 2: It was a daily talk show.
[00:32:58.177 - 00:33:03.082] Speaker 2: And I was told that you should do a 30-day bank.
[00:33:03.102 - 00:33:04.624] Speaker 2: And shoot episodes from before.
[00:33:04.644 - 00:33:06.226] Speaker 2: This is for the lay person who is watching.
[00:33:07.127 - 00:33:08.869] Speaker 2: And then you come to work after 30 days.
[00:33:09.189 - 00:33:10.911] Speaker 2: Imagine this was my first tint.
[00:33:11.512 - 00:33:12.773] Speaker 2: Then I just bought a house.
[00:33:12.893 - 00:33:13.714] Speaker 2: I have an EMI.
[00:33:14.434 - 00:33:17.658] Speaker 2: And the doctor told me, what to do?
[00:33:17.678 - 00:33:18.499] Speaker 2: Your health will get worse.
[00:33:18.619 - 00:33:24.706] Speaker 2: If something happens to the baby, I will go back to this job after 30 days.
[00:33:24.726 - 00:33:27.108] Speaker 2: We will fill up the EMI quickly.
[00:33:28.069 - 00:33:29.391] Speaker 2: You are 25 years old.
[00:33:31.093 - 00:33:34.457] Speaker 2: And I am in the hospital after giving birth to my baby.
[00:33:35.258 - 00:33:36.159] Speaker 2: And I hear I am fired.
[00:33:36.539 - 00:33:37.320] Speaker 1: Right before?
[00:33:38.722 - 00:33:39.783] Speaker 2: Just after having the baby.
[00:33:39.883 - 00:33:42.706] Speaker 2: And I just shot like a day before.
[00:33:44.322 - 00:33:47.447] Speaker 2: And they were just waiting for me to get into the hospital to say you're fired.
[00:33:47.547 - 00:33:47.987] Speaker 1: And why?
[00:33:48.168 - 00:33:49.109] Speaker 1: Just.
[00:33:49.129 - 00:33:50.912] Speaker 1: That you'll take a break, that's why you're still firing?
[00:33:50.932 - 00:33:54.577] Speaker 2: Yes, we have made a bank, so we'll replace it by then.
[00:33:55.198 - 00:33:59.845] Speaker 2: So the hard work that I had done, it was their intention to use it to replace me.
[00:34:00.726 - 00:34:01.427] Speaker 2: I started smiling.
[00:34:01.948 - 00:34:04.071] Speaker 2: The bridge was handy.
[00:34:04.091 - 00:34:08.077] Speaker 2: And my family was like, why is she smiling?
[00:34:08.097 - 00:34:10.180] Speaker 2: She has a lot of pressure on her.
[00:34:10.460 - 00:34:11.762] Speaker 2: I was smiling.
[00:34:11.970 - 00:34:15.578] Speaker 2: And I think that's the first time I told my family that this is going to happen.
[00:34:16.560 - 00:34:17.382] Speaker 2: So they said, why?
[00:34:17.502 - 00:34:20.449] Speaker 2: I said, no, I used to write mostly the script also.
[00:34:20.509 - 00:34:21.471] Speaker 2: I used to do everything.
[00:34:22.113 - 00:34:26.482] Speaker 2: I used to do it for the show.
[00:34:27.224 - 00:34:29.509] Speaker 2: So they hired a film actor for it.
[00:34:30.271 - 00:34:31.794] Speaker 2: You know, we'll hire somebody who's
[00:34:32.226 - 00:34:35.872] Speaker 2: Exhibits is much more bigger intellectual, bigger name.
[00:34:35.932 - 00:34:36.793] Speaker 2: Blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:36.813 - 00:34:37.454] Speaker 2: I kept smiling.
[00:34:37.474 - 00:34:38.215] Speaker 2: And the show shut down.
[00:34:38.235 - 00:34:39.497] Speaker 2: And the show never started again.
[00:34:39.698 - 00:34:42.843] Speaker 1: Smriti Rani's hidden superpower.
[00:34:42.863 - 00:34:44.185] Speaker 2: It is just God.
[00:34:45.126 - 00:34:46.088] Speaker 2: It is genuinely God.
[00:34:47.550 - 00:34:53.960] Speaker 2: We spend our whole life in half regret and half revenge.
[00:34:53.980 - 00:34:54.981] Speaker 2: I don't do both.
[00:34:55.082 - 00:34:55.863] Speaker 1: There is no regret.
[00:34:57.345 - 00:34:57.906] Speaker 1: There must be one.
[00:34:58.402 - 00:35:01.126] Speaker 1: You have made this mentality.
[00:35:01.146 - 00:35:01.446] Speaker 2: No, no.
[00:35:01.867 - 00:35:03.769] Speaker 2: I always used to do this.
[00:35:03.789 - 00:35:05.372] Speaker 2: You will have choices in life.
[00:35:06.033 - 00:35:08.136] Speaker 2: Once you consciously chose something.
[00:35:08.756 - 00:35:10.979] Speaker 2: Assume that the result was not good.
[00:35:11.941 - 00:35:12.682] Speaker 2: It's your choice.
[00:35:12.702 - 00:35:13.623] Speaker 2: How can you regret?
[00:35:13.663 - 00:35:17.468] Speaker 2: Assume that you chose something and left it.
[00:35:17.749 - 00:35:20.433] Speaker 2: That you succeeded a lot.
[00:35:21.194 - 00:35:22.095] Speaker 2: But it was your choice.
[00:35:22.115 - 00:35:24.338] Speaker 2: How can you regret?
[00:35:24.642 - 00:35:30.308] Speaker 2: In that circumstance, in that time, in that life mode, you calculated it.
[00:35:30.348 - 00:35:35.074] Speaker 2: Which every human does.
[00:35:35.094 - 00:35:35.414] Speaker 2: It's okay.
[00:35:35.434 - 00:35:37.757] Speaker 2: But it didn't happen that I left it.
[00:35:37.777 - 00:35:38.097] Speaker 2: It got bigger.
[00:35:38.177 - 00:35:40.880] Speaker 2: You have to be tuned in every minute of the day.
[00:35:42.242 - 00:35:43.423] Speaker 2: And not get swayed at all.
[00:35:44.704 - 00:35:47.608] Speaker 2: You have to know what is an act and what is reality.
[00:35:47.628 - 00:35:51.252] Speaker 1: You know online people say you have built a very intimidating personality.
[00:35:51.672 - 00:35:52.093] Speaker 1: Do you think so?
[00:35:52.733 - 00:35:53.234] Speaker 2: I don't know.
[00:35:54.018 - 00:35:58.325] Speaker 2: If they are online and have never met me offline, how do they know?
[00:35:58.345 - 00:35:59.106] Speaker 1: By the persona.
[00:35:59.386 - 00:36:00.728] Speaker 1: People make their own opinion.
[00:36:00.748 - 00:36:03.813] Speaker 1: Those who have never met me offline, they have an online opinion.
[00:36:03.833 - 00:36:05.976] Speaker 1: Do you feel like you have made an intimidating personality?
[00:36:06.717 - 00:36:10.142] Speaker 1: You have a very powerful, very strong, certain personality.
[00:36:10.182 - 00:36:11.404] Speaker 2: I was always like this.
[00:36:11.625 - 00:36:16.312] Speaker 2: Even when we were like, standing on the street and I used to be like, I will become.
[00:36:16.332 - 00:36:17.193] Speaker 2: I was 7 years old.
[00:36:17.614 - 00:36:18.916] Speaker 2: But Madhu was like, your mind is bad.
[00:36:18.936 - 00:36:20.478] Speaker 1: What did you say, Satan?
[00:36:20.879 - 00:36:21.700] Speaker 2: I will become a success.
[00:36:21.720 - 00:36:23.122] Speaker 2: I will buy this house.
[00:36:23.426 - 00:36:24.267] Speaker 2: We were f**ked.
[00:36:24.587 - 00:36:25.929] Speaker 2: And my mother was like, what's wrong with you?
[00:36:27.351 - 00:36:30.795] Speaker 2: When I came first to Mumbai, Bombay then, I was 17.
[00:36:31.575 - 00:36:38.664] Speaker 2: Kamla Nehru Park, there is a shoe park, there is a marine line, you can see the marine drive, the lights are shining.
[00:36:38.704 - 00:36:40.045] Speaker 2: One day I had to go to the city.
[00:36:40.065 - 00:36:43.429] Speaker 1: I was like, are you crazy?
[00:36:43.449 - 00:36:45.652] Speaker 2: 7 years, 17 years.
[00:36:45.672 - 00:36:47.474] Speaker 2: I was like this everywhere.
[00:36:47.778 - 00:36:50.883] Speaker 2: One day, a journalist asked me, what happened to you?
[00:36:52.004 - 00:36:52.765] Speaker 1: Can't you see it?
[00:36:52.785 - 00:36:58.354] Speaker 1: What kind of question is this?
[00:36:58.374 - 00:36:59.355] Speaker 2: Can't you see it?
[00:36:59.375 - 00:37:00.677] Speaker 2: So, I told my students to manifest.
[00:37:00.797 - 00:37:02.480] Speaker 2: I laugh a lot.
[00:37:02.980 - 00:37:04.242] Speaker 2: Manifest is genuine.
[00:37:04.262 - 00:37:08.649] Speaker 2: If you don't believe in yourself, why would the other person believe in you?
[00:37:08.669 - 00:37:13.035] Speaker 1: When did you realize that I am certain, dreamy?
[00:37:13.576 - 00:37:15.339] Speaker 1: Not dreamy, certain.
[00:37:15.419 - 00:37:17.682] Speaker 1: But certain for dreams.
[00:37:18.498 - 00:37:20.880] Speaker 1: Okay, this dream is a reality.
[00:37:20.900 - 00:37:23.183] Speaker 2: I mean, I have never read Mill and Boons in my life.
[00:37:23.483 - 00:37:26.406] Speaker 1: I am going to read Hardy Boys.
[00:37:26.426 - 00:37:27.807] Speaker 2: You will read Hardy Boys.
[00:37:27.847 - 00:37:29.149] Speaker 2: I mean, read Mar Dharwari novels.
[00:37:29.169 - 00:37:30.170] Speaker 2: I am that kind of a person.
[00:37:30.530 - 00:37:33.353] Speaker 1: You used to say this, but has there been any such realization at some point?
[00:37:33.373 - 00:37:33.653] Speaker 1: Seven.
[00:37:34.474 - 00:37:38.658] Speaker 1: Seven P. Realization has come that I was born to break.
[00:37:38.898 - 00:37:40.360] Speaker 1: To break?
[00:37:40.380 - 00:37:45.325] Speaker 1: That's just now you are... Has this generationally passed on or not yet?
[00:37:45.345 - 00:37:46.186] Speaker 1: It has.
[00:37:46.206 - 00:37:46.386] Unknown: Okay.
[00:37:46.754 - 00:37:50.680] Speaker 1: Now your kids are like...
[00:37:52.342 - 00:37:52.843] Speaker 1: I like this.
[00:37:53.103 - 00:37:54.745] Speaker 1: You have used your voice a lot.
[00:37:54.765 - 00:37:55.266] Speaker 2: I told them.
[00:37:55.286 - 00:37:59.913] Speaker 2: I told them that you might not be able to do what your mother did in your life.
[00:37:59.933 - 00:38:01.795] Speaker 2: Because you have never seen Gurbak.
[00:38:01.895 - 00:38:03.518] Speaker 2: You don't know.
[00:38:03.638 - 00:38:07.203] Speaker 2: You will have your own challenges.
[00:38:08.405 - 00:38:09.626] Speaker 2: You won't have your own.
[00:38:11.489 - 00:38:12.210] Speaker 1: Tell me what?
[00:38:12.546 - 00:38:14.889] Speaker 1: What does poverty teach that privilege can never teach?
[00:38:15.069 - 00:38:16.170] Speaker 2: Ambition, tenacity.
[00:38:16.390 - 00:38:21.016] Speaker 1: And what is the difference between people who have ambition?
[00:38:21.036 - 00:38:21.216] Unknown: Breaking.
[00:38:21.236 - 00:38:21.416] Unknown: Breaking.
[00:38:21.436 - 00:38:22.297] Speaker 1: And what is the difference?
[00:38:22.497 - 00:38:24.880] Speaker 1: Poverty breaks people and also teaches them to break.
[00:38:25.781 - 00:38:27.683] Speaker 1: Some people break and some people learn to break.
[00:38:28.504 - 00:38:29.085] Speaker 1: What is the difference?
[00:38:29.125 - 00:38:30.606] Speaker 2: What do you think is the difference between them?
[00:38:30.626 - 00:38:39.777] Speaker 2: I have seen breaking and there is nothing more scary than to see a male member of your family cry.
[00:38:39.837 - 00:38:40.237] Speaker 2: Have you seen that?
[00:38:40.257 - 00:38:40.818] Speaker 1: I have seen that.
[00:38:41.570 - 00:38:43.232] Speaker 2: Yes, there is nothing scarier than that.
[00:38:43.974 - 00:38:44.755] Speaker 1: When they are helpless.
[00:38:46.077 - 00:38:49.241] Speaker 2: Leave women, I have seen men crying in poverty.
[00:38:49.262 - 00:38:58.796] Speaker 2: And if you are raised with this mentality, No, people make fun of it these days, men don't get scared.
[00:38:58.836 - 00:39:05.105] Speaker 2: But for you, foundationally, the male member can't break.
[00:39:05.786 - 00:39:10.994] Speaker 2: In our ordinary families, women are shocked to see men breaking.
[00:39:11.554 - 00:39:15.960] Speaker 2: Because with that mentality we are raised.
[00:39:15.980 - 00:39:21.167] Speaker 2: Father, husband, father-in-law, all these cannot be broken.
[00:39:22.770 - 00:39:25.694] Speaker 2: Imagine, these pegs of the family don't speak much.
[00:39:25.714 - 00:39:30.701] Speaker 2: I didn't want to go through that.
[00:39:30.721 - 00:39:37.490] Speaker 2: That in my house, the men,
[00:39:38.370 - 00:39:43.638] Speaker 2: Even if they come to the point of breaking, they say, call Sundari.
[00:39:43.658 - 00:39:47.004] Speaker 2: I want to become that.
[00:39:47.024 - 00:39:50.910] Speaker 2: Wherever my father is, he is 75 years old.
[00:39:51.191 - 00:39:55.357] Speaker 2: Wherever my mother is, she is 75 years old.
[00:39:55.377 - 00:40:00.646] Speaker 2: Whoever is connected to me from my family, my family is a big thing.
[00:40:00.966 - 00:40:05.874] Speaker 2: Whoever loves me, or whoever I love, whoever I am in any corner of the world, my colleagues,
[00:40:07.810 - 00:40:11.996] Speaker 2: I told him to stay here, I called Shruti, she will come.
[00:40:12.016 - 00:40:15.562] Speaker 2: That trust is my wealth.
[00:40:15.582 - 00:40:28.121] Speaker 2: On set, when I was a minister and I didn't have any discussion with anyone, I didn't have any discussions in Covid, I always used to say to people, will you reach Shruti?
[00:40:28.141 - 00:40:29.283] Speaker 2: People used to say, just reach Didi.
[00:40:30.845 - 00:40:32.047] Speaker 2: Will you reach her?
[00:40:32.067 - 00:40:33.970] Speaker 2: Didi said, it will be done, it will be done.
[00:40:34.690 - 00:40:40.978] Speaker 2: In Covid, one of my friends, Parivari, who is in the hospital, he said, Swati, leave it.
[00:40:41.018 - 00:40:43.341] Speaker 2: The numbers are overwhelming.
[00:40:43.361 - 00:40:47.306] Speaker 2: Whoever called me, he called me with confidence.
[00:40:47.326 - 00:40:48.948] Speaker 2: He said, Sandeepa will go.
[00:40:50.650 - 00:40:53.554] Speaker 2: And nobody should have that confidence broken.
[00:40:55.997 - 00:41:02.285] Speaker 2: If you say, I am proud of something, I am proud of that.
[00:41:02.385 - 00:41:02.866] Speaker 2: That if you
[00:41:03.554 - 00:41:04.675] Speaker 2: In any condition.
[00:41:04.695 - 00:41:05.436] Speaker 2: You can meet me anytime.
[00:41:05.456 - 00:41:07.378] Speaker 2: You can meet me anytime.
[00:41:07.538 - 00:41:09.580] Speaker 2: You have accepted my Pranaam.
[00:41:09.600 - 00:41:11.682] Speaker 2: You have accepted my Pranaam.
[00:41:11.702 - 00:41:13.123] Speaker 2: You are in trouble.
[00:41:13.143 - 00:41:15.205] Speaker 2: I will never disappoint you.
[00:41:15.225 - 00:41:16.707] Speaker 2: Because I know that I am alone in trouble.
[00:41:16.727 - 00:41:17.868] Speaker 1: When did you realize this?
[00:41:17.888 - 00:41:22.732] Speaker 2: I have realized this from the beginning.
[00:41:22.772 - 00:41:23.713] Speaker 1: That however I am.
[00:41:23.753 - 00:41:26.796] Speaker 1: When did you realize that I have to become a part of my family?
[00:41:27.317 - 00:41:28.498] Speaker 2: From the beginning.
[00:41:28.598 - 00:41:28.718] Speaker 2: Early.
[00:41:28.758 - 00:41:30.760] Speaker 2: Whatever it is, from somewhere.
[00:41:30.780 - 00:41:31.741] Speaker 2: Even if it is from the neighborhood.
[00:41:31.761 - 00:41:32.882] Speaker 2: I mean, where my father used to live,
[00:41:33.698 - 00:41:38.284] Speaker 2: In Gurgaon, in New Colony, there was a message that there was a dry cleaning shop.
[00:41:38.445 - 00:41:42.671] Speaker 2: I didn't know that the room we stayed in was a dry cleaner's store room.
[00:41:43.832 - 00:41:45.374] Speaker 2: When you are a kid, you have no idea.
[00:41:45.455 - 00:41:50.822] Speaker 2: When I went back, I was like, I used to live in a dry cleaner's store.
[00:41:50.842 - 00:41:52.284] Speaker 2: Me and my parents.
[00:41:52.304 - 00:41:58.613] Speaker 2: I used to think that it takes a lot of time to clean the house.
[00:41:58.633 - 00:42:02.098] Speaker 2: I didn't know where we were staying.
[00:42:02.274 - 00:42:10.926] Speaker 2: When a relative passed away abroad, he messaged me at 11 o'clock in the night, that we are searching for Shruti Rani.
[00:42:10.946 - 00:42:15.492] Speaker 2: We used to live in her neighbourhood when she was 5-6 years old.
[00:42:15.512 - 00:42:19.678] Speaker 2: So I got a call at 11 o'clock, I think 11.15 or 11.30, I called him.
[00:42:19.738 - 00:42:21.300] Speaker 2: I said, you called?
[00:42:22.081 - 00:42:27.889] Speaker 2: He said, yes, my brother's son died somewhere, we have to bring his body back, Shruti.
[00:42:28.951 - 00:42:29.531] Speaker 2: Can you help?
[00:42:29.992 - 00:42:31.474] Speaker 2: It happened a month ago.
[00:42:31.714 - 00:42:34.077] Speaker 2: No, three weeks ago.
[00:42:34.097 - 00:42:37.262] Speaker 2: I was like, yes.
[00:42:37.282 - 00:42:41.147] Speaker 2: The people around me were like, yes, yes, she's saying yes, she won't do anything.
[00:42:41.167 - 00:42:46.835] Speaker 2: I said, tomorrow morning the embassy will open, we will call, we will do it.
[00:42:46.855 - 00:42:49.599] Speaker 2: The next morning I said, did you get a call or not?
[00:42:49.619 - 00:42:51.461] Speaker 2: So my staff said, ma'am, I didn't get a call.
[00:42:51.481 - 00:42:53.745] Speaker 2: I said, I didn't call, I didn't pick up the phone.
[00:42:54.265 - 00:42:55.447] Speaker 2: Track it, trace it.
[00:42:56.388 - 00:43:00.594] Speaker 2: Finally, that uncle told my staff, the embassy woke up in the morning and helped themselves.
[00:43:00.834 - 00:43:02.797] Speaker 2: But Shruti followed.
[00:43:05.380 - 00:43:11.367] Speaker 2: So if you are someone's last hope, you can't not afford to turn up.
[00:43:12.529 - 00:43:15.112] Speaker 1: What in you wants to help them?
[00:43:15.132 - 00:43:15.653] Speaker 1: You can afford not to.
[00:43:15.673 - 00:43:15.993] Speaker 2: Because you can.
[00:43:17.275 - 00:43:18.236] Speaker 2: How can you not?
[00:43:19.758 - 00:43:23.723] Speaker 2: If God gives you that opportunity, how can you not?
[00:43:26.006 - 00:43:29.010] Speaker 2: Raj, may be no one helped you.
[00:43:29.506 - 00:43:32.750] Speaker 2: But whoever did it, do you remember today?
[00:43:32.770 - 00:43:33.211] Speaker 1: All the people.
[00:43:33.891 - 00:43:40.700] Speaker 2: And if God does not help you, if someone comes to you and asks for help, will you not do it?
[00:43:40.740 - 00:43:41.981] Speaker 2: 100%.
[00:43:42.001 - 00:43:43.663] Speaker 2: Then what difference does it make to me?
[00:43:44.104 - 00:43:50.712] Speaker 1: Because you are in a position where you may not be able to help as many people as they are asking for.
[00:43:51.253 - 00:43:55.518] Speaker 2: This has never happened to me.
[00:43:55.538 - 00:43:58.001] Speaker 2: In the constituency I was in, there were 10 lakh voters.
[00:43:58.021 - 00:43:58.802] Speaker 2: This has never happened.
[00:44:01.314 - 00:44:02.315] Speaker 1: How can it be possible?
[00:44:02.335 - 00:44:03.216] Speaker 2: It's possible.
[00:44:03.236 - 00:44:08.303] Speaker 1: There must be someone left, someone's voice hasn't reached you.
[00:44:08.323 - 00:44:10.786] Speaker 2: If someone has reached me, then it has helped me.
[00:44:10.806 - 00:44:13.209] Speaker 1: So reaching you must be very difficult?
[00:44:13.509 - 00:44:15.151] Speaker 2: No.
[00:44:15.172 - 00:44:16.373] Speaker 2: Those who reach always reach.
[00:44:16.894 - 00:44:20.138] Speaker 1: You are accessible to everybody.
[00:44:21.740 - 00:44:24.023] Speaker 2: Once two actors were talking to me outside the house.
[00:44:24.523 - 00:44:28.669] Speaker 2: Suddenly someone was running away from the cart, I am fine.
[00:44:29.349 - 00:44:29.810] Speaker 2: I said,
[00:44:30.370 - 00:44:34.397] Speaker 2: Mummy is facing this problem, which village?
[00:44:34.417 - 00:44:36.801] Speaker 2: This is the police station, will you give me a call?
[00:44:37.442 - 00:44:38.264] Speaker 2: I had never met him.
[00:44:38.804 - 00:44:41.689] Speaker 2: He is working here in the city.
[00:44:41.709 - 00:44:46.598] Speaker 2: But he knows that... Will you give me a call?
[00:44:47.740 - 00:44:49.583] Speaker 2: She will give you a call.
[00:44:49.603 - 00:44:51.606] Speaker 2: She will give me a call.
[00:44:51.626 - 00:44:55.393] Speaker 2: How many people in BJP, how many people have worked with him for 25 years.
[00:44:55.413 - 00:44:56.114] Speaker 2: He knows that...
[00:44:56.994 - 00:44:57.775] Speaker 2: X, Y, Z.
[00:44:58.135 - 00:44:59.016] Speaker 2: Do you want to reach Shwanti?
[00:44:59.156 - 00:44:59.417] Speaker 2: Or me?
[00:44:59.917 - 00:45:00.578] Speaker 2: I will reach out.
[00:45:01.058 - 00:45:01.839] Speaker 2: Will you help her?
[00:45:01.859 - 00:45:02.340] Speaker 2: Okay.
[00:45:03.401 - 00:45:05.824] Speaker 1: This is about your strength.
[00:45:06.004 - 00:45:06.985] Speaker 1: Tell me your weakness.
[00:45:07.786 - 00:45:09.768] Speaker 2: I listen to music very fast.
[00:45:09.788 - 00:45:10.729] Speaker 2: With hands free.
[00:45:11.890 - 00:45:12.691] Speaker 2: I shouldn't listen.
[00:45:12.711 - 00:45:13.272] Speaker 2: Come on.
[00:45:13.893 - 00:45:14.413] Speaker 2: No seriously.
[00:45:14.974 - 00:45:16.015] Speaker 2: There should be discipline.
[00:45:16.415 - 00:45:17.897] Speaker 2: Discipline of not working out.
[00:45:20.880 - 00:45:22.822] Speaker 2: I am very lazy after doing so much.
[00:45:23.944 - 00:45:26.226] Speaker 1: With workout you don't want to do.
[00:45:26.562 - 00:45:27.684] Speaker 1: You don't like?
[00:45:27.724 - 00:45:29.266] Speaker 2: That is the one thing I didn't look out for.
[00:45:29.386 - 00:45:29.887] Speaker 1: My health.
[00:45:31.009 - 00:45:32.150] Speaker 2: You never have...
[00:45:32.170 - 00:45:34.093] Speaker 2: It's not a good excuse.
[00:45:34.394 - 00:45:35.896] Speaker 1: But you don't have time.
[00:45:35.916 - 00:45:37.057] Speaker 2: I did not have time.
[00:45:37.358 - 00:45:39.601] Speaker 2: Now I realize I should make time.
[00:45:40.202 - 00:45:43.106] Speaker 2: But it's very difficult.
[00:45:43.126 - 00:45:44.428] Speaker 2: I tell myself, don't eat sugar.
[00:45:44.468 - 00:45:48.094] Speaker 2: Then I think, in Jabalpur, there is Mawai Jalebi.
[00:45:48.134 - 00:45:50.217] Speaker 2: Very bad weakness.
[00:45:50.237 - 00:45:51.499] Speaker 2: Very, very bad weakness.
[00:45:52.019 - 00:45:55.424] Speaker 1: What's one insecurity?
[00:45:55.465 - 00:45:56.466] Speaker 1: What's your biggest insecurity?
[00:45:56.962 - 00:45:58.685] Speaker 2: Don't have any.
[00:45:58.705 - 00:46:00.287] Speaker 2: I don't believe.
[00:46:00.307 - 00:46:01.529] Speaker 2: What will be insecure?
[00:46:01.549 - 00:46:02.050] Speaker 1: Tell me.
[00:46:02.070 - 00:46:02.731] Speaker 1: What should I tell you?
[00:46:02.791 - 00:46:03.672] Speaker 1: There is something in everyone.
[00:46:03.692 - 00:46:04.173] Speaker 1: What do you want?
[00:46:04.213 - 00:46:05.175] Speaker 1: You have trained yourself.
[00:46:05.275 - 00:46:06.717] Speaker 1: No, there is nothing.
[00:46:06.737 - 00:46:09.581] Speaker 2: What is it?
[00:46:09.601 - 00:46:09.782] Speaker 2: Think.
[00:46:09.862 - 00:46:12.446] Speaker 2: Insecurity, let's dissect it.
[00:46:12.466 - 00:46:13.728] Speaker 2: What are insecurities?
[00:46:13.748 - 00:46:17.874] Speaker 1: I don't know.
[00:46:18.146 - 00:46:20.329] Speaker 1: It can be on the face, the way I talk.
[00:46:20.770 - 00:46:21.531] Speaker 2: I can't change that.
[00:46:21.551 - 00:46:24.516] Speaker 2: It can't be my rhinoplasty, it can't be my face lift.
[00:46:24.576 - 00:46:26.880] Speaker 1: And... Information.
[00:46:27.781 - 00:46:30.345] Speaker 1: I am less intelligent than someone.
[00:46:30.365 - 00:46:37.857] Speaker 2: I don't have that kind of self-conceit.
[00:46:37.877 - 00:46:39.880] Speaker 2: Not everyone is intelligent.
[00:46:39.900 - 00:46:46.450] Speaker 2: But if you have the capacity to keep learning, that means you are intelligent enough to know that you are not completely informed.
[00:46:47.394 - 00:46:50.057] Speaker 1: Okay, I'll ask this in another way but what's your biggest nightmare?
[00:46:50.177 - 00:46:50.657] Speaker 1: Tell me that.
[00:46:52.639 - 00:46:56.663] Speaker 1: As an actor and as a politician, what will be your nightmare if it ever happened?
[00:46:57.283 - 00:46:58.825] Speaker 2: I don't want it to be prophetic.
[00:46:59.606 - 00:47:02.348] Speaker 2: I was very taken aback the way Vijay Rupani died.
[00:47:04.390 - 00:47:05.191] Speaker 2: In the Ahmedabad.
[00:47:06.792 - 00:47:09.995] Speaker 2: I knew him for 25 years, 22 years.
[00:47:11.657 - 00:47:13.499] Speaker 2: I know Bhavi, Anjali Bhavi.
[00:47:16.081 - 00:47:17.042] Speaker 2: So the way he died
[00:47:17.442 - 00:47:18.323] Speaker 2: along with the rest.
[00:47:21.348 - 00:47:21.969] Speaker 1: That's a nightmare?
[00:47:22.529 - 00:47:23.611] Speaker 2: No, it's not a nightmare.
[00:47:23.751 - 00:47:24.833] Speaker 1: Does that scare you a lot?
[00:47:25.434 - 00:47:26.816] Speaker 1: Most people don't even think about it.
[00:47:29.099 - 00:47:29.620] Speaker 2: I knew him.
[00:47:31.963 - 00:47:36.991] Speaker 2: I saw the photographs of the kids who were there, you know, going with their parents to start a new life.
[00:47:39.835 - 00:47:44.882] Speaker 2: So I think the death of somebody I know in that
[00:47:48.482 - 00:47:49.263] Speaker 2: was so close.
[00:47:50.844 - 00:47:53.027] Speaker 2: Because what do you do to Bhabhi when you see her?
[00:47:55.309 - 00:47:59.734] Speaker 2: I mean, I've seen, people have seen him as Chief Minister, politician, blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:01.235 - 00:48:05.319] Speaker 2: See, my life in BJP has been lived as somebody who's a part of people's families.
[00:48:05.720 - 00:48:06.861] Speaker 1: Yeah.
[00:48:06.881 - 00:48:12.226] Speaker 2: If I would go to Rajkot, Vijay Bhai will say, Anjali, Smriti is here, her work is done, take her to play golf.
[00:48:12.827 - 00:48:14.629] Speaker 2: Bhabhi would always say, come on, Smriti, what do you want to eat?
[00:48:15.309 - 00:48:15.890] Speaker 2: What do you want to do?
[00:48:17.602 - 00:48:20.185] Speaker 2: You see Amit Shah as the Home Minister.
[00:48:20.866 - 00:48:23.488] Speaker 2: We see Bhabhi.
[00:48:24.369 - 00:48:27.173] Speaker 2: Give a small example, Arjun Meghwale is a Law Minister right now.
[00:48:28.194 - 00:48:29.495] Speaker 2: His wife is in Bikaner.
[00:48:29.515 - 00:48:32.739] Speaker 2: He knows that I like a toffee that is available in Bikaner.
[00:48:32.759 - 00:48:35.862] Speaker 2: For Bhabhi Holi, for Smriti.
[00:48:36.623 - 00:48:37.684] Speaker 2: These are relationships.
[00:48:38.265 - 00:48:39.606] Speaker 2: Suddenly to see it go.
[00:48:43.751 - 00:48:46.674] Speaker 2: So that, I think,
[00:48:47.394 - 00:48:48.335] Speaker 2: has kind of...
[00:48:49.737 - 00:48:50.839] Speaker 2: It's not a nightmare.
[00:48:52.461 - 00:48:55.746] Speaker 2: And it is an oxymoron because nobody is going to inform and then go.
[00:48:57.428 - 00:48:58.990] Speaker 2: So the eventuality of it.
[00:48:59.491 - 00:49:02.034] Speaker 2: You... Everyone teaches us everything.
[00:49:02.054 - 00:49:03.797] Speaker 1: Are you scared of this?
[00:49:03.837 - 00:49:05.159] Speaker 2: I am not scared.
[00:49:05.179 - 00:49:06.200] Speaker 2: I don't know, maybe I am scared.
[00:49:07.742 - 00:49:10.126] Speaker 2: That I'll walk in and what if mom doesn't wake up?
[00:49:12.088 - 00:49:13.650] Speaker 2: I am calling what if dad doesn't wake up?
[00:49:15.413 - 00:49:16.274] Speaker 2: Now that is...
[00:49:17.858 - 00:49:18.899] Speaker 1: That's everybody's fear.
[00:49:23.324 - 00:49:24.945] Speaker 1: That's almost everybody's fear.
[00:49:24.965 - 00:49:25.386] Speaker 2: That's it.
[00:49:27.047 - 00:49:27.948] Speaker 2: I know it's going to happen.
[00:49:29.790 - 00:49:30.371] Speaker 2: I'm going to go.
[00:49:30.411 - 00:49:32.713] Speaker 2: My parents are going to go.
[00:49:32.733 - 00:49:37.778] Speaker 2: Right now, I mean, I came last night before having this conversation.
[00:49:37.858 - 00:49:40.301] Speaker 2: My sister was leaving for overseas.
[00:49:40.541 - 00:49:41.923] Speaker 2: We both don't tell each other.
[00:49:41.963 - 00:49:45.266] Speaker 2: The only reason she wants to come is to see Amma.
[00:49:47.842 - 00:49:50.646] Speaker 2: She's going for just three weeks.
[00:49:53.289 - 00:49:53.850] Speaker 2: But what if?
[00:49:55.332 - 00:49:56.033] Speaker 2: We don't see Ma.
[00:49:57.315 - 00:49:58.056] Speaker 2: So it is...
[00:49:59.618 - 00:50:03.743] Speaker 2: I do childish things like tell my mother, you sleep in the middle of the bed.
[00:50:03.763 - 00:50:06.167] Speaker 2: And my mother just look at me, what?
[00:50:07.829 - 00:50:10.432] Speaker 2: We call a child, that the child should fall down.
[00:50:10.452 - 00:50:17.682] Speaker 2: I call my 75 years old mother, you sleep in the middle of the bed.
[00:50:18.818 - 00:50:19.639] Speaker 2: He used to humor me.
[00:50:19.799 - 00:50:20.980] Speaker 2: I then panicked.
[00:50:21.401 - 00:50:24.364] Speaker 2: I used to sleep in between the bed.
[00:50:24.824 - 00:50:25.865] Speaker 2: That's a very human.
[00:50:28.748 - 00:50:31.631] Speaker 2: You call up my father one day on a Sunday.
[00:50:31.792 - 00:50:32.933] Speaker 2: He works a lot.
[00:50:33.093 - 00:50:36.156] Speaker 2: He is a workaholic.
[00:50:36.537 - 00:50:40.981] Speaker 2: He slept for 4-5 hours on a Sunday.
[00:50:42.263 - 00:50:45.586] Speaker 2: In those 4 hours, I must have done 50 calls on his phone.
[00:50:48.002 - 00:50:49.223] Speaker 2: He was somewhere in Punjab.
[00:50:49.464 - 00:50:52.227] Speaker 2: I had somebody go to his house and wake him up.
[00:50:53.708 - 00:50:56.331] Speaker 2: And he was like, are you mad?
[00:50:56.351 - 00:50:57.372] Speaker 1: He was sleeping.
[00:50:57.392 - 00:50:58.413] Speaker 2: He was sleeping.
[00:50:58.433 - 00:50:59.334] Speaker 2: It was a Sunday.
[00:50:59.354 - 00:51:01.817] Speaker 1: Okay, I'm tempted to ask you a very vanilla question.
[00:51:03.239 - 00:51:08.184] Speaker 1: What is it like to be the inner circle of top leadership in the country?
[00:51:08.885 - 00:51:10.446] Speaker 2: There is no inner circle.
[00:51:10.466 - 00:51:12.148] Speaker 1: PM Modi and you were in a circle.
[00:51:12.348 - 00:51:14.311] Speaker 1: Like they are like 10-20 people.
[00:51:14.331 - 00:51:15.512] Speaker 2: PM Modi is the circle.
[00:51:15.672 - 00:51:16.072] Speaker 1: That's it.
[00:51:16.112 - 00:51:17.554] Speaker 1: What is it like to be in that circle?
[00:51:18.018 - 00:51:19.200] Speaker 2: PM Modi is the circle.
[00:51:20.621 - 00:51:21.402] Speaker 2: There's nobody else.
[00:51:22.023 - 00:51:27.090] Speaker 2: The other myth that people propagate about him is, I advise them, I am here.
[00:51:28.331 - 00:51:30.774] Speaker 2: Whoever has told you this is just blatantly lying.
[00:51:34.179 - 00:51:34.599] Speaker 2: There's him.
[00:51:35.541 - 00:51:36.702] Speaker 2: He will disseminate work.
[00:51:36.802 - 00:51:37.223] Speaker 2: That's it.
[00:51:37.343 - 00:51:38.224] Speaker 2: You work, you report.
[00:51:38.264 - 00:51:38.645] Speaker 2: That's it.
[00:51:39.946 - 00:51:40.827] Speaker 2: There's no antarash.
[00:51:42.289 - 00:51:43.331] Speaker 2: There's no inner circle.
[00:51:45.193 - 00:51:46.034] Speaker 2: I think I am...
[00:51:47.138 - 00:51:49.901] Speaker 2: I'm the way I am a lot also because of how I've watched him.
[00:51:50.702 - 00:51:51.463] Speaker 1: What have you watched in?
[00:51:52.324 - 00:51:55.227] Speaker 2: Very precise, very professional, very direct.
[00:51:56.328 - 00:51:57.049] Speaker 2: No nonsense.
[00:51:58.050 - 00:51:59.692] Speaker 2: Does not create small talk.
[00:51:59.972 - 00:52:00.313] Speaker 2: Nothing.
[00:52:02.014 - 00:52:03.096] Speaker 2: Hard core work.
[00:52:03.676 - 00:52:09.302] Speaker 2: You would presume that he, you know, will have an entourage which feeds him stuff.
[00:52:10.504 - 00:52:16.210] Speaker 2: You would be amazed by how much he is self-driven, how much he has
[00:52:16.386 - 00:52:20.351] Speaker 2: read, experienced and brought forth on his own.
[00:52:20.952 - 00:52:28.421] Speaker 2: What he does is he will take the best of every field and he will say X, Y, Z.
[00:52:30.403 - 00:52:31.584] Speaker 2: He will tell me this is the issue.
[00:52:32.305 - 00:52:33.927] Speaker 2: This is the outcome I want.
[00:52:33.947 - 00:52:34.728] Speaker 2: And then he let me be.
[00:52:36.130 - 00:52:37.492] Speaker 2: And that is the best way to learn.
[00:52:38.112 - 00:52:39.494] Speaker 2: That is one of the best bosses to have.
[00:52:39.955 - 00:52:42.978] Speaker 2: Not somebody who's looking away like he doesn't know all that.
[00:52:43.839 - 00:52:44.019] Unknown: True.
[00:52:44.520 - 00:52:46.162] Speaker 2: I worked with him 22 years.
[00:52:47.810 - 00:52:49.792] Speaker 2: I worked with him when he was Chief Minister as well.
[00:52:51.094 - 00:52:51.775] Speaker 2: Same pattern.
[00:52:53.597 - 00:52:55.459] Speaker 2: This work has been given to Smriti.
[00:52:55.479 - 00:52:56.421] Speaker 2: This outcome will come.
[00:52:57.081 - 00:52:57.682] Speaker 2: Leave her alone.
[00:52:58.323 - 00:52:59.745] Speaker 1: How will that Smriti come?
[00:52:59.765 - 00:53:00.986] Speaker 2: She will take care of Smriti.
[00:53:02.288 - 00:53:06.533] Speaker 2: And there is nothing more empowering for the lack of a better word than that.
[00:53:07.514 - 00:53:11.619] Speaker 2: When the Prime Minister of the country knows or your leadership knows.
[00:53:11.639 - 00:53:16.946] Speaker 1: You have worked with Atal Bihari as well.
[00:53:17.186 - 00:53:18.208] Speaker 1: And you work with PM Modi.
[00:53:18.228 - 00:53:19.269] Speaker 1: What are the differences?
[00:53:20.612 - 00:53:21.834] Speaker 2: We call him Babji at home.
[00:53:22.735 - 00:53:26.141] Speaker 2: So he was a philosophical poet politician.
[00:53:27.984 - 00:53:37.299] Speaker 2: My interface with him was very different from Prime Minister Modi because I was a Karekarta who found a blessed place amongst his family.
[00:53:38.841 - 00:53:41.746] Speaker 2: So he and I never interacted as though, you know, Prime Minister and
[00:53:43.682 - 00:53:47.686] Speaker 2: A individual who's supposed to deliver on a particular project of acid.
[00:53:48.207 - 00:53:49.348] Speaker 2: So I've seen a different side of him.
[00:53:49.629 - 00:53:51.431] Speaker 1: But what are the differences between both of them?
[00:53:52.592 - 00:53:53.373] Speaker 1: In personality?
[00:53:55.735 - 00:53:57.497] Speaker 2: Prime Minister Modi is 24x7 driven.
[00:53:58.258 - 00:54:00.080] Speaker 1: You haven't met anyone else who's like that?
[00:54:00.621 - 00:54:00.801] Speaker 2: No.
[00:54:01.902 - 00:54:05.646] Speaker 2: That man is all work every minute of the day.
[00:54:07.969 - 00:54:11.713] Speaker 2: I have never seen him like, as you guys say, chill.
[00:54:11.953 - 00:54:12.434] Speaker 2: No.
[00:54:14.338 - 00:54:17.162] Unknown: He is very clear.
[00:54:17.282 - 00:54:18.244] Speaker 2: It's a huge country.
[00:54:18.264 - 00:54:20.046] Speaker 2: 1.4 billion people.
[00:54:20.226 - 00:54:21.268] Speaker 2: We don't have time to waste.
[00:54:21.628 - 00:54:22.429] Speaker 2: Very clear on that.
[00:54:24.733 - 00:54:28.017] Speaker 2: Babji was somebody I had seen 25 year old.
[00:54:30.060 - 00:54:32.343] Speaker 2: He would give you that space to culturally evolve.
[00:54:32.504 - 00:54:33.946] Speaker 2: So I've seen a different facet of him.
[00:54:36.529 - 00:54:37.631] Speaker 1: You joined in 2003.
[00:54:37.991 - 00:54:38.192] Speaker 2: Yeah.
[00:54:39.033 - 00:54:39.794] Speaker 1: And then?
[00:54:41.122 - 00:54:43.585] Speaker 1: You got your major responsibility in 2014.
[00:54:43.645 - 00:54:45.427] Speaker 1: I mean, cabinet major.
[00:54:45.968 - 00:54:47.369] Speaker 2: Organizationally I was in.
[00:54:48.070 - 00:54:48.871] Speaker 2: You're from Indore.
[00:54:48.991 - 00:54:51.534] Speaker 2: So, Tai Ji is from Indore, right?
[00:54:51.554 - 00:54:52.055] Speaker 1: Yes, I know.
[00:54:52.255 - 00:54:54.337] Speaker 2: So, me and Tai again go back 20 years.
[00:54:54.898 - 00:54:55.799] Speaker 2: So, I've worked in Indore.
[00:54:55.859 - 00:54:56.720] Speaker 2: I've worked in your city.
[00:54:57.101 - 00:55:01.145] Speaker 2: So, Ahile Bhai Holkar Ji ki jo palki chalti hai, I'm one of those people who's done the palki also.
[00:55:01.546 - 00:55:03.448] Speaker 1: You were all everywhere.
[00:55:03.468 - 00:55:05.471] Speaker 1: I know you have done so much work.
[00:55:05.911 - 00:55:06.672] Speaker 1: Star pracharaki.
[00:55:06.732 - 00:55:08.434] Speaker 2: Apart from that, I've been the...
[00:55:08.546 - 00:55:11.729] Speaker 2: Vice President of the Youth Wing here in Maharashtra.
[00:55:12.671 - 00:55:14.493] Speaker 2: Twice, I've been a National Secretary.
[00:55:14.953 - 00:55:16.375] Speaker 2: I've worked with five presidents.
[00:55:17.055 - 00:55:20.679] Speaker 2: J P Nanda, who's current president, Amit Bhai, before him.
[00:55:20.880 - 00:55:22.141] Speaker 2: I've worked with Rajnath Singh.
[00:55:22.702 - 00:55:25.605] Speaker 2: I've worked with Nitin Gadkari and Venki Anand, Vice Presidents.
[00:55:26.946 - 00:55:30.170] Speaker 1: How do they test you before giving you any major responsibility?
[00:55:30.190 - 00:55:30.891] Speaker 1: Is there a process?
[00:55:31.551 - 00:55:34.034] Speaker 2: I think 2003 is when my first test.
[00:55:34.530 - 00:55:39.938] Speaker 2: was given by a politician in Maharashtra who is no longer amongst us, Gopinath Munde.
[00:55:40.820 - 00:55:47.130] Speaker 2: So, Munde Ji was of the opinion that everyone does social work.
[00:55:47.190 - 00:55:51.957] Speaker 2: If you want to change, then become a policy maker.
[00:55:53.580 - 00:55:55.302] Speaker 2: Because this is a conversation he and I had.
[00:55:55.343 - 00:55:59.469] Speaker 2: And I was working in Talasuri, here in the outskirts of Maharashtra.
[00:55:59.489 - 00:56:02.674] Speaker 2: And he was like, okay, everyone does it.
[00:56:02.818 - 00:56:04.521] Speaker 2: Everyone has to change the society.
[00:56:04.541 - 00:56:08.027] Speaker 2: But if the tectonic shift comes from policy, then it's part of the electoral politics.
[00:56:08.728 - 00:56:11.172] Speaker 2: So what is the one thing that you want to do?
[00:56:11.192 - 00:56:14.517] Speaker 2: Now, 2003, there were not many young girls in Yuvamurcha.
[00:56:14.577 - 00:56:16.040] Speaker 2: It was mostly a male bastion.
[00:56:16.621 - 00:56:18.784] Speaker 2: So I said, why shouldn't girls come?
[00:56:18.905 - 00:56:22.811] Speaker 2: Youth wing means youth is as much girls as men.
[00:56:23.793 - 00:56:28.080] Speaker 2: You know, women have political ambitions, even if they are 18 years old or 20 years old.
[00:56:28.100 - 00:56:29.522] Speaker 2: So why shouldn't they be?
[00:56:29.602 - 00:56:32.765] Speaker 2: He said, okay, from the point of view of the organization, we are at 55 districts.
[00:56:32.845 - 00:56:36.709] Speaker 2: So one is administrative districts as articulated by government.
[00:56:36.789 - 00:56:38.951] Speaker 2: One is from the point of view of the BJP.
[00:56:39.391 - 00:56:41.673] Speaker 2: So he said, 55 districts.
[00:56:41.693 - 00:56:45.998] Speaker 2: Can you find one female leader who is in that age group?
[00:56:46.838 - 00:56:49.040] Speaker 2: So I said, yeah.
[00:56:49.541 - 00:56:49.661] Speaker 2: Okay.
[00:56:49.681 - 00:56:50.522] Speaker 2: Fine.
[00:56:51.022 - 00:56:51.503] Speaker 2: Find me.
[00:56:51.523 - 00:56:53.004] Speaker 2: He says, we've been trying to find.
[00:56:53.765 - 00:56:55.787] Speaker 2: This is your six month target.
[00:56:55.987 - 00:56:56.227] Speaker 2: Fine.
[00:56:57.428 - 00:56:59.090] Speaker 2: Went from village to village to village.
[00:56:59.394 - 00:57:00.555] Speaker 2: across all districts.
[00:57:01.657 - 00:57:08.385] Speaker 2: We found, and 50, Devendra Fadnavis, the current Chief Minister, was Vice President with me at that time.
[00:57:10.167 - 00:57:21.221] Speaker 2: So two, three of us got together, and across 55 spots, we found 55 young ladies who could take the issue of women leadership in youth wing forward in 2003.
[00:57:21.241 - 00:57:28.210] Speaker 2: And I remember month five, I requested Mundeji to meet all 55.
[00:57:29.090 - 00:57:34.481] Speaker 2: He was like, that set like the template key.
[00:57:37.046 - 00:57:38.929] Speaker 1: So then they keep testing you again and again.
[00:57:38.949 - 00:57:41.655] Speaker 2: They don't test you then everybody's assigned a project.
[00:57:42.076 - 00:57:43.799] Speaker 2: Teams are assigned.
[00:57:43.819 - 00:57:51.474] Speaker 2: Then you fulfill the standards, benchmarks or outcomes that are expected of those projects.
[00:57:51.554 - 00:57:58.625] Speaker 2: Three was also when Vasundhara Raje for the first time was presented as Rajasthan Chief Ministerial candidate from the BJP.
[00:57:59.106 - 00:58:00.949] Speaker 2: So Pramod Mahajan at that time was alive.
[00:58:00.989 - 00:58:04.575] Speaker 2: So he had been deputed to make her fight Rajasthan.
[00:58:05.496 - 00:58:19.218] Speaker 2: And there's a group of hundred boys who had gone to kind of assist, you know, we do the runners, the ones who would set up offices, the ones who would be a part of the syphological or statistical team, who will do local prachar.
[00:58:19.426 - 00:58:21.068] Speaker 2: Who will do coordination in the office?
[00:58:21.088 - 00:58:22.650] Speaker 2: Which politician will go where?
[00:58:23.971 - 00:58:26.254] Speaker 2: Who will meet communities and all that jazz?
[00:58:26.454 - 00:58:29.598] Speaker 2: Out of 100 boys, I was one of them.
[00:58:30.178 - 00:58:31.740] Speaker 2: That's the only exception.
[00:58:31.760 - 00:58:33.382] Speaker 1: 100 in one or 99 in plus one?
[00:58:33.402 - 00:58:33.582] Speaker 2: Yeah.
[00:58:34.924 - 00:58:37.427] Speaker 2: So, it's like you're dispatched many a times as a part of a group.
[00:58:38.408 - 00:58:44.435] Speaker 2: And obviously, if you're politically very attuned or sharp, you will learn.
[00:58:44.455 - 00:58:47.378] Speaker 2: And you've watched on every assignment.
[00:58:48.002 - 00:58:52.088] Speaker 2: So you're given the next assignment on the basis of how well you've done in the current one.
[00:58:53.270 - 00:59:00.241] Speaker 2: If you're lethargic, if you're not a team player, if you, because that's life and death, right?
[00:59:00.982 - 00:59:04.728] Speaker 2: It's a small kind of time window where you have to do the best.
[00:59:06.511 - 00:59:09.535] Speaker 2: So at that time, there are enough people.
[00:59:12.440 - 00:59:16.466] Speaker 2: After let's say an assignment, elders do sit and do samiksha.
[00:59:17.538 - 00:59:18.459] Speaker 2: that who did what.
[00:59:18.479 - 00:59:19.441] Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying.
[00:59:19.701 - 00:59:22.365] Speaker 2: BJP is not one of those run-of-the-mill.
[00:59:23.066 - 00:59:24.568] Speaker 2: Okay, now you've come to be a leader.
[00:59:24.688 - 00:59:24.849] Speaker 2: No.
[00:59:25.510 - 00:59:26.852] Speaker 2: There is Samiksha.
[00:59:26.892 - 00:59:40.892] Speaker 2: In Samiksha, your attitude at work with people, people outside as citizens, people within the organization, even that much is seen from a subtle point of view.
[00:59:40.912 - 00:59:42.034] Speaker 1: Do you get trained as well?
[00:59:42.054 - 00:59:43.896] Speaker 1: Is there like a formal training?
[00:59:43.916 - 00:59:45.138] Speaker 2: If you're sharp, you're trained on the job.
[00:59:45.410 - 00:59:47.973] Speaker 2: It's a strain, trained on the job.
[00:59:47.993 - 00:59:50.496] Speaker 1: There is nothing that can be changed.
[00:59:50.536 - 00:59:54.881] Speaker 1: Few leaders will make sure that we want the next leadership to come up and we will train them specifically.
[00:59:55.782 - 00:59:56.422] Speaker 2: This is training.
[00:59:57.504 - 00:59:57.964] Speaker 1: On the job.
[00:59:58.004 - 00:59:59.726] Speaker 2: This is training, on the job.
[00:59:59.826 - 01:00:08.896] Speaker 2: Like when Narendra Modi had this whole program Sad Bhavna ka as Chief Minister.
[01:00:10.338 - 01:00:14.002] Speaker 2: He had decided Press Interface Shruti Garegi.
[01:00:15.234 - 01:00:43.442] Speaker 2: So every leader, so let's say when I became Gujarat MP for the first time, in half an hour of me coming back to my, you know, guest house, after I had filled my nomination, I mean the result was not even declared, I filled my nomination from then Chief Minister Modi's office, this whole big pile of papers and books came, that you have to study this, this session of parliament will come, these are issues of Gujarat,
[01:00:43.618 - 01:00:48.303] Speaker 2: and please represent the state well.
[01:00:48.984 - 01:00:51.406] Speaker 2: These are the, what can you do additionally?
[01:00:52.047 - 01:00:53.568] Speaker 2: So you would study all those points.
[01:00:54.009 - 01:00:55.250] Speaker 2: You would speak in parliament.
[01:00:55.370 - 01:00:56.451] Speaker 2: You would learn everything.
[01:00:56.952 - 01:01:05.060] Speaker 2: And then you would say, so what if I go to XYZ, or XYZ specialist and push this agenda for the state and the people.
[01:01:05.621 - 01:01:10.546] Speaker 2: So you would come back and you would report, I've done excess.
[01:01:10.818 - 01:01:18.990] Speaker 2: Parliamentary obviously, there is enough, the landscape is such, that whatever you have done in parliamentary, it is recorded.
[01:01:19.551 - 01:01:21.634] Speaker 2: Even in Nikhit and AVB.
[01:01:22.595 - 01:01:23.437] Speaker 2: So you can't lie.
[01:01:23.457 - 01:01:28.144] Speaker 2: This is not the place where you have made a mistake or not.
[01:01:28.384 - 01:01:30.988] Speaker 2: There is a record of your engagement.
[01:01:31.509 - 01:01:33.111] Speaker 2: So you are tested on that.
[01:01:33.492 - 01:01:33.972] Speaker 2: Everything.
[01:01:34.473 - 01:01:40.562] Speaker 2: Suppose you were sent somewhere to do press conference or to do propaganda.
[01:01:40.802 - 01:01:47.869] Speaker 2: So as soon as you get off the plane, what is your nature with that local worker?
[01:01:47.889 - 01:01:50.312] Speaker 2: We have a feedback system.
[01:01:50.332 - 01:01:52.734] Speaker 2: We take feedback from each other.
[01:01:52.754 - 01:01:55.077] Speaker 2: We do some research.
[01:01:55.557 - 01:01:58.360] Speaker 2: See, you presume that a politician's ego will come.
[01:01:58.380 - 01:02:00.182] Speaker 2: How dare you say that I did good or not?
[01:02:00.282 - 01:02:01.864] Speaker 2: It's not like that.
[01:02:01.884 - 01:02:08.210] Speaker 2: In BJP, after getting off the plane, all the workers I had worked with, they were all workers.
[01:02:10.306 - 01:02:18.620] Speaker 2: And they have to have the freedom in their engagement with you enough to say, Didi, this is how it should have been.
[01:02:18.740 - 01:02:24.350] Speaker 2: Like today, the head of our media cell, Anil Baloni, he's also from Uttarakhand, he's an MP.
[01:02:25.792 - 01:02:28.497] Speaker 2: Even today, if I have to talk something, I will call Anil.
[01:02:29.579 - 01:02:31.181] Speaker 2: Anil, do you have any point of view?
[01:02:32.724 - 01:02:34.888] Speaker 2: It's not always your point of view, it's party's point of view.
[01:02:35.088 - 01:02:36.210] Speaker 2: True.
[01:02:36.546 - 01:02:40.111] Speaker 2: At times, it's also individual experiences that you'll want to leverage.
[01:02:40.211 - 01:02:42.894] Speaker 2: Anil is from Uttarakhand.
[01:02:42.914 - 01:02:47.660] Speaker 2: His co-convener Sanjay Mayuk is from Bihar.
[01:02:47.680 - 01:02:51.946] Speaker 2: So if I am going to speak in Bihar, or if I am going to speak on the same topic, Sanjay, what do you think?
[01:02:51.966 - 01:02:53.989] Speaker 2: Sister, this will happen, that will happen.
[01:02:54.009 - 01:02:56.752] Speaker 2: So it's a conversation every time.
[01:02:56.772 - 01:02:57.673] Speaker 2: It's a team work.
[01:02:57.834 - 01:03:00.497] Speaker 2: It is not something that Neta came, said it and left.
[01:03:01.478 - 01:03:02.419] Speaker 1: No, it doesn't happen like that.
[01:03:03.361 - 01:03:04.402] Speaker 2: For some it may happen.
[01:03:05.026 - 01:03:10.754] Speaker 2: I have not evolved as a politician because of anything else but this method of working.
[01:03:10.774 - 01:03:20.087] Speaker 2: Because when you present yourself to anybody and you're presenting yourself as a BJP person, you're not affecting only your chances of how you're perceived.
[01:03:21.029 - 01:03:24.594] Speaker 2: You're also affecting the chances of how your party, your leadership will be perceived.
[01:03:25.115 - 01:03:25.315] Speaker 2: True.
[01:03:25.615 - 01:03:26.657] Speaker 2: So you have to be mindful of that.
[01:03:27.077 - 01:03:27.318] Unknown: True.
[01:03:28.119 - 01:03:33.106] Speaker 2: Like you went to that program of the government, of the creators.
[01:03:34.210 - 01:03:36.813] Speaker 2: My training is such that I will watch every creator.
[01:03:37.294 - 01:03:38.595] Speaker 2: So that has nothing to do with me.
[01:03:39.456 - 01:03:41.899] Speaker 2: So do you also watch things which have nothing to do with you?
[01:03:43.001 - 01:03:46.025] Speaker 1: But you would see my introduction which has nothing to do with you or anything.
[01:03:46.365 - 01:03:46.565] Speaker 2: Yeah.
[01:03:47.206 - 01:03:50.009] Speaker 2: Because I will then study how you perceive the Prime Minister.
[01:03:51.712 - 01:03:52.292] Speaker 2: But that's me.
[01:03:53.273 - 01:03:56.557] Speaker 2: That's not party training.
[01:03:56.578 - 01:03:57.138] Speaker 1: Interesting.
[01:03:57.639 - 01:04:03.506] Speaker 2: Every email that will come to me or everything that is written about me, Facebook, Twitter,
[01:04:04.098 - 01:04:05.500] Speaker 2: Instagram.
[01:04:05.520 - 01:04:06.121] Speaker 2: I will know.
[01:04:08.124 - 01:04:08.604] Speaker 2: Personally.
[01:04:09.265 - 01:04:12.029] Speaker 2: Even I do not have an inner circle.
[01:04:14.512 - 01:04:15.474] Speaker 1: That's incredible.
[01:04:16.095 - 01:04:17.797] Speaker 1: How do you keep up with these things?
[01:04:17.817 - 01:04:19.519] Speaker 2: Because there's enough time in the day to keep up.
[01:04:21.843 - 01:04:25.247] Speaker 1: Typical peak performer person saying this.
[01:04:25.287 - 01:04:27.210] Speaker 1: That's what you all say.
[01:04:27.230 - 01:04:32.097] Speaker 2: Because everybody will only appreciate you if they personally resonate with you.
[01:04:32.618 - 01:04:32.978] Speaker 1: Agreed.
[01:04:33.474 - 01:04:36.838] Speaker 2: People hate to go through hierarchies to reach you.
[01:04:37.880 - 01:04:45.109] Speaker 2: And you have to give people the respect of picking up the phone when they call and not have some assistant get it to you.
[01:04:46.490 - 01:04:49.454] Speaker 2: People sometimes flex it as a power play.
[01:04:49.494 - 01:04:51.517] Speaker 2: That is stupidity as far as I'm concerned.
[01:04:52.778 - 01:04:59.447] Speaker 2: It is much more warm when the person you're calling, even if they've become minister, can pick up the phone and say yes.
[01:04:59.467 - 01:04:59.707] Speaker 2: Right?
[01:05:00.288 - 01:05:01.970] Speaker 2: Because whatever goes up will come down.
[01:05:03.778 - 01:05:04.038] Speaker 1: True.
[01:05:04.980 - 01:05:05.200] Speaker 1: True.
[01:05:05.541 - 01:05:08.165] Speaker 2: And the only thing people remember is how you make them feel.
[01:05:09.807 - 01:05:10.268] Speaker 1: Nothing else.
[01:05:10.568 - 01:05:11.550] Speaker 2: Nothing else.
[01:05:11.570 - 01:05:17.278] Speaker 1: When you have done so much, like you have operated at that level, will you enjoy acting again?
[01:05:18.320 - 01:05:18.881] Speaker 1: You are coming back.
[01:05:19.261 - 01:05:21.384] Speaker 2: Can your life be only about one thing?
[01:05:22.065 - 01:05:24.769] Speaker 1: No, but now will you be able to accept that?
[01:05:25.871 - 01:05:26.272] Speaker 1: Will you enjoy?
[01:05:29.216 - 01:05:30.999] Speaker 2: What is the fun?
[01:05:31.019 - 01:05:31.820] Speaker 1: You tell me.
[01:05:31.840 - 01:05:33.202] Speaker 2: I am saying the same, what is your language?
[01:05:33.826 - 01:05:36.009] Speaker 2: You are younger than me, right?
[01:05:36.049 - 01:05:38.291] Speaker 1: So, tell me what is the tradition?
[01:05:38.712 - 01:05:39.373] Speaker 2: I don't want to learn.
[01:05:39.393 - 01:05:40.714] Speaker 2: So, what will I learn?
[01:05:40.734 - 01:05:40.895] Speaker 2: Tell me.
[01:05:42.617 - 01:05:43.157] Speaker 1: With acting?
[01:05:45.800 - 01:05:46.201] Speaker 1: I don't know.
[01:05:46.541 - 01:05:52.288] Speaker 2: Now... You said that I have a persona, intimidating.
[01:05:52.348 - 01:05:56.714] Speaker 2: Okay, now think that when I will look like Tulsi, Meer will be shouting at me.
[01:05:56.874 - 01:06:01.479] Speaker 1: Identity will be thrashed many times in the eyes of people.
[01:06:02.601 - 01:06:03.182] Speaker 2: It won't be yours.
[01:06:03.202 - 01:06:03.602] Speaker 2: I was doing a scene.
[01:06:04.482 - 01:06:07.386] Speaker 2: There is a discussion about my weight, about Tulsi.
[01:06:07.406 - 01:06:12.552] Speaker 2: Yes, see how fat he is.
[01:06:15.676 - 01:06:17.899] Speaker 2: Which means you are teaching people comfort around you.
[01:06:19.181 - 01:06:20.343] Speaker 2: To say this, one.
[01:06:21.524 - 01:06:23.447] Speaker 2: But what do you convey to the larger audience?
[01:06:27.452 - 01:06:28.854] Speaker 2: Body shaming.
[01:06:28.874 - 01:06:32.338] Speaker 2: It is so natural for us to do it to people, especially women.
[01:06:34.530 - 01:06:41.299] Speaker 2: So am I conveying a very hard truth in a very, very dramatically acceptable way?
[01:06:42.961 - 01:06:46.105] Speaker 2: This is what I fought for all my life from a policy perspective.
[01:06:46.125 - 01:06:46.926] Speaker 2: They don't do this.
[01:06:47.787 - 01:06:53.414] Speaker 2: We know better how to judge women and not by how their bodies look.
[01:06:53.434 - 01:06:56.859] Speaker 2: But can I relay this information to a larger audience?
[01:06:56.919 - 01:06:57.239] Speaker 2: I can.
[01:06:58.441 - 01:07:02.065] Speaker 2: Will I have to take a beating for it myself to relay that information?
[01:07:02.245 - 01:07:02.706] Speaker 2: Maybe.
[01:07:03.938 - 01:07:05.400] Speaker 2: But what is the penultimate goal?
[01:07:05.461 - 01:07:06.763] Speaker 2: Relay that information.
[01:07:08.926 - 01:07:10.369] Speaker 1: But do you think people will accept this?
[01:07:11.050 - 01:07:12.973] Speaker 1: Now they have seen you as Didi.
[01:07:13.694 - 01:07:15.197] Speaker 2: That is where the acting comes in.
[01:07:17.821 - 01:07:21.507] Speaker 2: That is where the acting and the writing comes in.
[01:07:21.527 - 01:07:23.951] Speaker 2: So what you see now is just me.
[01:07:24.572 - 01:07:27.698] Speaker 2: What you have seen is what Ekta thinks of the character.
[01:07:28.880 - 01:07:30.322] Speaker 1: Will people accept it?
[01:07:30.946 - 01:07:36.431] Speaker 2: If you didn't do it, you would have been sitting here today.
[01:07:36.451 - 01:07:38.594] Speaker 1: But now, like the way...
[01:07:38.614 - 01:07:41.216] Speaker 1: I would see or my parents would see you is very different.
[01:07:41.837 - 01:07:42.878] Speaker 1: Yeah.
[01:07:42.898 - 01:07:48.163] Speaker 1: And if they see the same Tulsi again, they'll be like... little... Added to the craft.
[01:07:48.183 - 01:07:54.549] Speaker 1: You're coming back because of the craft or you're coming back because... you just can't be idle or...
[01:07:54.569 - 01:07:55.170] Speaker 2: It's okay.
[01:07:56.231 - 01:07:57.412] Speaker 1: Like to be busy.
[01:07:57.572 - 01:07:57.893] Speaker 1: Okay.
[01:07:58.773 - 01:07:59.314] Speaker 2: It's okay.
[01:07:59.394 - 01:08:01.877] Speaker 2: I've been teaching for two years, I've been teaching at IIM.
[01:08:03.700 - 01:08:05.522] Speaker 2: As an adjunct faculty, I didn't tell anyone.
[01:08:05.542 - 01:08:07.465] Speaker 2: I was teaching when I was a cabinet minister.
[01:08:08.246 - 01:08:09.067] Speaker 1: I didn't tell anyone.
[01:08:09.087 - 01:08:09.628] Speaker 1: I didn't tell anyone.
[01:08:09.648 - 01:08:10.489] Speaker 1: I didn't even come for research.
[01:08:10.509 - 01:08:13.513] Speaker 2: You won't come.
[01:08:13.533 - 01:08:15.415] Speaker 2: I've just given a guest lecture in Berkeley.
[01:08:15.436 - 01:08:16.577] Speaker 2: With my professor.
[01:08:17.158 - 01:08:17.679] Speaker 2: Conjoined.
[01:08:18.359 - 01:08:19.000] Speaker 2: On FinTech.
[01:08:19.020 - 01:08:19.541] Speaker 2: Can you imagine?
[01:08:20.803 - 01:08:21.864] Speaker 1: I told you the story of FinTech.
[01:08:21.944 - 01:08:24.568] Speaker 2: No, but you have to go there to teach.
[01:08:24.588 - 01:08:27.031] Speaker 2: It's different to leave after studying.
[01:08:27.051 - 01:08:29.154] Speaker 1: Go there and teach.
[01:08:29.174 - 01:08:29.234] Unknown: No.
[01:08:29.346 - 01:08:31.388] Speaker 2: I have been teaching for two years.
[01:08:31.408 - 01:08:31.789] Speaker 2: No one knows.
[01:08:31.889 - 01:08:33.070] Speaker 1: So you are busy.
[01:08:34.792 - 01:08:35.734] Speaker 1: What's the real reason?
[01:08:35.754 - 01:08:37.936] Speaker 2: I run an alliance in World Economic Forum.
[01:08:37.956 - 01:08:40.119] Speaker 2: On gender.
[01:08:40.379 - 01:08:42.361] Speaker 2: I will send you to the house.
[01:08:42.381 - 01:08:43.423] Speaker 1: What are you talking about?
[01:08:43.443 - 01:08:44.364] Speaker 2: I have been running it for two years.
[01:08:45.625 - 01:08:46.126] Speaker 1: Nice.
[01:08:46.146 - 01:08:47.728] Speaker 1: This is not too public.
[01:08:48.729 - 01:08:49.710] Speaker 2: No one asked.
[01:08:50.591 - 01:08:52.914] Speaker 2: But it doesn't mean that I am not doing it.
[01:08:54.018 - 01:08:54.739] Speaker 1: What's the reality?
[01:08:54.759 - 01:08:55.240] Speaker 1: What do you think?
[01:08:55.260 - 01:08:56.481] Speaker 1: Why did you say yes to this?
[01:08:56.661 - 01:09:00.126] Speaker 2: I am the co-chair of the digital transformation of B20.
[01:09:00.266 - 01:09:01.768] Speaker 2: South Africa has nominated me.
[01:09:01.788 - 01:09:06.153] Speaker 2: I am with Commonwealth Secretariat in the 55 states, in the MOU.
[01:09:06.173 - 01:09:06.554] Speaker 2: I work there.
[01:09:06.574 - 01:09:09.537] Speaker 2: There is no limit to work.
[01:09:09.878 - 01:09:10.999] Speaker 1: Then why are you losing?
[01:09:11.019 - 01:09:11.620] Speaker 2: Experience.
[01:09:13.542 - 01:09:15.805] Speaker 2: Because you have to experience everything.
[01:09:15.825 - 01:09:20.551] Speaker 2: Nobody gets to re-experience from a new perspective the same life.
[01:09:21.673 - 01:09:22.834] Speaker 1: You are getting the opportunity.
[01:09:23.426 - 01:09:28.694] Speaker 2: If you ask Raj to go there and relive, will you relive separately?
[01:09:28.934 - 01:09:29.235] Speaker 1: 100%.
[01:09:29.475 - 01:09:29.635] Speaker 1: Then?
[01:09:29.695 - 01:09:34.322] Speaker 2: You are not getting a chance, I am getting one.
[01:09:34.342 - 01:09:34.442] Speaker 2: True.
[01:09:34.463 - 01:09:36.265] Speaker 2: I am getting one.
[01:09:36.285 - 01:09:39.790] Speaker 1: No, we started the conversation and that was left in the middle.
[01:09:40.872 - 01:09:43.135] Speaker 1: You said, and I want to end it like that.
[01:09:44.197 - 01:09:45.098] Speaker 1: Second last question.
[01:09:45.719 - 01:09:48.964] Speaker 1: On June 4, when it happened, you didn't feel anything.
[01:09:49.004 - 01:09:50.647] Speaker 1: When you lost the election, you felt nothing.
[01:09:51.328 - 01:09:52.850] Speaker 2: We have lost elections before.
[01:09:53.506 - 01:09:54.849] Speaker 2: 14 and 4.
[01:09:55.670 - 01:10:07.153] Speaker 2: Think about it, if I had won the 2004 election, I would always tell people that luck doesn't always write victory, it sometimes writes defeat.
[01:10:08.796 - 01:10:10.219] Speaker 1: And you are unbothered by it.
[01:10:10.239 - 01:10:11.922] Speaker 2: Yes, because I failed before.
[01:10:12.578 - 01:10:16.482] Speaker 2: I think one of the greatest misconceptions people have is achievement.
[01:10:16.683 - 01:10:19.506] Speaker 2: Achiever means from one achievement to another.
[01:10:19.566 - 01:10:19.766] Speaker 2: No.
[01:10:19.986 - 01:10:21.568] Speaker 2: From one failure to another.
[01:10:21.588 - 01:10:23.410] Speaker 2: In between some achievement.
[01:10:25.192 - 01:10:28.876] Speaker 2: So on 4th June, there is a temple of Mother in my house.
[01:10:29.677 - 01:10:32.981] Speaker 2: I was smiling and I was saying, whatever happened was good.
[01:10:33.001 - 01:10:35.163] Speaker 2: The person sitting next to me was like, Oh God!
[01:10:35.183 - 01:10:37.766] Speaker 2: Sister, I have become mental.
[01:10:37.786 - 01:10:38.807] Speaker 1: What goes on in your head?
[01:10:39.368 - 01:10:39.788] Speaker 2: Nothing.
[01:10:40.489 - 01:10:41.330] Speaker 1: Before the result.
[01:10:41.698 - 01:10:42.739] Speaker 2: Planning the next thing.
[01:10:43.320 - 01:10:44.041] Speaker 1: Before the result.
[01:10:44.061 - 01:10:45.322] Speaker 2: I am done with the project.
[01:10:45.903 - 01:10:46.584] Speaker 2: Go to the next thing.
[01:10:46.664 - 01:10:48.967] Speaker 1: No, before the result what goes on in your head?
[01:10:49.427 - 01:10:50.068] Speaker 2: That only.
[01:10:50.088 - 01:10:52.271] Speaker 2: I did that in 19 or so when they were counting.
[01:10:52.751 - 01:10:53.712] Speaker 2: And they said I won.
[01:10:53.732 - 01:10:54.673] Speaker 2: I said okay, it's done.
[01:10:56.175 - 01:11:00.200] Speaker 2: So it's not as if I am unaffected because I have trained myself only at loss.
[01:11:00.721 - 01:11:02.222] Speaker 2: I am unaffected even when we win.
[01:11:02.683 - 01:11:04.705] Speaker 2: I love it.
[01:11:04.725 - 01:11:05.667] Speaker 2: Move ahead.
[01:11:06.107 - 01:11:08.530] Speaker 2: I never went and took my certificate of victory.
[01:11:08.674 - 01:11:16.763] Speaker 2: in 19, which was a historical political victory because the Indian National Congress sitting president has never lost in the history of this country.
[01:11:16.803 - 01:11:18.445] Speaker 2: That too from their bastion.
[01:11:18.585 - 01:11:20.167] Speaker 2: Amethi is an unwinnable seat.
[01:11:21.148 - 01:11:29.197] Speaker 2: And the first non-congress person and a first woman to ever complete five years there was not from the family, Gandhi family.
[01:11:30.138 - 01:11:33.822] Speaker 2: So I knew the history I had created, but I was like, yes, let's move forward.
[01:11:33.842 - 01:11:37.106] Speaker 2: So the team which was working in Amethi, you go and get the certificate.
[01:11:37.698 - 01:11:38.880] Speaker 2: What are you doing?
[01:11:38.900 - 01:11:39.582] Speaker 2: I'm going home and sleeping.
[01:11:43.169 - 01:11:49.522] Speaker 2: It's not as if I am, you know, it's a mind frame to battle out when I've lost something.
[01:11:49.562 - 01:11:51.025] Speaker 2: I'm like that in success also.
[01:11:51.446 - 01:11:52.087] Speaker 1: I love it.
[01:11:52.408 - 01:11:52.768] Speaker 2: I love it.
[01:11:52.808 - 01:11:55.634] Speaker 2: Beyond a point, even in kyunki,
[01:11:55.874 - 01:11:58.177] Speaker 2: I think they kept giving every year best actor.
[01:11:58.237 - 01:12:00.321] Speaker 2: Till I one day went on stage and I declared it only.
[01:12:00.681 - 01:12:01.542] Speaker 2: Don't give next year.
[01:12:02.504 - 01:12:05.248] Speaker 2: And people are so arrogant.
[01:12:05.268 - 01:12:06.770] Speaker 2: I said but genuinely don't give.
[01:12:07.131 - 01:12:08.593] Speaker 2: I mean we are the most popular.
[01:12:08.613 - 01:12:11.437] Speaker 2: So by that default only come to us.
[01:12:11.537 - 01:12:13.700] Speaker 2: I said there are others who are doing genuinely good work.
[01:12:14.522 - 01:12:14.922] Speaker 2: Give them.
[01:12:15.743 - 01:12:17.987] Speaker 2: And I still remember people like what did she say?
[01:12:20.050 - 01:12:21.612] Speaker 1: That's being so honest and nice.
[01:12:21.812 - 01:12:22.994] Speaker 2: But it's true.
[01:12:23.874 - 01:12:28.779] Speaker 2: In life, what our elders used to say, will you carry everything on your chest?
[01:12:29.160 - 01:12:32.504] Speaker 2: It is true, leave it for others.
[01:12:32.584 - 01:12:35.327] Speaker 2: Because a leader becomes himself.
[01:12:35.347 - 01:12:37.569] Speaker 2: The real legacy is when you make others a leader.
[01:12:37.589 - 01:12:41.073] Speaker 2: Help others to succeed.
[01:12:41.153 - 01:12:45.698] Speaker 2: It doesn't matter if they remember or not.
[01:12:45.718 - 01:12:47.320] Speaker 2: You know that, right?
[01:12:47.781 - 01:12:48.361] Speaker 2: That matters.
[01:12:49.062 - 01:12:49.402] Speaker 1: True.
[01:12:49.422 - 01:12:52.626] Speaker 1: I ask this to everybody who I enjoy conversation with.
[01:12:53.122 - 01:12:54.023] Speaker 1: Give me a feedback.
[01:12:54.223 - 01:12:55.364] Speaker 1: How can I be better?
[01:12:56.185 - 01:12:56.766] Speaker 1: How can I be better?
[01:13:00.289 - 01:13:00.970] Speaker 1: Don't.
[01:13:00.990 - 01:13:01.130] Unknown: Don't?
[01:13:01.890 - 01:13:02.011] Speaker 1: No.
[01:13:02.031 - 01:13:02.191] Speaker 1: Means?
[01:13:02.251 - 01:13:03.292] Speaker 1: You are just fine.
[01:13:03.312 - 01:13:07.115] Speaker 1: I want to be just better.
[01:13:07.135 - 01:13:09.638] Speaker 2: There is no need to change everything.
[01:13:12.020 - 01:13:13.001] Speaker 2: I am like this even before.
[01:13:13.021 - 01:13:22.290] Speaker 2: What happens is that people want to change success in the desire to do better.
[01:13:23.746 - 01:13:27.830] Speaker 2: But we forget that why success is there, because it is as it is.
[01:13:27.850 - 01:13:34.877] Speaker 2: You are not a machine, that you can increase your horsepower.
[01:13:34.897 - 01:13:35.738] Speaker 2: You are a human being.
[01:13:38.100 - 01:13:40.483] Speaker 2: So why are you reaching here?
[01:13:40.503 - 01:13:41.964] Speaker 2: The nature has brought you here.
[01:13:42.785 - 01:13:43.446] Speaker 2: So don't change it.
[01:13:45.568 - 01:13:47.570] Speaker 1: But you must have seen so many people.
[01:13:47.650 - 01:13:50.233] Speaker 2: Because even this much changes.
[01:13:50.253 - 01:13:51.634] Speaker 2: There are many repercussions.
[01:13:53.026 - 01:13:59.756] Speaker 2: If you want to improve yourself as a professional, read about every person, meet them.
[01:13:59.776 - 01:14:00.137] Speaker 2: Meet people.
[01:14:01.399 - 01:14:06.607] Speaker 2: What has happened here is that it has become less of meeting and getting together.
[01:14:06.627 - 01:14:10.072] Speaker 2: A photographer recently did a very good exhibition.
[01:14:10.092 - 01:14:15.100] Speaker 2: He took photographs of people and removed the phone from their hands.
[01:14:15.300 - 01:14:19.026] Speaker 2: So many people are meeting in empty hands, standing in a crowd.
[01:14:19.046 - 01:14:21.630] Speaker 2: No one is talking to each other in the crowd.
[01:14:21.650 - 01:14:21.970] Speaker 2: Meet people.
[01:14:22.466 - 01:14:28.955] Speaker 2: And don't meet them, the achievers, meet them too.
[01:14:29.015 - 01:14:31.879] Speaker 2: Those who have lost a lot.
[01:14:31.899 - 01:14:34.422] Speaker 2: And at that time you can sit with them and hold their shoulders.
[01:14:34.442 - 01:14:36.825] Speaker 2: There is no greater satisfaction than that.
[01:14:38.668 - 01:14:42.833] Speaker 2: Because they are the ones who feel that nobody will have the time of day for them.
[01:14:43.274 - 01:14:43.995] Speaker 1: Nice.
[01:14:44.015 - 01:14:44.596] Speaker 1: I'll keep that.
[01:14:45.517 - 01:14:46.719] Speaker 1: I'll keep that.
[01:14:46.739 - 01:14:52.146] Speaker 1: I'm still not happy with no feedback but I get your point.
[01:14:52.514 - 01:14:53.955] Speaker 1: I actually like it better.
[01:14:56.278 - 01:14:58.600] Speaker 2: Everybody you meet is trying to change something in you.
[01:15:00.382 - 01:15:06.048] Speaker 2: What we don't realize is as human beings, we are waiting for that one person who will accept us as we are.
[01:15:08.170 - 01:15:13.875] Speaker 2: You are meeting Shruti Rani who is happy to meet you just as you are.
[01:15:15.037 - 01:15:16.858] Speaker 2: There is nothing about you that needs to change.
[01:15:18.440 - 01:15:20.402] Speaker 2: And that sentiment
[01:15:21.186 - 01:15:24.471] Speaker 2: There are only two other people in this planet who will exhibit it towards you.
[01:15:25.052 - 01:15:25.592] Speaker 2: Your parents.
[01:15:28.937 - 01:15:29.178] Speaker 1: True.
[01:15:30.019 - 01:15:30.419] Speaker 1: Thank you.
[01:15:31.481 - 01:15:31.781] Unknown: You're welcome.
[01:15:31.801 - 01:15:32.943] Speaker 1: Thank you so much for this.
[01:15:33.424 - 01:15:34.165] Speaker 1: Loved having you.
[01:15:44.079 - 01:15:44.360] Speaker 2: Hello.
[01:15:44.600 - 01:15:46.703] Speaker 2: My God, you're such a lovely office.
[01:15:46.723 - 01:15:48.065] Speaker 2: Thank you.
[01:15:48.085 - 01:15:48.626] Speaker 2: You're such a lovely buddy.
[01:15:49.058 - 01:15:58.354] Speaker 1: Can I extend this for another 20 minutes?
[01:16:00.866 - 01:16:04.290] Speaker 1: Thank you so much for watching this episode till the end.
[01:16:04.310 - 01:16:05.471] Speaker 1: Now you have to do 3 things.
[01:16:05.491 - 01:16:07.634] Speaker 1: First of all, subscribe to this channel.
[01:16:07.774 - 01:16:15.043] Speaker 1: Because the more you subscribe, the better and valuable guests we will be able to bring for you.
[01:16:15.063 - 01:16:21.951] Speaker 1: Number 2, tell me in the comments what did you like and what did you dislike in this episode so that we can't repeat those mistakes.
[01:16:21.971 - 01:16:28.338] Speaker 1: And what kind of guests do you want to see on our podcast so that we can bring them and give you more value.
[01:16:28.386 - 01:16:35.073] Speaker 1: And number three, share this episode with someone because one conversation can change someone's life.
