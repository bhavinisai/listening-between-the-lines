[music] [music] [music] Hi, how are you?
[music] >> When you speak Tamil, I can understand it cuz I'm also a South Indian.
Have you been to Bangalore much?
>> How is the Canada industry?
>> Canada industry is now rocking, right?
>> Our house where all the studios used to exist.
I wish I could sing better and then I would have but I can't.
It feels like you're a or from what I've heard you were very introverted.
>> What changed?
>> At what age did dad pass away?
She decided for me that I should be in music.
But >> what year did you stop going to school?
>> That's why I never speak up with my dad.
I think uh after that to forget what the trauma took ages, right?
>> And has that memory changed?
So even now even today that probably set the standard for me to where I should head as a human being as a successor to him.
>> And how did that change you?
How does it affect you first and how does it change you later?
>> Um that's the only holding ground for you the memories and what your dad is what he represented or how he worked.
And um so to everyone your dad is your first hero >> right?
So >> did the position of your mother in your head change after your father's demise?
>> And do they tell you what to play or do you have to come up with?
But after a while, I think when I bought my computer systems, my >> which is around 86, >> I they gave me the freedom.
If you could pick one instrument and never play another again, which one would it be?
It's hard to travel with, right?
>> No, but keyboard is like you can you can have a smaller one, >> right?
>> The electronic one, >> right?
>> But having a piano I could only afford after probably six, seven years of my earning.
>> 10 years and then they started first telling you what you should play and then allowing you your own compositions or arrangement.
My >> jingles you mean ads right?
>> What is a scratch?
>> When did it all change?
When did it when was that ah >> 91?
Yeah, >> I know actually magic happened when I built my studio 89 Pitan studio which I have >> is when I felt like empowered like I had something which nobody had >> which was >> which my home studio >> why did that change so much?
Many people probably had access to a studio, right?
>> No, those days studios means like the big halls where uh 90 people can play together.
>> So when I build my home studio is when I realize like nobody will judge me whether I do good music or bad music.
Oh, what is it?
What is the new stuff?
M >> how many people are going to lose jobs?
>> So I was the gizmo guy, right?
>> So if I want to become a musician in my life or if people watching want to become a musician, what is that thing they have to do now?
Is there some equivalent for today?
>> What if I'm already learned?
But somebody who is a learned trained musician.
And there you will teach me how to compose music.
What year was this?
Every actor, every composer wanted to work with him, >> right?
>> Uh he said no no no you should work with everyone.
He said no you should work with everyone.
>> Why do you think that was?
>> I don't know why I had this thing of leaving everything.
>> Is that because fear of disappointment is?
I felt I would do two.
You buy a new rhythm machine, you have to learn how >> where the where to project load.
Most of them are common, >> right?
[laughter] >> Does he?
M >> it's not a unlike some other places where they don't hug you and see what you're wearing >> the [laughter] back.
So I I would think why is it appealing to Bangalore and Chennai to live under their means and why is the opposite the whole showing living in the moment more appealing to the >> nothing wrong in I think it's the way I think is consistency over years rather than you know you can buy the best car you can buy a Bugatti you can be in the best flat But then ultimately where do you get the happiness in the studio?
So if you look at my studio I have a the most expensive piano, the most expensive mixer >> but that's again helping me to serve better >> right?
So it's a little old school but I believe that >> when I thought about this I I was thinking about things like okay maybe north India saw so much war so many people invaded people did not live for as long so they lived more in the moment people in the south have largely been >> secure for a long period of time >> nobody's secure >> relatively >> they have other tortures in life >> yeah uh it is a double-edged sword when when we go out it's important to present India in the best possible way >> because the whole world think India's in poverty and this and that >> I feel like India the certain people are not in poverty >> we probably have the richest Indians here >> and it's important to represent the country with dignity >> to dress up to show that we are culture people we have a great history and culture in style and thing it's very very important you don't want to show them that very simple when when people are judging you >> you know as an Indian I feel like I want to be in the best representative the best car outside where I I when I go and I'm in LA I have Bentley >> I lease a Bentley so >> I mean at least I had that time at least right [laughter] >> so >> why a Bentley van >> because it's easy it's cheaper you have to pay 110% duty here there you just lease and >> right but is You can get any car like >> you can get >> as an artist the style aesthetic of Bentley appeals most >> not like that I because I never believed in that and because it was so cheap there >> right >> to to rent any car I said I had that moment of 2 years >> driving my kids around >> hey come let's go and I have still have videos of my son screaming when I'm going fast sitting at the back >> and you started driving when you were really early and still enjoy driving do you still drive >> I do drive started driving again >> I got my Mahendra every car Uh >> and uh there I have uh >> why Mahindra electric cara?
>> And beyond Roa and the initial success, what happened after that also?
Were you in some way on the cusp of a change in trend of what kind of music was working in India in the '90s?
Did you catch a change in trend or did you create a change in trend?
What was >> there was a denial that oh this one last and I think there's a denial constantly for >> what was the incumbent trend and what was the change in trend?
>> So you changed that trend into Roa kind of music and how would you articulate that?
What was Roa kind of music?
Roa was very so my intention was when I met Manatam G I said when we are listening to Pink Floyd >> Queen >> right >> um John Williams evangelist Beatles Michael Jackson >> they don't listen to us right >> so what's the reason >> language production and uh vibe feel recording multiple things, right?
I said Tamar song which we do here should go and my if you look at my internet um initial interviews, it says uh each Tamil [clears throat] song I do should go around the world, >> right?
>> I wanted to take it inch by inch to what I felt would be the future of my sound for the world.
The soul actually wishes something, it manifests, right?
When it's sincere, they they grab it because we look at all the the voice talent shows, they pick the best compositions usually.
It needs to be more immersive >> and that's what we're doing.
It should not be the oh I'm giving you classical music listen to it it's good for you.
>> The narrative is it's how you make them feel.
It feels like somebody's >> It feels lived in, right?
>> No, >> I think art should be taught artistic view should be taught to the kids from kindergarten.
when I went to Italy that's what I found or you go to Jaipur or Kerala they have a sense of uh style which and neatness and I'm not saying I'm I've not been to many states but I feel like uh that's very important to inject that in the minds of younger people who will change the look of a country >> western cities are very homogeneous like every building will have the same color >> that is US [laughter] >> but if you go to places like uh even Italy uh Greece is different, >> Spain is different, >> Morocco is different.
>> Don't you feel like Indian cities have every building which is so different and the color is so different that it doesn't look cohesive?
So they look at a country in a way where they will be the future people who will change the way it looks better like AI.
Because I think you're empowering people with with a vision >> who don't know the chops.
It's like how how a narrator.
So like when when I'm talking to you, if I talk anything boring, you won't look at me.
>> Right?
M >> it's like a conversation where um one is like this tune is going like this and I need to surprise them with this one.
So it is an experience right >> that's how I used to think I'm still thinking the same way.
Do you think to be as successful as you have been you need to catch a counter trend?
>> What is a counter trend?
What do you think the next change in trend will be that they can get on early?
I think all of them are so smart now >> and because the exposure >> they get to see everything on reals and and social media >> every person is a makeup person an actor a cinematographer a director and it's fascinating to see how the younger people are evolving like I discover so many people who are extraordinary in comedy >> in direction >> in effective you know reels like it's just 30 seconds and >> they have to come up with stuff, >> right?
You should go back to music and lean into it.
>> I'll show you how bad I am at some point in >> No, bad and good is subjective.
It's subjective, >> right?
M >> like you know good music when you listen to it.
>> That's how it is.
>> So but you have to keep digging >> right?
>> And the more you dig you will you will forget yourself that you'll become that >> right?
How do I Okay, this is very personal.
>> Then I realized that when I'm composing, I don't have to be in tune.
I just need to understand what tune.
Then when I'm on the stage is when I realized like I have to be in tune because people are recording, people are putting it on YouTube.
>> Then I started uh my teacher said um who passed away.
>> Do you think the same is true for music?
In when I was young, I felt I was very bad at music.
>> I had stalwarts like Marilyn Swinwas who was a genius.
You could play he was younger than me.
>> And I met a teacher called uh Jacob John who's my father's friend.
He would wantedly play with mistakes >> and we let you play.
[laughter] >> Any secrets?
>> Secrets?
>> And then I have I have like notes about different years of your life and what happened and I'm trying to like go into today.
What's happening around this era?
>> When you started a studio, you got this big break in Roa.
Tell us where your mind is at 2006 7 8 around this era global slowdown era.
And then that's when my foundation idea of foundation came by.
>> So the idea of uh starting the school came at 2008 where >> uh I called one of my associates and said hey we have to start a school.
My mother was there >> and we started the CM conservatory where it is now in Chennai.
>> Um and then it started evolving and then Oscars happened all the stuff in 2008 2009 >> I was in a band with MC Jagger and >> how big is that?
Like I've always heard of Oscars as being like this crazy ass thing that >> what is it actually like?
>> I think when you see from outside it's much more fascinating >> than being inside.
First when I got the critics award nobody called me.
>> So that I could see the whole evolution of how famous that movie and about the music and you're all becoming.
>> No when you're at home yes but if you step out >> I step out very rarely >> but whenever you do >> I'm prepared for it.
>> Can you take a photograph?
>> Is there an onoff button?
>> For what?
>> For when some fan walks up to you and he's and you're tired, you're in transit.
>> Uh no security anywhere in >> only only when I'm doing shows, >> right?
>> Cuz when you don't go with security, people don't take you seriously.
Only when like group of six people come over, somebody's important.
Oh, that should be him.
>> So >> when you go to dinner in Chennai, for example, [snorts] you have to >> That is the irony of my life.
When nobody allows you to eat any even in a marriage when you go there when you're eating people say can I take a photograph I said I'm eating no but we are going to go we have to go so they don't understand that person is eating he's a human being >> he's not being bought by you but then you understand that how important you are in their life and they don't want to miss the chance to take their perspective so I'd never eat in marriages I just go wish them I said they won't allow Whenever I've worked with like rock stars abroad, >> they're just straight on the face and I don't do that.
>> That's why people don't come because most of them are like that.
[laughter] >> Why is that?
>> Which one?
One was a electronic Greek geek >> who used to love making amplifiers.
>> I was fascinated with electronics when I was young.
Is it the same even now?
Is it tough to be friends for somebody in your position?
I have to make sure that I now pull them on to a dinner or something where not everybody's free.
They all have their own lives now, right?
>> Do you have friends?
I treat like when I work with Anandra or Mia or >> uh >> people ask me this question and I say who are your friends?
>> Then then I should have a life where I go to a club or >> no I go to a gym or something.
>> I love what I'm doing.
Now it's metahumans and this AI >> and this virtual reality and you know I have younger people who are joining and doing amazing work.
Say, "Hey, I would like to meet you >> then."
Hey sir, how are you?
>> Really?
>> Yeah, I was doing co >> DM on what platform?
>> You're active like that?
You use it yourself?
>> Can I message you?
Who's >> What would be interesting for me to send you on Instagram?
>> I have this investor who's got $1 billion to invest in your [laughter] company.
>> And then >> you went you went to the US and met a bunch of AI people, right?
You went to perplexity, you went to >> Who was the most interesting of them all?
>> What did you make of him?
What did you make of him?
>> What do you make of Sam?
That's what I'm saying.
If there is a young kid in Bangalore trying to build a AI rapper albeit >> by virtue of regulation he will be regulated out of >> no not that kind of regulation not in entertainment I'm saying in in finding a way all the [clears throat] people running things the entrepreneurs or the chief >> they should be careful in finding because this is history is going to talk about them in future >> like how they made something which is a monster as a blessing, right?
It could become a monster.
I've been like working, interning with these AI companies trying to learn what what is coming up next, what can be done.
The reason shaker mountain is also set a pattern >> where we use the best of AI >> and we use the best of humans >> and there'll be so many jobs there's so much of uh human contribution to something like big as this so that >> it becomes an industry by itself >> right AI in music will hurt musicians right >> it'll hurt but then can AI go and sing with the guitar in a house or in a concert >> or can it teach in the human way which a teacher has been teaching with the spirit passing on the spirit of music to a >> student there are so many things which comes human experience is the the best word I would say which it can't do anything on TV could be generated now >> right so I I think that that's why live concerts live dance live musical theater symphonies will be respected even more, right?
[laughter] I go like a blank slate because >> like if a movie producer tells you for example say in Hollywood that this is not working, can we change it?
What do you do?
I uh I don't go with one idea, >> right?
>> I put that in somewhere I think they will connect to something but this is nice but can you do this?
It's >> that is why that will never work.
So what he did next is he just he was on a scaffolding.
For the first time it's starting to feel like it could be the form factor.
Do you have a bet on what could be the form factor of tomorrow?
How you interact with AI?
>> No, but this the like when you come to Chennai play you my experience it's installed there.
>> You will understand what I'm talking about.
I want to speak about what you want to speak about.
>> Again, >> uh this idea came from when I was hanging out in LA.
I said like why are Indians not creating something for the west or not the west for the whole world right because we've seen great bands coming from um Sweden, America, England, Africa but the only Indian was famous like Ravish Shankar Zakar Rosin Alshanka Subramanyam >> but then uh why can't young India create something like that?
We can't go back to what they did but we need to find the space which India what India wants to say to the world.
>> So that's where secret mountain was created >> and not just to sing Hindi songs.
>> Can you simplify it for me?
>> I saw the characters who are the band members, the blonde guy, the the Punjabi guy, all of them.
>> But what does that mean really?
Uh it talks about [sighs] each community each where they're coming from like Africa, >> North India, South India, Ireland.
So we we go like this is what we want to say.
Is it okay politically?
The voices might change >> because they're all live voices, right?
>> The only the face of that, >> right?
They won't have flash and blood, but what what going what's going to appear on TV or or in a in a show will be real because because of the technology hologram and >> and why would this be better than say Red Shiran is writing a song for one of those characters, >> him singing it himself and having his face on it?
So I felt like >> taking the burden on myself to see how much I can go dwell in it making it pop.
Do you think an audience will I mean the same premise I guess in a way applies to movies where >> you look at uh did you see the ABA Voyager?
>> You saw that >> the hologram right?
Not they didn't mention the same song, >> right?
What will be happening with this?
They could also perform in three different places too >> at the same time.
Omni potent >> because they're virtual, right?
They could be performing in England, in India, in Dubai all the same time, >> right?
>> Different different teams can come in, >> right?
>> And they could become a series, they could become a movie.
>> Have you seen NFTs?
It started like in a way when Hara came to >> it started like can we do a you know crypto NFT kind of thing.
When we started it was a a game engine, Unreal Engine and Metahumans.
If there was a movie with say uh Shah Ruk Khan in a particular actress, not really them but artificially generated movie would you watch it?
You don't do what what a Shah Rukhan will do >> well.
So I determine and I've set the rules, the parameters for what how much it can talk, how much money you can send to each fan.
>> Why would it send money to a fan?
>> I know people have attempted this with social media where super users >> Yeah.
>> That is the plan >> right?
>> If the output they are throwing out, are they liable?
But then that's why we have to set the parameters.
just keep quiet, >> right?
It's very important to entertain in a way where >> people get hope and faith.
>> And yeah, >> someone said a passion ceases to be a passion when you truly understand it.
Like the cook is the first taster, right?
>> No, because I I don't know what it is.
>> No, I'm very critical, >> right?
>> When I um listen to it a couple of days back later or a week later, you you know what's working, what's not working.
M >> what makes you Oh, I love that.
I think what happens when you do something constantly >> you get fatigued >> your mind becomes tired >> and in in this case where um photography or anything else poetry or it's all part of the creative industry it's not like gambling or going away from something losing money it is enhancing your widening your imagination widening your confidence in you that you can do much Oh, >> are you still able to do that?
>> Are you farming now?
>> That's where house samadi is also there.
Tell us what's going on in the personal side.
Where is your head space at?
How are you looking at society, at music, at what is occupying?
If any kid who's created by God, this the light of God is in every kid and the knowledge comes from God.
So that's what we discovered and it's a phenomenal breakthrough which we are proud as a family.
>> Do you think humans can innately be altruistic selfless?
It is how we brought up.
If you go one level deeper, >> yeah, >> why is being selfless appealing?
>> Only when you serve.
Did they do it with the intent of service or did they do it with the intent of individual gain that they were chasing?
But when you think about uh they're not they you you can see the sweat, you can see the >> and everybody wants their work to shine, >> right?
>> When they want the work to excel, that means it is a excel.
It's not mediocrity, right?
The sincerity is what makes them tick.
>> If I'm not sincere in my music, they're going to throw me out from a movie, right?
I should have done that better.
I should have done.
I was going through some I would not say bad time but I would say I was feeling vulnerable because of some issue being blamed for something that I didn't have anything to do with and I was sitting and thinking about all these things when I have been altruistic is it because the projection of altruism has appealed because in the society that so if if I go back in time when I think about Right?
>> If you believe in God, whichever god, there's only one creator, right?
I've taken that path where I feel like every breath is a blessing to me.
Right?
So each one gets what they share by becoming worthy of it.
That's what the wonderment tour is about which I'm doing.
>> Can you tell me more about Sufism?
>> How do you discover yourself?
We know some people achieve it early and when they achieve it early they go off they pass off.
>> So when that happens is your voice becomes the voice of God.
So that's why we're all spiritual we call us >> fakis spiritual beggars.
We might be rich in money but poor in spirituality and that's one of the reasons why um I consider myself as a spiritual >> beggar.
I said I know it's going to come back and 3 years later what a song this is.
>> So that self validation is very important to find believe in your work and find why it is not.
If all >> musical actually right music is giving and I'm getting so much love from people >> I'm so I feel worthless most of the times like do I need this?
Do I deserve this?
>> When I think of Indians, I think of you know politics.
There is one person who comes to mind.
When I think of music not I when the country thinks of music you come to mind.
>> So, who's the god?
But >> actually, you know, strangely what happened was >> Mani wanted a he wanted a love song.
>> I was like, what love song?
So I just recorded it and so next day like where is the tune?
He doesn't stand on one note because that's that's his style, right?
>> Um I think we need to do a bim, you know, when she's running.
>> How does that make you feel?
>> It's a double-edged sword, right?
M >> I said I'm sincere to what I believe in and even if I shout at people I say sorry guys I'm human right sometimes the pressure I shout at people >> you don't look like somebody who can shout at people >> come to my studio >> not always >> yeah you seem like you have a very calm >> I'm calm most of the time but >> for me my work sincerity is it demands a lot of if something is not happening then I'm failing myself and failing the client the client When was the last time you shouted at somebody and for what?
[laughter] >> Really?
>> No, just because it's a very demanding work, >> right?
>> Suppose if you're having 77 tracks and then you want the strings to be loud or even, you know, EQing a strings or >> uh I need speed like musicians are passionate, right?
>> You don't want somebody to take like 30 minutes to get something which I think could just take >> 1 minute.
>> Is that what irritates you?
something taking longer than it should.
>> Anyway, >> what are you looking forward to at this point?
What what are you scared of and what are you looking forward?
>> Scared of?
>> And does it affect you in that order?
>> And when you say God, you in a way are saying universe >> the the creator >> the creator.
>> Is that where your music is most inspired by nature?
>> Also mathematical >> of uh and the complexity of every creature, every creation >> and in the galaxy we're just not even a dot, right?
And the multiple galaxies and >> makes you humble >> how small you are, how the micro and macro they say, right?
>> Are you bored of movies now?
>> My part is just music, right?
Do you think there's a future to the movie business?
It's going to stay but it should be reinvented.
>> Can you tell me how?
I think immersive thing is the future like the spear what what's doing Vegas.
I know what's going to happen.
So let me look at who's you know Instagram me or what's happening.
>> But can a theater screen afford that?
when people make money they they would have to invest more money >> but this >> even each metro can have one >> right >> right >> and uh we don't even have a proper symphony hall in any of India nowhere and musical theater is another important aspect of entertainment which could come in because we have so many talented singers actors here and they're all looking at movies and if you look at uh London West End or Broadway or Canada or Australia they have musical theater and it travels once you make one big hit it travels all over the world forever for like years 40 years 50 years it's there look at sound of music or phantom of the opera and we have great stories to tell and I've seen when I was a kid I've seen parisham raaneshwar and that's it now I think the only one which I keep seeing is smugglas Nothing was significant in India.
>> Is it a chicken and egg problem?
>> Can you just think about an airport?
If you could advise our audience to start a business in live, it's growing the fastest in terms of rate of growth versus other form of entertainment, what could somebody start?
Huh?
>> But we should have scale.
We have like more population than China, right?
I see the same >> cannot export, >> right?
You think?
Like >> would that be something if somebody comes with a very interesting business pitch to build one of our young friends, would you be interested in [laughter] >> bring them in?
>> We'll create everything, >> right?
>> Anything else you want to say?
What are what is occupying your mind space that you're actually thinking about?
I think most people should stop.
Like now we wondering why is some crime happening in some corner of Africa.
Would you like to finish with a song?
Is it possible?
>> If I give you a guitar, would you like to?
If you tell me what chord to play.
>> I don't know what I'm just I'm in the talking mode now.
Huh?
Yeah, should be in tune.
What?
What chord is that?
>> Ready?
>> I'd love to come one day and sit in your studio when you're making a song.
When When are you making a song mixed?
Tonight?
>> Really?
>> You want to go make a song now?
>> What are you saying?
