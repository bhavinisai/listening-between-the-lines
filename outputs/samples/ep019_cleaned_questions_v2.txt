Has that happened with you?
>> I mean, where do you want to start?
The only person that can cancel [music] you is you?
>> Does a bad breakup hurt more or does hurt?
What [laughter] >> who do you think's winning the sale?
>> Do you have like footballer friends?
>> What advice do you give to someone like Speed?
Are the Sideman guys your best bros?

>> Oh, well, we could [music] just be bros outside of jail.
[laughter] >> WE COULD JUST do that.
There's lots of Indian fans who followed KSI's journey for a long time.
And the reason I'm doing this intro is for those few fans globally who are not familiar with KSI's work until this point.
like there's always things that get in the way of uh what matters to me.
And eventually, I just got to a point where I was getting ready to fight Dylan Dannis.
I was like, why am I doing this to myself?
Why am I putting myself through hell when there's something I I purely enjoy, something I enjoy so much more, and that's making content.
And it's been a process especially, you know, the first six, seven months to try and get it to a level I'm where I'm happy at.
>> Oh really?
>> Is that true though?
you know, from kidnapping to, you know, robbery to all the worst things you could think of.
They see that and they go, "Oh man, like do you really want to go back there?"
I haven't been Nigerian, which again, but like >> shame when you >> I know it's bad.
It's No, no, I know it's super bad, but I think for me it's like, >> you know, when I do go Nigeria, it's going to be special.
>> H I love how open your heart is, man.
I feel like you can tell when people are fake.
>> Are you happy with this success arc?
>> I remember when I was making YouTube content back in what, 2008, 2009, and I was like, "This is fun.
And I remember my parents being like, I don't know why you spend so much time doing this.
>> Um why did you not enjoy boxing as much?
>> I'd say the training, how physically and mentally draining it is, it's just like nothing else.
Bro, by the seventh, eighth week, you're like, why am I doing this?
I'm getting beat up, you know?
>> And then when you get there, it's like, "All right, cool.
Oh no, why why am I nervous?
What a waste of my time.
What a waste.
>> Did you ever think of a moment like that Anthony Joshua punch on Jake Paul's jaw?
Like do you ever think of injuries being a possibility during a match?
You think it's the idea of I'm in this ring with someone who's trying to knock me out.
If I lost that fight, well, I don't think AJ would have fought Jake Paul.
I don't think Jake Paul would be fighting.
It wouldn't none of this would have happened.
Like I before I didn't even know how to run.
I had to download an app called five uh couch to 5k to learn how to run.
Uh, did you ever speak to Logan and or Jake about what boxing gave you guys in the long term?
>> Do you have a bad side?
I felt like I had to when I was boxing.
And you know, I did some horrible things when I was doing the whole boxing thing.
But you had that's just how that's the fight game.
>> You feel like you've gained anything from the fighting phase other than like the material stuff?
When it comes to boxing, I'm done.
My main goal when I got into the boxing um ring again was to fight Jake Paul and Bill Misfits.
At that point, I was like, you know what?
And then he was just getting heavier and heavier and heavier trying to move the goalpost when it comes to weight.
Then it got to the point where I was like, "What am I doing, man?
>> How do you feel about money now at this stage of life?
I'm at a point where I've made it.
>> I think that's what you're chasing as well.
[laughter] >> What the best thing about me and then you could say the worst as well.
Because I always find it intriguing to see what >> I think the best thing about you is the comeback that you make every now and then.
Like when you know things are going down bad for you, >> you've have that mentality to just strike back.
I think I think >> What about worst?
Like you have to learn from what you want, you know, from the mistakes that you make.
>> You attract more of it, >> right?
>> Has that happened with you where you appreciate a cancellation from the past?
>> Well, I mean, where do you want to start?
[laughter] How many cancellations have I had?
>> I think that's what it takes to stay in content for really long.
>> Do you have like footballer friends?
>> I mean, >> have you got great advice from any footballer?
Like I wish I had that lock in when I was his age.
Does a bad breakup hurt more or does cancellation hurt?
I don't I think heartbreak is probably one of the worst things, >> right?
They always wonder like what if.
>> What?
>> But I definitely um I respect a lot of people who have public relationships.
>> Do you get to be anonymous anywhere?
>> Does it feel like a little bit like choking?
Do you feel >> No, I think the only place I can be anonymous is at home [laughter] in my house.
Uh we played Unraveled or Unra Oh, is it Unraveled?
Really?
Oh, >> you know the two people in prison, what's that one?
Like, we just we play all types of games when it comes to co-op.
>> What do you do when you're completely alone, man?
>> You feel like Dragon Ball Z kind of affected your adult mind?
>> WHAT?
[laughter] WHAT?
WAIT, WHERE YOU going with this?
I don't think I'm not like what what do you call people who like obsessed with pain?
Like I'm not I'm not there like oh where can I find that bit of pain?
>> So, have you heard of the Amani wedding?
It was this big wedding that you know about it?
And over this last one year, that's where my ball lands as well.
That's how like >> just be useful like depending on the person you're with or whatever it is.
>> How how far ahead do you visualize career or life or whatever?
>> How far ahead?
Well, I you know, I see me doing content probably for the rest of my life, you know, even when I'm like 70, 80, I think.
I mean, I don't know what the content's going to be.
>> How was life before content >> for me?
Like, like I've seen you doing podcasts with um Jimmy, a few others guys, and I'm just there like, you know, why am I not able to do this?
And like people who are great at just all types of stuff.
And now, you know, we live in a world where you can make a job with anything.
[laughter] >> I don't even know why I'm doing this to you.
>> You think we'll get cancelled after this episode?
I mean, I don't think there's anything that could be Honestly, these days it's hard to tell, man.
You know, I wouldn't mind going to jail with you, >> okay?
We play football and like [laughter] >> we could just be bros OUTSIDE THE JAIL.
YOU know that >> we could just do that.
>> When are you planning on going?
>> Who do you think's winning this year?
>> What?
The World Cup?
Like that's what I mean.
>> It's how it should be, man.
>> Anyone else mentioned this to you with this Indian football situation?
Really?
>> Cuz a lot of the guys who watch your stuff are also football fans.
>> Why?
>> I I don't know exactly where I was.
>> When was this?
He's >> Oh, really?
He's >> How did it feel meeting Andre for the first time, >> bro?
Because he was the reason why I became an Arsenal fan.
Like I think who you uh you've got Solier now.
>> Well, that's what I mean.
>> It'll be fun for like the other >> What?
Really?
I mean, but you know, when I was a kid, the first season I saw was the 2002 season, the Invincible season.
>> Chelsea, I don't know what's going on with them.
>> You think?
One of my wildest life moments being a content creator was podcasting with Rio Ferdinand who had like seen >> I saw that.
>> Who had seen like growing up.
>> In the world of content, are the Sideman guys your best bros?
>> Are you allowed to talk about that closed door meeting that happened where you guys have discussed the future of Sideman in detail?
Uh where have you heard that from?
We've had several meetings um just about what we want for the future and everything.
And you got to remember like life isn't how it was 10 years ago.
Like when we started, you know, we were just free and able to do whatever.
So sometimes a lot of time when we see each other is when we're filming.
[clears throat] >> So >> do you have like adult bro conversations with them?
Um, what advice do you give to someone like Speed?
>> Does he ever ask you for advice?
It's kind of one of those things where I don't know, you sometimes you don't you feel like you don't need advice.
And you know, people normally ask for advice when they're not up anymore, if that makes sense.
Like when they're down and they're going through it, that's norally when people ask for help and ask, you know, advice.
Like, yeah, you you you you can be the guy for a period of time and then eventually you're not the guy and then it's like how do you handle that?
How do you deal with that?
Or yeah, what do you do with that?
And it's [clears throat] kind of just like, yeah, I mean, I think that's where it's good to just Yeah.
Talk to people who are experienced and know the mistakes that have been made in the past that they can learn from.
You see a low, but it's about how you handle yourself in that phase.
Whether they're the cleaner, whether they're there as a runner or whether they're a CEO, whether they're the most famous person, who cares?
>> You can you can >> I'm here.
>> Love I think [laughter] I think my bro said India number one when he got here.
