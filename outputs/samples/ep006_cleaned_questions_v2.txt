>> It's hot though, right?
>> You live here?
[Music] >> Where are you based?
Where?
>> Have you been recently?
We got teams there and >> it's just a like a group who is super excited.
The energy you get out of the teams when you go visit them is it's pretty awesome.
>> What's happening in India D with I know your main competition is Ola who's also a really good friend of mine.
Well, have we officially started?
And >> what do you think Rapido is getting right that the others are not?
then the the driver pay is higher than a player than a player who like us who's taking a commission on every trip.
So the real test of the business isn't how fast you can grow if you're spending.
Um it's actually how fast you can grow while you're profitable.
>> Uh and during when I was born in Iran, the shaver was really trying to modernize Iran very quickly.
Can >> I digress and ask a question?
>> Whenever I read about Iran's history, >> when I talk to the young folk, the shast time seems to have been this great time.
What happened?
Why did it change?
Why did the regime change?
Well, I think it was a great time for uh people who were lucky enough to participate in the modernization of Iran.
The fact >> was it like crony capitalism?
Uh and I think he didn't bring along the outskirts, the people who lived in smaller cities, etc.
Now, do I think that the time under the sha was a better time?
Does it get in the way in any way today?
The fact that your origins are there while the countries where you live today and that might be in conflict.
But would I love to go back?
I would.
It's a group of people who want to build.
It's a group of people who value education, who are ambitious.
Um so I don't find it a conflict with who I am now.
>> I have Iranian friends who live in India now.
But >> um again, I think what's happened in Iran is uh it's really unfair to the people there.
Are you religious, Dar?
I'd say I'm spiritual, right?
>> At the very core, do you think that is what religion is?
>> and you rebuilt religions on Earth, there's a high probability that the nature of those religions and the stories would be different.
>> What is spirituality to you?
A lot of people ask me if I'm spiritual and >> I'm like what is it?
I'm trying to figure out what the word even means to begin with.
And listen, there's there are some people who attribute that to perfectly logical causes, right?
Do you have family?
Do you have brothers and sisters?
>> You know, there are certain people who would say that your um what do you have?
So what you view as familial love is actually adaptation that is feeding you that familial love.
Why?
>> Um I came here when I was 9 years old.
We're now back at history, right?
So they were telling me you should ask D. And I said I'm meeting you the next day.
And they were telling me you should ask DH when he used to be here.
I don't know what that means or I don't know what I meant at the time.
But I do think that, you know, again, you could the that that connection I have with Iran, I believe is a spiritual connection.
I don't know where it comes from >> because I'm so American, right?
Again you could put a genetic underlying cause to it but I like the story of that being spirituality more.
>> Uh, we happened to have an uncle who's still alive now.
Uncle Nasola who uh lived in the US.
And then we knew we could never go back.
Whenever I go to I realize this when I go to Beverly Hills and everybody's Iranian.
Why is that?
>> Well, I think the Iranians who were wealthy got to go got to leave.
>> You know, for us, like America was this magic uh country where I went from like three channels in Iran to 35 channels cable.
Um and my mom who lived a life of absolute luxury had to go back to work.
>> Why was that?
Why was Barry Was Barry interesting or Expedia interesting?
he was um every time he came into a room, the whole room would light up.
And I'll tell you a little story of of when we met.
>> Uh, and I was the little crappy analyst who was running his his deal model.
He's like, "I want to meet the person who built this deal model."
And he forced me to like take him through every single line of this model so he could understand what he was doing.
You have a chief of staff who controls your >> uh your schedule the the and so all the information flow to you becomes controlled.
And I just fell in love with >> to everyone now like what happens to CEOs because of the management teams and so on and so forth.
>> Is it making us all stupid?
Um I don't know if Ticket Master operates in India but like you know they they would sell but I remember it.
>> And so at that point, Dyer and I were like, "Okay, what else looks like tickets?
What else looks or rhymes with transactions happening either over the phone or, you know, across a desk?
In the olden days, you would call and be like, "Hi, I'm Da and I'm >> I'm 5'9.
you know, like you leave your profile online and someone else would pick that profile.
I said hey maybe I can run this thing and that's when I took over what became uh Expedia and I ran Expedia for 13 years.
How does travel change next?
D I think it's a industry which has stagnated a bit in terms of >> how one books.
I I think you're exactly right and it frustrates me, >> you know, which is like what it the booking experience looks quite similar.
come into the room, you know, you're why can't it be you're in room uh, you know, 30 31E and just go up there?
I think the in market experience is something that hasn't been innovated on at all and it's something that could improve as well.
But is there one place where I don't have to think and agent can do everything?
>> So I don't think you're going to get to a place and I'm certainly not going to get to a place where I tell an agent to find me a hotel in San Francisco and just book it and then you know on the day when I arrive there I'm like where am I going?
But that coalation that kind of bringing everything together that's a that could be of very very high utility.
>> sitting on the board of Expedia and running Uber at the same time, where do you build what?
I think that's something that I would focus on, you know, with my Expedia and Uber hat on at the same time.
I hope it'll be Expedia who puts it all together.
>> But there could be kind of an umbrella agent who is truly representing your interest versus Expedia's interest.
>> When you have an umbrella agent, soon you'll have another and then another.
So will it come down to who is able to extrapolate your taste and can someone's taste be deciphered from past data.
>> Ultimately, so much will come down to taste, right?
In this world, >> uh, well, listen, taste, convenience, price, >> right?
I mean, you and I may be lucky enough where taste is >> the overriding factor, but there may be context for you, right?
If you're um coming to San Francisco and it's midweek, you may want a cheap, decent place close to the Uber offices, >> right?
We give you a little bit of time and convenience back in terms of where you want to go.
Um what you want to eat more and more what you want, right?
So, >> did you try Eats?
>> Does Uber Eatats have travel adapters?
>> And can I have an international?
>> Um but Eats now has groceries, it's got retail and I'll bet you you could have found that travel adapter.
>> Why is that?
Why did you get out?
What did you understand or learn about the Indian market?
>> Would you buy Zamato today?
>> How how big are network effects?
I'm guessing it's very hard to service a customer who wants to hire a Uber at 3:00 a.m. and 3 3:00 a.m. and 6 p.m. >> Yeah.
It's essentially what Travis did when with Uber when he founded it.
>> That is something that could work.
>> Have you had to project a more relatable image cuz you have to overcompensate for what Travis was projecting?
I one one thing that I really believe in is um I don't think it works if you're trying to be someone other than who you are.
What does it mean?
It's just like be true to who you are.
>> Uh but when I go to my family, >> I'm just one of the younger cousins and I'm no big deal.
>> It's such a relief to be that person who I just that's my comfort zone.
You know, I I when I played sports, I I would play defense.
I always celebrate with my team, >> right?
>> So that is who I am.
And maybe that's one of the reasons why I I wound up here uh here.
What do you think we should do?
What are the levels?
where should we I didn't want to do a peanut butter kind of a layoff etc.
I'm like, here's what we're going to do.
I would never ever want to go through that again but made us a better company.
But then what I've learned is there are certain circumstances where you have to switch your modes.
Here's what we're going to do.
So it it's who I am.
But a lot of people I know I think it's weirdly correlated to affluence want to pick the smaller guy the smaller brand uh individuals over corporations >> in such a world I get that relatable makes a lot more sense than all inspiring dogmatic >> but how does a company like Uber which is uh 40 plus billion in revenue and millions of rides and employees and all of How do you evolve to project the David image while you already have all of this?
>> I I do think that there is first of all I feel like David when you know we're competing in a technology world of trillion dollar plus companies, right?
>> Do you do that consciously project vulnerability?
>> Um Goliath doesn't >> I think I think it's kind of who I am.
>> And he would the minute I kind of thought I was hot I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.
You know, he he put me, you know, he he would just throw me on my in my place.
So, >> I think part of it is who I am.
I think part of it is is where Uber came from.
>> But how do you continue to look like the upstart tomorrow if the world picks you?
Now, now I would tell you that internally I do we are upstarts and I want to have that upstart mentality here.
Um, and it means that just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.
>> What have you learned?
Does it work?
And then what was the frontier becomes a part of the core and then you move to the next frontier.
You know that that's the biggest hack possible, right?
>> When you speak about Door Dash or when you when you spoke about uh Zomato right now you complimented them, praised them.
Uh, I heard you on a interview speaking about how Door Dash went after the suburbs and you guys missed out.
>> You praising competition, is that a way to appear more David in a David versus Goliath world?
Again, >> it it's not it's not a it's not an act, >> right?
You're curious about what others are doing.
Does India >> for long though in the US?
>> Does India as a market matter?
Dar you once observed when you were there that Indians are very demanding and they don't want to pay for anything.
It um it it matters hugely for us, right?
I'm going to go back to being a 20-year-old who's starting a business in this industry.
So how do I justify to myself that my business idea is sound that I'm going to charge 50 rupees a delivery?
How many people do I model for?
Where does that fit come across geographies?
So what I tell you is figure out if there's product market fit in that narrow segment.
But if my market size is only 20 million people who can afford it, still build it.
>> But then I'm competing with people like you who already are sitting on the network network effects in >> Yeah.
You you actually specifically should go after the small TAMs and then work your way into the adjacencies over a period of time.
And you look at where delivery has gone and how large it's become, you know, I don't think they would have ever predicted that.
But that's not what should be processing through your mind.
It should be can I build a service that has eventually strong unit economics that then I can build on top of.
>> Why is that?
There's there's a trade-off there, right?
Which is we can't tell our drivers when and when to work, right?
So you could call it a labor arbitrage.
I I call it a trade-off which is the driver and the courier can decide when and where they want to work.
And sometimes we will use incentives and or algorithms for example surge or circumstances when uh when demand exceeds supply.
And in those cases, we have to actually raise prices for that demand in order to attract enough drivers to get out into the market to pick out to pick up everyone, you know, arriving at 7:00 p.m. on a Thursday night at the airport or, you know, when when uh the Warriors uh game is is done, >> right?
Um, and I think overall when you look at society, it's it's good for society, right?
>> You've spoken about autonomous vehicles a bunch of times and >> uh I don't know if it'll happen sooner or later than you predict, >> but >> everyone's been wrong so far, so who knows?
>> What do you think wins?
So, why not take that shot?
And again now at some point will it be possible?
Why not >> include LAR as well in order to achieve superhuman safety.
I don't know when, >> but is the possible the better product?
I would I all of our partners um that we're working with now are using a combination of uh camera, radar, and LAR.
And you know, I personally think that's that's the right solution, but I could be proven wrong.
>> What happens to Uber's earners when if autonomous becomes safer and cheaper?
One could argue that putting a human behind a wheel is a disservice because you're putting somebody at risk.
At that point, what happens to all the earners who are working with Uber?
It's it's then why should humans drive, right?
Society would be uh I think there are about a million auto related fatalities in the world.
So, why not save those lives?
>> Um I I think that that is it's an inevitability for that to happen.
And and I think that would be a good outcome for society.
Uh, and what we're trying to do is make sure we communicate with our drivers appropriately.
But what happens to society?
What has happened to society repeatedly and repeatedly is that the workforce has adjusted over and over again, right?
It's a problem for Well, it is a it is a potential issue for Uber and it could be a real problem.
You know, how can we educate our workforce and bring to them opportunities that ultimately allow them to live the kinds of life that they that they want to?
Do you suspect Dara that you might lose access to data like you have now?
>> I watched a interview of his where he was speaking about how this could change how we eat.
>> Any view on that?
Do you think that's going to happen?
um they're a big partner and you know Travis is a uh is an entrepreneur that you should not underestimate.
>> Any view on what could happen to restaurants?
add to that you have the data and you start Dark Kitchens or what Travis is doing.
What happens to an old school restaurant business?
How do you do that?
Well, I I think if if you break down what restaurants do is there's a component which is food, >> right?
>> And there's another component which is hospitality, >> right?
>> Um, that is essentially where that system is going to go.
And yes, will it take share from the classic uh from the classic restaurant business?
If you look at restaurant sales, restaurant sales are growing faster than grocery sales, right?
Uh, and you as a restaurant have to understand where you want to be cuz I think the middle is going to be a difficult place to to live.
>> And I have found this even with myself that when I'm searching for something today, I don't use Google anymore.
>> Uh if I want to build a brand tomorrow and I want to market and nobody's landing on Google ads, uh what happens to the world of ads?
How does a brand get built?
How do I get the word out that I've started this new t-shirt company?
Well, I think that those surfaces for a brand to truly get built are there in terms of Instagram and Tik Tok and and Facebook, right?
She could not have done that 10 years ago.
Now, you know, would Liliana have the the you know, would she do well on Google?
>> Do you think labor cost for your earners will go up significantly?
So I think in an indirect way it could have an effect on us but I don't think it'll have a direct effect on us.
So D I have a fund back home in India and I spent >> You have a fund?
>> And I >> How's it doing?
>> All over the world or in India specifically?
>> Have you seen Chinese electric vehicles by the way?
>> Why though?
Why why are they so far ahead of everyone else now?
So you have the kind of the best of both worlds, which is you have industrial policy, but then the winners aren't whose buddies with the president, >> right?
>> The winners are who wins in a brutal competitive environment.
>> In a free market, can anyone compete in catchup?
>> In a free market, can anyone catch up to to China?
How do I compete?
>> Why is that?
>> So, if I make the bet today by investing capital in the assumption that all vehicles will be EV, do you think it's still a fair bet?
>> Yes, it's a better technology, but it's a question of you might want to pick where you're investing.
Where should I?
That that's a signal that I would look for, >> right?
>> Really?
I don't know if I should call you D because that's how we call it in India or D as well.
With every >> is he is he bigger than I am?
>> With everything you're building, Dra, uh is there a super app coming?
Is that the eventual outcome?
>> So I don't know if we will get to what you would call a super app but we certainly want to be a connected family of apps.
Super apps tend to work in societies without as much rebellion in more >> as much what >> rebellion.
>> If you were me, a 20-year-old boy or girl in India and you had to start a fresh, what would you build today and who would you build it with?
Who would your co-founder be?
Um, so I always think people people should know their own limits.
>> Uh, and I have enormous respect for those rebels >> who think that they can do it on their own.
My advice would be I I've always said when when I give career advice to people is I look for three things.
Um, one is I want to work for people who I like and I can learn from.
>> Second is I want to go to a place where I as an individual can make a difference.
Uh, and actually that's why like investment banking for me, like great people.
I think a lot of young people, they kind of think too much about like how much money they're going to make or this or that.
[Music] How did you hurt your hand?
