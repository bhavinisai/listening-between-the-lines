I said when do I get to live for myself?
What is it like to be back as Everywhere I would go, they would say you're a crappy actor.
>> Tulsi today could say something to Tulsi 25 years ago.
>> Have you ever felt that you had to to choose between being liked or respected?
>> Very angry editor shouting on my phone, Arus Swami, what is wrong with you?
And yet at the same time, when we look at true representation, the numbers remain very limited.
And when you look at the state assemblies, it's even less, under 10%.
And normally as you know on the show we have the format of a phenomenal woman and an expert who gives us valuable insights.
So what's it like in your part-time job?
>> It's it's fascinating how life comes full circle because 25 years ago I was called a part-time politician and a full-time actor.
>> And I think that when my political and media journey began, I began my media journey in the year 199596.
Now at that time I was what barely out of high school and um it was not a very very nice place for women to be in.
>> My father specifically asked me are you a dud head and I said why?
Um there were people around me who thought it was quite foolish because it is not easy to begin from scratch.
He says, "What am I to make of them?"
Because suddenly you're this rebel who wants to, you know, uh, lead a professional life.
Because before that, I was this introvert who would just read books all day and never speak to anybody.
I was not the regular girl who would hang out with other girls or have go to birthday parties or even paint my nails for that matter.
>> The first time I put my lipstick on was when I was a MissIndia finalist.
>> So my father said, "Why on earth would suddenly this change happen in this girl?"
He said he was very very clear that this is not a girl who you marry off to somebody.
I had a fire in my belly when I saw journalists on television.
HR said what's wrong with you?
>> And was there somebody that you took as an influence?
So I my first job was on the streets of Delhi in a place called Janpat where I was selling cosmetics for 200 bucks a day.
How hungry am I uh for either a job or what is my ambition?
So there was this whole patch of him dying and me left widdling my thumbs wondering who >> how old were you when he passed away?
So I went I spoke to my father who's running a career company and I said can I work with you?
>> I think I would have loved to be a fly on the wall in your home.
They said why is times of India calling?
I like it's for me and they're like why would they call you and they just wouldn't give me the phone because you know there's a hierarchy in such families which are conservative that why should the girl take the phone and who are you >> and there was a lady on the other end she said can I please speak to this girl Satimalotra and they said but why they know she's been selected they said but for war god >> uh we calling from feminis India and there was a bombshell and my father just lost it he was like What?
Why are you doing in a beauty pageant?
He was the person he said come here kid and can you just stand and like yeah and then he started talking to me about current affairs.
>> But I think what it gave me was an exposure that I never had before.
>> To be alone uh in a competitive uh world where beauty mattered.
>> So >> you wanted to do something that had more >> I wanted to do something which had which fueled me >> and you need a certain discipline to look good you know to present yourself I had none of it and I think that mercifully then I I had taken a loan from my dad because he's like I mean who's going to pay for this?
I have It's I would ask you so many questions about whether you think this was like the right motivation for you.
I like who falls in love in the emergency people are getting, you know, hassled.
I think you also understand it when you age yourself.
So I said, "Acha, so what do you do when you act?"
And everywhere I would go, they would say, "You're a crappy actor."
So, I went there and I asked him, I said, "Do you have a job left?
I said, "What is that?"
They said, "Well, the person you know who kind of mops the floor a little."
I said, "Ch, what do you do in this rung?"
I said, "How much is the money?"
That was like what?
I still remember when I first came to Mumbai, my mom was with me and you know there's a Kamlaneru park in town.
>> And I went there's a shoe shaped thing and the park and I thought that this is I mean now if you look at it retrospectively it's like this whole Kate Wit moment in Thailand looking at the whole queen's necklace and I said one day this city will know me and my mother would whacked me saying you know you need to come back to reality why do you think this will happen?
And is the character does it does it have any kind of I don't know if you're allowed to say does it encapsulate some of your evolution as a woman?
>> And when I came in as an actor, the male actor was getting paid more than me.
>> Do you get involved with like if you feel like this character is seen talk >> into the dialogues and writing?
>> Um, and actors deliver best when there is a sense of contributing to whatever comes to you as a scene or as a story.
>> If you have somebody who is uh very closed, then you don't give a brilliant product.
>> Any product or any project where people can work together including technicians.
There are times when I would ask uh an assistant or a technician to say do you think this sounds right?
There are times when you're using colloquial language.
I would actually go hunt for those people in my in my technical team to say I one of you are you from that background?
>> So now how will you manage your time between your part-time and your full-time job?
You would sit with colleagues to say even if they're from the opposing party that fine we want to do some research.
Do you think this is you know something that you have some research on.
>> And when I finished my stint with the WHO, um I had the privilege of introducing OS with zinc in our country.
At that time, what every year five lakh children were dying >> because of just bad water, because of diarrhea.
So my focus was very clear that can I contribute to stemming this?
Can I create more awareness about it?
>> So after that in 2003 is when I formally joined politics.
So whatever I would make as an actor part of it would go to do water projects in certain villages >> and those are knackel affected belt >> right >> and I had the late goat Mundai he told me he said you can keep doing any amount of social work but what is the penultimate goal I said the penultimate goal is to make a difference possibly through policy he said then you have to be a part of electoral politics >> and that's when I became a part of politics politics uh the BJP And do you think you being a recognizable face was an asset or was it in any way?
>> Uh it's not something where they go to the grassroots and work through the grassroots all the way up.
So when I came to active politics in 2003, I was a youthwing member of the BJP in Maharashtra.
I picked >> it's not how because you know >> because then you get to see the expanse of your country.
>> The other aspect is people think that oh I'll meet XYZ person who's a current leader and then become a politician.
The only time they'll approach a politician is if they're genuinely desperately in need of support, >> right?
It's a privilege and you should know it's a privilege and then respond to your parliamentary or constitutional duties accordingly.
I I knew what a great privilege it is.
So I was going to say the challenges of being young, inexperienced um a woman, an actress, you know, um did those were there any instances um that you found challenging because of that?
>> I think the attack against me where an attack is sexualized happened when I became ministered.
The opposition and especially people who want to curry favors with let's say an opposition leader would have very vile attacks on me.
Have you ever felt that you had to choose a time where for example you had to choose between being liked or respected?
Did something like that?
I know how futile that is.
>> Who in your family are you like?
>> Like who else?
But where does where does where does it come from?
>> Do you think it came from just >> being exposed to you think when you're alone as a kid?
I think when you're alone as a kid and like I said to lose my grandfather must have been one of those moments where I realized that if I'm so dependent on just his presence >> just that pat on the back and he's gone so I have the rest of my life so I I'm attuned to thinking like this that oh okay there's nobody >> so do you wait for that somebody to come along because then your life is about that weight >> right >> somebody very and an economist in fact dare I say has said this that in this modern world you have to be your own CEO CF1 one intern, >> right?
>> I think I realized that when I was a kid.
>> Yeah, there were some people who said that your style, your way of talking came across as arrogant.
which is not something which is celebrated when you're a politician.
>> Are politicians supposed to be good diplomats?
Like if it's are you supposed to be diplomatic?
>> The question should be is being diplomatic helping the constituency and the country.
when we go internationally to present ourselves, can we be abrasive >> in the face of vicious attacks >> uh diplomatically so on our country?
>> So it depends on what job has been assigned to you.
But I was very vehement about what I said between 14 and 19.
>> What do you think happened between 14 and 19 to help you secure that?
How did you spend that day when they were counting votes and >> on in 19 >> listening to music >> by yourself?
In my room >> and see and she asking people like what is the count?
>> Everybody was on the table from what 5:30 everybody ran 6:00 every on the table and they said to come.
I'm like >> no >> no because I knew what I'd done.
So I think he he's the only one who would have the audacity to call and literally shout, "Come out."
I'm like, "Why?
And they were like, "Why are you so stoic?"
Why aren't you excited?
>> You should not get so trapped with the jubilation >> that you don't see the next step.
They were like, "You know what a big thing it is."
>> And you slept?
I know things in in your time that I thought were remarkable that things that you may not have uh initiated but that you fought for that you fought for amendments for but touching on just a couple of them uh for example you know because you talked about malnutrition earlier as well the portion tracker app >> that was me >> that was you exactly that was you so how when that came in the difference that it made to children in >> oh when I became the minister I was told that there are 8 million children who are severely acutely malnourished and given my training by the prime minister I said show me the numbers and show me the evidenced position on the numbers >> somebody from UNICEF said oh but this is a supposition I said you are shaming my country on a supposition >> say can we start collecting data how will you collect data I said well the prime minister said every young body has to be digitally connected and everybody has a mobile phone so this heard what will we do?
So I said you pick your engineering team uh you pick your uh platform people and we'll sit together and let's see what we can get done.
Uh what else?
Um then what four five labs for farmers and yes I managed to get an airport under udan scheme along with cleaning up of nali.
So in your constituency you would give out that money in your constituency you will get that hawker to sit together.
I was there in the opposition when the Nirva case happened and again midnight we were um legislating on it.
What all have we done?
>> Um what over 20 cr calls answered, tracked even if they would repeatedly somebody would call it would get tracked.
There is a lot one could do and that's why I'm saying that the adulation you get as an actor is nothing.
How can I protect the rights of those who don't have a fancy paycheck?
>> Right?
>> But now with me around um people in production who otherwise would be a bit stern like she may just unionize them.
>> How do you how do you evaluate that gap?
The global gender gap index report speaks about this whole value that they bring to what is political empowerment of women.
They look at the women who are cabinet ministers.
They don't count the women who are in the council of ministers under the prime minister's leadership.
They don't count women who are ministers in state governments.
They don't count women who are elected to state legislative assemblies.
>> No, >> we have 1.4 million women as we speak today who are elected to punch.
>> Today you have close to 1 9 cr women who are in administrative services in our country.
>> 60 lakh are only those who are Asha and Angari workers.
So the issue that we need to ask and I've asked this of the world economic forum is uh if you don't count us if we are not spoken of does that mean we are not resilient enough or powerful enough?
>> So what did the letter say?
What they sent you?
>> I was witnessed when Rajnat Singh gi made it 33% reservation for women within the BJP possible.
>> We've had political organizations where women have led them >> but they haven't done this for other women.
>> But I want you to spell out for some people why it's important to have that >> because it gives you an even playing field to compete.
That is what you need right now.
Let's say just Mudra, >> right?
No, >> it's women from the smaller towns, villages who created a business plan.
>> Right?
>> Right?
So I believe that these are things which are not spoken of because for too long we were the country where people would just pat us on the head and say take care you know even >> you came from a fragile economy now suddenly you're the fourth largest >> what do you think the top three are going to do to you hug you?
No, >> they're going to elbow you out, >> right?
>> From all the various projects, initiatives, is there one that was closest to your heart?
>> And is there one story?
>> So I have kids and I used to write letters to kids who did well in you know the 10th and the 12th board exams.
>> How was the Guju started speaking to me in Gujarati?
>> And how do you Nobody can pick up any.
I remember when I messaged you, I said, I remember.
>> Really?
>> But I do meet a lot of people who have.
How?
Isn't life beautiful just when you're approachable?
>> You saw me on a street in London and we could just wave to each other.
And why did she?
>> So, is there something about you >> that makes people comfortable?
You should keep that.
>> How many hours at night do you sleep?
>> But it seems my cameraman says when I sleep for only 2 hours, I look better.
>> And do you have some kind of like uh self care?
>> You're like what?
What is that?
What do you mean?
>> No, I think as you >> look amazing, I would say.
I don't know how much me, but I just like the silences at times.
He's somebody who left home and earth for a larger purpose.
He has never picked up people who then don't become effective enough to serve that larger cause.
What I've learned, I've worked with him since 2002, 23 years now.
He teaches you how to work at the details.
He will remember what you said on that topic in 2007, what you did in 2016, and he would just look at you like, "No, I don't think so."
Um uh I mean for too long people in this country were told right what to do, how to do.
>> No politician should ever forget that this is a service.
>> I haven't finished it, but I'm reading it because then >> isn't it well written?
>> Um, so can you tell us a little bit about that?
>> I think that I have this great affinity to those who wear the uniform.
So what do you feel you would like to do next?
So what I seek is an opportunity to serve.
I'm mindful of the fact that I'm the first one from the industry who has served as education minister and written the education policy.
When co struck, I'm the textile minister who India never had a PPE kit industry.
Um what I've done in television is obviously marked in history but like I said if you ask me 2003 did I know I'd do all these things?
I think the one thing co taught us was like no matter what you plan, you need to respond to God's plan.
>> Just be grateful when you wake up the next day and say, "Okay, can I make this better for somebody?"
>> Can I be better than me?
And can I make this day a bit better for somebody else?
And I really do feel that we have very few role models when it comes to women >> in position.
Look at your father who may do much for you and never get seen.
Um some valuable takeaways I think of anybody who has aspirations to join public service and to perhaps give back to their country.
