[00:00:00.066 - 00:00:08.179] Host: What's the bigger blessing?
[00:00:08.199 - 00:00:09.821] Guest: Career success or your husband?
[00:00:09.841 - 00:00:11.704] Host: I think the bigger blessing is my husband.
[00:00:12.045 - 00:00:12.966] Host: Why?
[00:00:13.427 - 00:00:16.051] Host: Because if you achieve anything, you have no one to share it with.
[00:00:16.371 - 00:00:18.194] Host: You can't get happiness out of it.
[00:00:19.298 - 00:00:21.823] Guest: Which film did you show your children first?
[00:00:21.964 - 00:00:39.762] Host: How did you explain Madhuri Dixit to your own children?
[00:00:42.242 - 00:00:46.247] Guest: Your expressions during dancing, you were effortless in those moments.
[00:00:46.448 - 00:00:49.071] Host: People say that you are very natural, you do it effortlessly.
[00:00:49.151 - 00:00:53.497] Host: Not effortlessly, you didn't see how much effort is behind it.
[00:00:53.637 - 00:00:55.399] Host: Practicing for 5 hours, doing all this.
[00:00:55.419 - 00:00:57.082] Host: There was a lot of effort behind everything.
[00:00:58.824 - 00:01:01.928] Guest: When you used to act, you used to get so much love from expressions.
[00:01:02.048 - 00:01:04.692] Guest: So you must have become more romantic.
[00:01:04.992 - 00:01:06.694] Host: Yes, I love to love.
[00:01:06.774 - 00:01:09.618] Host: Just thinking about love is like romantic to me.
[00:01:10.018 - 00:01:15.867] Host: If you give me a stone, I can romance a stone also.
[00:01:15.887 - 00:01:20.694] Guest: Is it right to just work hard and keep moving forward and then wait for destiny to happen?
[00:01:20.955 - 00:01:23.318] Host: If you're working hard, you're not waiting for destiny to happen.
[00:01:23.759 - 00:01:31.471] Host: If you're sitting at home and not doing anything, saying that I should get something like this, then that's wrong.
[00:01:31.992 - 00:01:33.554] Guest: What was the experience of fame for you?
[00:01:33.666 - 00:01:36.152] Guest: And after that you went to USA.
[00:01:36.172 - 00:01:39.780] Host: The fame, the way I used to go home, I used to leave it outside the door.
[00:01:39.800 - 00:01:41.043] Host: I was very romantic.
[00:01:41.144 - 00:01:43.730] Host: I wanted a house and a husband and kids.
[00:01:43.770 - 00:01:45.313] Host: That was a big part of my dream.
[00:01:45.333 - 00:01:47.779] Host: So when I went there, I was living my dream.
[00:01:47.940 - 00:01:50.706] Host: I was not missing anything in my life.
[00:02:12.354 - 00:02:16.520] Guest: I think of a lot of things for every episode.
[00:02:16.540 - 00:02:18.924] Guest: I think of a lot of things for every guest.
[00:02:19.064 - 00:02:22.970] Guest: I can see only one word in my mind and that word is magic.
[00:02:22.990 - 00:02:25.093] Guest: Today, this episode is going to be magical.
[00:02:25.213 - 00:02:25.694] Guest: With Madhuri Dixit.
[00:02:26.595 - 00:02:27.717] Guest: How are you, ma'am?
[00:02:27.737 - 00:02:28.819] Host: I am absolutely fine.
[00:02:28.839 - 00:02:29.780] Guest: How are you?
[00:02:30.141 - 00:02:31.322] Guest: I am feeling good.
[00:02:31.463 - 00:02:32.724] Guest: This is a very good life moment.
[00:02:33.506 - 00:02:37.171] Guest: That I am getting a chance to talk to you.
[00:02:37.191 - 00:02:41.177] Guest: And I know that people will watch this episode for the next 30 years.
[00:02:41.197 - 00:02:41.778] Guest: I know that.
[00:02:41.922 - 00:02:42.463] Host: My God!
[00:02:42.483 - 00:02:43.024] Host: 30 years.
[00:02:43.304 - 00:02:45.026] Host: It's been 30 years.
[00:02:45.046 - 00:02:47.950] Guest: I can see this number for 30 years.
[00:02:48.551 - 00:02:48.972] Host: Okay.
[00:02:49.312 - 00:02:49.553] Guest: Why?
[00:02:49.573 - 00:02:50.754] Host: Do you think so?
[00:02:51.415 - 00:02:52.937] Host: I don't know.
[00:02:54.139 - 00:02:59.406] Host: I have worked in this industry for 40 years.
[00:02:59.426 - 00:02:59.647] Host: Wow!
[00:02:59.667 - 00:03:00.648] Host: Yeah, these are 40 years.
[00:03:01.369 - 00:03:04.173] Host: And I have lived very well.
[00:03:04.273 - 00:03:04.994] Host: People have liked me a lot.
[00:03:05.014 - 00:03:07.438] Host: Even today, I have fans.
[00:03:07.458 - 00:03:10.302] Host: 30 years more.
[00:03:10.322 - 00:03:10.642] Host: Let's see.
[00:03:10.722 - 00:03:12.604] Guest: There are so many questions for you.
[00:03:12.625 - 00:03:15.288] Guest: Like genuine questions.
[00:03:16.710 - 00:03:23.058] Guest: I mean, the silly question is that I would like to ask about your skincare routine.
[00:03:23.078 - 00:03:26.122] Guest: Actually, there is a light on your face.
[00:03:26.142 - 00:03:29.988] Guest: And I am not just saying that now because you are in front of me.
[00:03:30.468 - 00:03:35.194] Guest: This was genuinely my thought in my childhood when I saw Diltopagalaya.
[00:03:35.214 - 00:03:37.938] Guest: Why does this queen have light coming out of her?
[00:03:38.530 - 00:03:41.796] Guest: I would like to connect that same thought with skincare.
[00:03:42.557 - 00:04:03.292] Host: Actually, no matter how much you apply skincare, but till you don't have that thing inside, a positivity, you know, a calmness or a view of life, you know, that beauty is not skin deep, it comes from inside.
[00:04:03.452 - 00:04:04.594] Host: It's from inside.
[00:04:04.738 - 00:04:06.920] Host: And that is something else you have to work on.
[00:04:07.321 - 00:04:09.683] Host: Not just putting lotions and potions on your face.
[00:04:09.724 - 00:04:11.225] Guest: What is your perspective on life?
[00:04:11.245 - 00:04:13.408] Host: I mean, very positive about everything.
[00:04:15.109 - 00:04:16.952] Host: I never think negatively about anyone.
[00:04:18.593 - 00:04:19.634] Host: I love to meet people.
[00:04:19.935 - 00:04:20.596] Host: I love people.
[00:04:20.616 - 00:04:23.118] Host: I love to talk to people.
[00:04:24.340 - 00:04:25.401] Host: To know about others.
[00:04:25.421 - 00:04:27.043] Host: To know about their lives.
[00:04:27.063 - 00:04:30.066] Host: And...
[00:04:30.626 - 00:04:34.953] Host: Like I said, what I am, who I am, it never affects me.
[00:04:35.874 - 00:04:40.542] Host: Because I am very simple, I am very down to earth, very positive kind of a person.
[00:04:41.103 - 00:04:42.084] Host: I think that also helps.
[00:04:42.104 - 00:04:46.111] Host: And sometimes I do a little bit of meditation also.
[00:04:46.531 - 00:04:47.773] Host: This is also very important.
[00:04:47.793 - 00:04:49.896] Host: It's very very important to meditate.
[00:04:50.517 - 00:04:54.083] Host: Either I do Omkar or I love Gayatri Mantra.
[00:04:54.103 - 00:04:55.245] Host: So I say Gayatri Mantra.
[00:04:55.365 - 00:04:55.786] Guest: Okay.
[00:04:56.126 - 00:04:56.707] Guest: Sometimes.
[00:04:57.569 - 00:04:58.450] Host: Whenever I feel like.
[00:04:58.786 - 00:05:02.650] Host: And that can happen if you do it twice a day or twice a week.
[00:05:02.670 - 00:05:05.112] Host: Sometimes you do it every day in a week.
[00:05:05.132 - 00:05:06.914] Host: So it depends on what.
[00:05:07.014 - 00:05:14.481] Guest: For the preparation of this conversation, I watched your old rendezvous with Simi Garival episode.
[00:05:14.561 - 00:05:15.802] Guest: You were still very evolved.
[00:05:16.062 - 00:05:17.204] Guest: I think it was roughly 2002-2003.
[00:05:17.224 - 00:05:26.993] Guest: And honestly, before watching that episode, I thought I would have an artsy conversation with you.
[00:05:27.333 - 00:05:28.274] Guest: We've talked about life.
[00:05:28.450 - 00:05:30.213] Guest: In that episode, I saw your intensity.
[00:05:30.333 - 00:05:33.278] Guest: You have worked very hard to become Madhuri Dixit.
[00:05:33.298 - 00:05:35.982] Guest: At that time, a film was being released.
[00:05:36.282 - 00:05:39.447] Guest: I also wanted to become Madhuri Dixit.
[00:05:39.467 - 00:05:41.751] Guest: I wanted to become Madhuri Dixit.
[00:05:41.771 - 00:05:44.756] Guest: So, Simi Garewal ma'am asked you how you had done it.
[00:05:45.597 - 00:05:47.460] Guest: And all your intensity came out.
[00:05:47.480 - 00:05:48.922] Guest: That you have worked very hard.
[00:05:49.023 - 00:05:50.865] Guest: You treated every film like it's your last.
[00:05:50.926 - 00:05:51.126] Guest: Yes.
[00:05:51.787 - 00:05:53.950] Guest: Where did that intensity come from?
[00:05:53.970 - 00:05:56.274] Host: I mean, it's in me.
[00:05:56.610 - 00:06:02.018] Host: I have been learning Kathak since I was 3 years old.
[00:06:02.038 - 00:06:05.203] Host: We used to practice it for 2 hours every day.
[00:06:05.703 - 00:06:08.548] Host: Sometimes 1 hour, sometimes 2 hours.
[00:06:08.568 - 00:06:10.811] Host: And I worked very hard for it.
[00:06:12.033 - 00:06:15.698] Host: In school also, whatever I had to do, I used to work hard at everything that I did.
[00:06:16.359 - 00:06:20.005] Host: So I have learned it from my parents.
[00:06:20.565 - 00:06:21.907] Host: That you have to work hard in life.
[00:06:22.709 - 00:06:26.354] Host: And treat everything as if this is my last.
[00:06:26.850 - 00:06:29.913] Host: I don't know about tomorrow, but today is something I live for.
[00:06:30.413 - 00:06:31.895] Host: So, everyday I am living for today.
[00:06:32.415 - 00:06:35.198] Host: So, if I am doing this interview, I will not do it flippantly.
[00:06:35.838 - 00:06:37.240] Host: I will never be unattentive.
[00:06:37.640 - 00:06:40.103] Host: I will not say, do it, say anything.
[00:06:40.643 - 00:06:42.605] Host: So, I will always give it my all.
[00:06:43.065 - 00:06:44.146] Host: Whatever I do in it.
[00:06:45.368 - 00:06:46.489] Guest: You are a hundred percent.
[00:06:46.509 - 00:06:47.630] Host: Yes, a hundred percent.
[00:06:47.690 - 00:06:48.030] Host: Always.
[00:06:48.070 - 00:06:49.652] Guest: And that's why you moved forward?
[00:06:50.532 - 00:06:52.674] Host: Of course, you should get success too.
[00:06:52.694 - 00:06:53.775] Host: Then you move forward.
[00:06:53.795 - 00:06:56.498] Host: When you... You have to work hard.
[00:06:56.802 - 00:06:59.446] Host: But when you get success, you move forward.
[00:06:59.746 - 00:07:00.647] Host: Then you work hard.
[00:07:00.667 - 00:07:02.590] Host: When you get success, you move forward.
[00:07:02.610 - 00:07:09.660] Host: But at every step, you should always have self-awareness.
[00:07:09.860 - 00:07:15.388] Host: You should always think about what to do next.
[00:07:15.828 - 00:07:23.058] Host: So I think all these factors add to how you lead your life.
[00:07:24.642 - 00:07:29.469] Guest: I want to get rid of some random tangents from my mind and then we move forward.
[00:07:29.489 - 00:07:31.392] Guest: This may not be value-adding for the audience.
[00:07:31.412 - 00:07:34.176] Host: I am doing this for myself.
[00:07:34.236 - 00:07:36.319] Host: You should do this for yourself too.
[00:07:36.339 - 00:07:39.123] Guest: But I feel very bad.
[00:07:39.404 - 00:07:39.924] Guest: Not bad.
[00:07:39.944 - 00:07:43.790] Guest: I feel very boring when people give me bouquets.
[00:07:44.030 - 00:07:45.512] Guest: Bouquets?
[00:07:45.573 - 00:07:49.298] Guest: I feel it's a very cliched thing to give someone a bouquet.
[00:07:49.922 - 00:07:52.085] Host: You think he's not well thought out.
[00:07:52.485 - 00:07:53.627] Host: You took the easiest way out.
[00:07:53.807 - 00:07:54.688] Host: That he takes bouquets.
[00:07:54.849 - 00:07:56.331] Guest: It's a very generic thing.
[00:07:56.411 - 00:07:58.794] Guest: That someone is given bouquets in every event.
[00:07:59.214 - 00:08:01.217] Guest: And I don't think there's any thought behind it.
[00:08:01.798 - 00:08:02.299] Guest: Okay?
[00:08:02.319 - 00:08:03.660] Guest: So you have to give one thing.
[00:08:04.962 - 00:08:06.925] Guest: But please don't look at it as a bouquet.
[00:08:06.965 - 00:08:08.046] Guest: Just look at it as flowers.
[00:08:10.089 - 00:08:11.291] Host: I mean, it's getting worse.
[00:08:13.113 - 00:08:14.515] Host: You want me to think differently.
[00:08:14.895 - 00:08:16.818] Host: Oh, thank you so much.
[00:08:16.898 - 00:08:19.542] Host: Well, at least I can think they're all roses.
[00:08:19.562 - 00:08:20.743] Guest: And pink roses.
[00:08:20.843 - 00:08:21.404] Guest: Thank you.
[00:08:21.745 - 00:08:22.506] Guest: That's very sweet.
[00:08:22.526 - 00:08:23.507] Guest: Thank you for getting the thought.
[00:08:24.208 - 00:08:25.890] Guest: I had to land this thought.
[00:08:26.331 - 00:08:27.472] Guest: That's from my childhood to you.
[00:08:28.013 - 00:08:28.754] Host: Oh, how lovely.
[00:08:29.055 - 00:08:32.860] Guest: So, just really wanted to give this and get it out of the way.
[00:08:32.880 - 00:08:34.182] Host: Your childhood was very pinky-pinky.
[00:08:35.583 - 00:08:35.664] Unknown: Yes.
[00:08:35.684 - 00:08:36.785] Guest: These flowers remind me of you.
[00:08:37.126 - 00:08:38.307] Guest: Or you remind me of these flowers.
[00:08:38.327 - 00:08:41.451] Guest: I thought of bringing sunflowers or lilies.
[00:08:41.472 - 00:08:43.394] Guest: But I wanted to give you pink roses.
[00:08:43.755 - 00:08:44.195] Host: How sweet.
[00:08:44.235 - 00:08:46.258] Host: So, it's not like completely not thought out.
[00:08:46.466 - 00:08:47.888] Guest: It's well thought out.
[00:08:47.908 - 00:08:51.134] Guest: You brought this flower after a lot of thought.
[00:08:51.755 - 00:08:52.476] Host: Thank you so much.
[00:08:52.496 - 00:08:53.798] Host: That's very sweet.
[00:08:54.279 - 00:08:59.587] Guest: But sometimes I feel that so many people have done such crazy things for you.
[00:08:59.607 - 00:09:00.589] Guest: What is this flower for you?
[00:09:01.330 - 00:09:02.913] Guest: Like people have made your paintings.
[00:09:02.933 - 00:09:05.056] Guest: You have been their muse.
[00:09:06.458 - 00:09:08.241] Guest: How did you process that?
[00:09:11.126 - 00:09:13.650] Host: I think I processed that as...
[00:09:14.690 - 00:09:16.513] Host: accolades from one artist to another.
[00:09:17.054 - 00:09:19.898] Host: For example, an artist praised another artist.
[00:09:20.419 - 00:09:23.805] Host: So, because of that, they made a muse.
[00:09:23.825 - 00:09:27.530] Host: They used my persona in their paintings.
[00:09:28.572 - 00:09:30.074] Guest: Specifically, you're talking about M.F.
[00:09:30.095 - 00:09:30.255] Host: Hussain.
[00:09:30.575 - 00:09:30.816] Host: Yes, M.F.
[00:09:30.836 - 00:09:31.316] Host: Hussain.
[00:09:31.617 - 00:09:39.429] Host: And he made a series of paintings in which I am a character of his painting.
[00:09:40.010 - 00:09:42.354] Host: So, I think it's like a compliment.
[00:09:42.594 - 00:09:44.837] Host: from one artist to another.
[00:09:44.857 - 00:09:55.889] Host: And I've become a fan of his art as well because I knew Hussain used to paint a lot of horses and that was in my mind when I met him for the first time.
[00:09:56.670 - 00:09:58.592] Host: And when he...
[00:09:58.612 - 00:10:08.724] Host: When such a big artist tells you that he liked your film, he told me about every nuance of your film.
[00:10:09.665 - 00:10:10.706] Host: So...
[00:10:10.882 - 00:10:13.265] Host: I was flattered.
[00:10:14.006 - 00:10:17.792] Host: But flattered is a very shallow word.
[00:10:18.553 - 00:10:20.335] Host: I was very grateful.
[00:10:20.395 - 00:10:21.196] Host: I was very happy.
[00:10:21.797 - 00:10:24.681] Guest: Do you still get flattered at all?
[00:10:28.426 - 00:10:30.209] Host: It's always good to hear compliments.
[00:10:30.589 - 00:10:33.013] Host: If someone compliments you, it feels good.
[00:10:33.233 - 00:10:36.337] Host: Because it's a positive... ...feedback.
[00:10:36.357 - 00:10:37.379] Host: It's a positive energy.
[00:10:38.220 - 00:10:39.922] Host: And...
[00:10:40.162 - 00:10:41.364] Host: Yeah, I like compliments.
[00:10:41.504 - 00:10:41.885] Host: Why not?
[00:10:43.708 - 00:10:46.793] Guest: The compliments will come as we move forward.
[00:10:46.813 - 00:10:49.597] Guest: I hope the flowers are digested as a compliment.
[00:10:49.938 - 00:10:50.699] Guest: It is.
[00:10:50.719 - 00:10:52.362] Guest: Thank you so much.
[00:10:52.382 - 00:10:55.246] Guest: Which film did you show your children first?
[00:10:55.286 - 00:10:57.871] Host: You know, it's not like that.
[00:10:57.911 - 00:10:59.694] Host: It's not like that at home.
[00:10:59.754 - 00:11:01.276] Host: Come kids, watch my film.
[00:11:01.677 - 00:11:02.238] Host: It's not like that.
[00:11:02.258 - 00:11:04.882] Guest: That's not life.
[00:11:05.218 - 00:11:08.382] Guest: When did this conversation happen and what did you tell?
[00:11:08.422 - 00:11:11.006] Guest: Like how did you explain Madhuri Dixit to your own children?
[00:11:11.446 - 00:11:13.489] Host: Well, they didn't know anything till we moved here.
[00:11:13.769 - 00:11:15.612] Host: And we were going in the car.
[00:11:15.632 - 00:11:16.813] Host: We went to watch a movie in the PVR.
[00:11:16.833 - 00:11:19.076] Host: When we came out, there were so many photographers.
[00:11:19.096 - 00:11:21.820] Host: They got confused as to what was happening.
[00:11:21.840 - 00:11:22.942] Host: They were clicking like that.
[00:11:23.362 - 00:11:24.944] Host: And they were like, Mom, Mom, Mom.
[00:11:25.164 - 00:11:26.767] Host: The poor guy got confused.
[00:11:26.787 - 00:11:29.330] Host: Then we went home and asked them, Mom, what's happening?
[00:11:29.442 - 00:11:30.844] Host: So I said, this is how it is.
[00:11:30.864 - 00:11:34.410] Host: I am an actress and that's why they wanted pictures with all of us together.
[00:11:34.450 - 00:11:36.153] Guest: They didn't have any idea?
[00:11:36.173 - 00:11:36.994] Host: They didn't know much.
[00:11:37.014 - 00:11:38.877] Host: They were 6 and 8 when we moved here.
[00:11:39.358 - 00:11:44.466] Host: And when we were there, there was no influence of all this.
[00:11:44.486 - 00:11:45.908] Host: Then I slowly realized who I am.
[00:11:46.048 - 00:11:48.873] Host: Because in school some kids come and say, you are so lucky.
[00:11:49.334 - 00:11:50.335] Host: They are like, why?
[00:11:50.355 - 00:11:54.963] Host: Because your mother is Madhuri Dixit, you are very lucky.
[00:11:55.083 - 00:11:57.106] Host: But mom, you are a mom.
[00:11:57.314 - 00:11:58.916] Host: He said, yes, I am your mom.
[00:11:59.096 - 00:12:00.597] Host: Why is he saying you are lucky?
[00:12:03.820 - 00:12:05.061] Host: So, such incidents used to happen.
[00:12:05.102 - 00:12:08.705] Host: But now, I mean, I think they have seen more of my films after they went to college.
[00:12:09.346 - 00:12:10.226] Host: Because of their friends.
[00:12:11.608 - 00:12:17.754] Host: Because of their Indian friends, they have seen more movies of mine than they have their entire life.
[00:12:17.774 - 00:12:20.837] Guest: If I was Madhuri Dixit, I would show all my filmography to my kids.
[00:12:22.198 - 00:12:24.080] Guest: But I am not Madhuri Dixit.
[00:12:24.100 - 00:12:26.322] Host: If you were Madhuri Dixit, you had kids you would not have.
[00:12:26.594 - 00:12:28.156] Host: That's what happens.
[00:12:28.176 - 00:12:29.858] Host: It doesn't happen at home.
[00:12:29.878 - 00:12:29.978] Unknown: Okay.
[00:12:29.998 - 00:12:32.221] Guest: Have you seen Dil Toh Pagal Hai?
[00:12:32.241 - 00:12:33.442] Host: He's seen it recently.
[00:12:33.483 - 00:12:35.105] Host: My older guy has seen it recently.
[00:12:35.125 - 00:12:35.825] Host: Dil Toh Pagal Hai.
[00:12:35.886 - 00:12:36.947] Guest: What did he say after watching it?
[00:12:37.447 - 00:12:38.669] Host: He loved the movie.
[00:12:38.869 - 00:12:42.013] Host: He said, Mom, how come you never showed us this movie?
[00:12:42.033 - 00:12:45.898] Host: I said, were you ever interested in watching these movies?
[00:12:45.918 - 00:12:49.202] Host: Because either they used to be watching cartoons or superhero movies, right?
[00:12:49.442 - 00:12:51.786] Host: They didn't, and they didn't understand Hindi.
[00:12:51.806 - 00:12:57.614] Host: After they moved here, now they just started talking in Marathi and Hindi and all that.
[00:12:57.735 - 00:12:59.718] Host: Till then they didn't know Hindi.
[00:13:00.539 - 00:13:05.146] Guest: There are some people who have visualized being on the show a lot.
[00:13:05.166 - 00:13:08.872] Guest: So you're definitely in that category.
[00:13:09.012 - 00:13:12.277] Guest: It's also an outcome of life because I feel that this is art for us.
[00:13:12.297 - 00:13:13.899] Guest: And art is often an outcome of childhood.
[00:13:14.600 - 00:13:16.703] Guest: So many times the heart has seen the crazy.
[00:13:16.724 - 00:13:18.386] Guest: Who have we seen in you?
[00:13:18.562 - 00:13:21.185] Guest: I'm sure you're used to these kinds of things from people.
[00:13:21.225 - 00:13:21.786] Guest: That oh we love you.
[00:13:21.806 - 00:13:27.792] Host: It's always great to know that your art has had an impact somewhere in your life.
[00:13:28.693 - 00:13:29.454] Host: You know.
[00:13:29.514 - 00:13:34.139] Host: Because for you it was a role that you played.
[00:13:34.159 - 00:13:37.904] Host: But many people come and say, oh my heart is crazy.
[00:13:38.044 - 00:13:40.947] Host: At that time I met my girlfriend, we met in the theatre.
[00:13:40.967 - 00:13:45.012] Host: And from there we fell in love from there.
[00:13:45.833 - 00:13:47.154] Host: Or they say that
[00:13:47.426 - 00:13:52.751] Host: After watching Majama, many families kind of got back together.
[00:13:53.051 - 00:13:53.312] Host: You know.
[00:13:54.092 - 00:14:02.621] Host: Or after watching Hum Aap Ke Kon, some memories that came, that touched them, that reminded them of their daughter.
[00:14:02.641 - 00:14:03.662] Host: This happened in our house too.
[00:14:03.682 - 00:14:04.623] Host: You know, those kind of things.
[00:14:05.263 - 00:14:07.065] Host: This impact is more important.
[00:14:07.205 - 00:14:08.626] Host: The impact of art.
[00:14:08.646 - 00:14:12.310] Host: Yes, the impact of art on people's lives is more important.
[00:14:12.350 - 00:14:14.532] Host: And that's what I love to hear about.
[00:14:15.153 - 00:14:16.594] Guest: Are you aware that
[00:14:16.962 - 00:14:29.037] Guest: All the Kathak training classes, or if there is a high level of dancing training, a lot of coaches tell you to dance like Madhuri Dixit.
[00:14:29.057 - 00:14:29.858] Guest: You're aware of this?
[00:14:30.359 - 00:14:32.442] Guest: A lot of my friends are trained dancers.
[00:14:32.922 - 00:14:34.865] Guest: I spoke to them about this episode.
[00:14:35.546 - 00:14:40.191] Guest: And they told me that this is the level of the art that's been showcased.
[00:14:40.872 - 00:14:42.194] Guest: So, you know this?
[00:14:42.306 - 00:14:43.327] Host: That's very sweet.
[00:14:43.407 - 00:14:48.794] Host: I mean, of course, people come and tell me that we do your dances, we follow you.
[00:14:48.814 - 00:14:53.000] Host: The way you form your body, we have to do that.
[00:14:55.483 - 00:14:58.827] Host: But my ideals are different.
[00:14:58.868 - 00:15:00.430] Host: The ones I want to follow.
[00:15:00.750 - 00:15:03.974] Host: Like Maharaj Ji, Birju Maharaj Ji or Saroj Khan.
[00:15:03.994 - 00:15:06.477] Host: These are my gurus.
[00:15:06.598 - 00:15:07.479] Host: I follow them.
[00:15:07.499 - 00:15:10.002] Host: So, I think...
[00:15:10.434 - 00:15:18.102] Host: Like I was saying about impact, this is another impact with your art, the impact you can create for people.
[00:15:18.162 - 00:15:22.807] Host: That they think this is the ideal, this is how we have to do it.
[00:15:22.827 - 00:15:23.928] Host: I have worked hard for that.
[00:15:25.090 - 00:15:27.432] Host: You know, rehearsed a lot for the songs.
[00:15:28.233 - 00:15:36.562] Host: When I worked with Saroj Ji, we had decided that because the first song we did together, Teza, that became such a big hit.
[00:15:36.674 - 00:15:40.359] Host: So I knew that we were going to do a lot of songs together.
[00:15:40.980 - 00:15:43.984] Host: So we made a pact by the third or fourth song.
[00:15:44.004 - 00:15:46.087] Host: We won't repeat the steps.
[00:15:46.107 - 00:15:48.831] Host: We will do something new for people every time when we come together.
[00:15:49.392 - 00:15:51.415] Host: So those kind of things which we thought about.
[00:15:51.895 - 00:16:00.327] Host: I think when people say these things, I feel that the thought that we had and the effort that we had brought that color.
[00:16:00.468 - 00:16:02.070] Host: It was worth it all the time.
[00:16:02.230 - 00:16:05.074] Guest: Yes.
[00:16:05.282 - 00:16:09.189] Guest: Algorithms have become very powerful these days.
[00:16:09.209 - 00:16:21.109] Guest: So, when you reach the algorithms of people, it's often related to your expressions during dancing and your expressions while performing.
[00:16:22.952 - 00:16:24.795] Guest: What was going on inside you?
[00:16:24.815 - 00:16:31.506] Guest: Because I tried analyzing a lot of your performances and I felt that this is a very
[00:16:32.514 - 00:16:40.307] Guest: there is an identity of hardworking artist that there is a lot going on in the background but on the surface, pure art is being displayed.
[00:16:40.988 - 00:16:44.535] Guest: Am I right in saying that or you were effortless in those moments?
[00:16:44.875 - 00:16:45.116] Host: No, no.
[00:16:45.136 - 00:16:48.361] Host: To look effortless, it takes a lot of effort.
[00:16:48.882 - 00:16:55.954] Host: Even Roger Federer, who is a tennis player, once said in an interview, the same thing which I believe a lot that
[00:16:56.034 - 00:16:59.398] Host: They said, you are very natural, you do it effortlessly.
[00:16:59.498 - 00:17:00.720] Host: I said, effortlessly?
[00:17:00.740 - 00:17:01.240] Host: No.
[00:17:01.340 - 00:17:02.922] Host: You didn't see how much effort is behind it.
[00:17:03.022 - 00:17:04.785] Host: It took 5-5 hours.
[00:17:04.845 - 00:17:06.707] Host: You know, practicing, doing all this.
[00:17:06.727 - 00:17:10.772] Host: So, behind every song, there was practice, involvement.
[00:17:12.674 - 00:17:14.496] Host: Behind every scene, you know.
[00:17:16.719 - 00:17:18.962] Host: When you practice it, it looks effortless when you do it.
[00:17:19.242 - 00:17:20.043] Host: You know.
[00:17:20.063 - 00:17:23.227] Host: So, there was a lot of effort behind everything.
[00:17:23.287 - 00:17:25.810] Guest: Because of that effort, did your heart ever get affected?
[00:17:26.594 - 00:17:28.517] Guest: Did your mental health get affected?
[00:17:28.537 - 00:17:32.223] Guest: Or did you put pressure on yourself?
[00:17:32.383 - 00:17:32.623] Host: Yes.
[00:17:33.705 - 00:17:35.288] Host: Because I always want to do my best.
[00:17:35.808 - 00:17:37.691] Host: Whatever I do, it should look good.
[00:17:37.711 - 00:17:41.597] Host: So, there is a lot of thought behind it.
[00:17:41.678 - 00:17:45.584] Host: Then what happens when you do such work?
[00:17:45.744 - 00:17:47.306] Host: There can be a lot of disappointment.
[00:17:47.326 - 00:17:52.274] Host: Because if something doesn't work, you worked so hard, but it didn't work.
[00:17:52.610 - 00:17:57.455] Host: But I think my mother was a very strong personality in my life.
[00:17:57.535 - 00:17:58.636] Host: And she was my backbone.
[00:17:59.176 - 00:18:00.397] Host: So she taught me a lot of strength.
[00:18:00.798 - 00:18:02.399] Host: And she has taught me to be strong.
[00:18:03.280 - 00:18:05.522] Host: You know, how to be strong.
[00:18:05.542 - 00:18:11.888] Host: So even through failures, how you treat failures, that also decides what kind of a person you are.
[00:18:12.269 - 00:18:21.938] Host: So for me, whether it's success or failure, success is the same, failure is the same.
[00:18:22.114 - 00:18:24.618] Host: There's a balance which you need to have in life.
[00:18:24.638 - 00:18:26.361] Host: And my mother taught me that.
[00:18:27.242 - 00:18:29.205] Guest: Did your mother take care of you?
[00:18:29.226 - 00:18:32.751] Host: Yes, she took care of me a lot.
[00:18:32.771 - 00:18:36.097] Guest: For example, in the 90s, how was your life behind the scenes?
[00:18:36.858 - 00:18:37.839] Guest: Like what was it like?
[00:18:37.860 - 00:18:39.702] Host: Hectic, very hectic.
[00:18:39.723 - 00:18:42.547] Host: Because we used to do two shifts there.
[00:18:42.567 - 00:18:44.691] Host: How do we do one film at one time?
[00:18:45.251 - 00:18:47.014] Host: So that film ends in three months.
[00:18:47.475 - 00:18:49.298] Host: Then you move on to the next project, right?
[00:18:49.602 - 00:18:52.066] Host: But we used to do multiple projects at the same time.
[00:18:52.086 - 00:18:54.670] Host: For example, there used to be 8 films.
[00:18:54.710 - 00:18:57.334] Host: There used to be 9 films.
[00:18:57.354 - 00:18:59.457] Host: So, their schedules used to never be organized.
[00:19:00.279 - 00:19:01.641] Host: That means...
[00:19:01.661 - 00:19:03.043] Host: Okay, we have to shoot now.
[00:19:03.063 - 00:19:04.726] Host: The producer has come.
[00:19:05.427 - 00:19:06.629] Host: He has to shoot now.
[00:19:06.669 - 00:19:09.854] Host: The shooting has been done for 10 days.
[00:19:09.874 - 00:19:11.176] Host: So, he is going to shoot next month.
[00:19:11.697 - 00:19:13.399] Host: But now, it's clashing with somebody else.
[00:19:13.419 - 00:19:14.641] Host: We are already given dates too.
[00:19:15.182 - 00:19:17.746] Host: So, what we used to do is split the day between the two.
[00:19:18.178 - 00:19:20.501] Host: So, half a day for her and half a day for her.
[00:19:20.521 - 00:19:22.243] Host: So, two shifts were done.
[00:19:22.263 - 00:19:22.504] Host: You know.
[00:19:22.844 - 00:19:24.386] Host: So, we have done work like that.
[00:19:24.466 - 00:19:26.829] Host: So, a lot of hard work and a lot.
[00:19:27.250 - 00:19:29.212] Host: So, to have a mom in my life was...
[00:19:29.232 - 00:19:31.455] Host: I mean, it was a boon for me.
[00:19:31.475 - 00:19:33.438] Host: It was a blessing.
[00:19:33.478 - 00:19:37.082] Host: Because whenever I got tired or something happened that I was frustrated about something.
[00:19:37.703 - 00:19:40.787] Host: So, my mom's presence was very calming.
[00:19:41.027 - 00:19:42.890] Host: Soothing, you know.
[00:19:42.910 - 00:19:43.571] Guest: And...
[00:19:43.591 - 00:19:44.332] Guest: In the chaos.
[00:19:45.233 - 00:19:46.194] Host: Yes, in the chaos.
[00:19:46.594 - 00:19:47.255] Host: You're right.
[00:19:47.435 - 00:19:50.659] Host: And I always used to fall back on her.
[00:19:51.400 - 00:19:55.386] Host: And she was... She was a dynamo, actually.
[00:19:57.509 - 00:19:58.490] Guest: Silly question.
[00:19:58.510 - 00:20:04.598] Guest: But mid-90s or early 90s... Did you ever think of becoming a doctor?
[00:20:04.618 - 00:20:07.722] Guest: Like a husband?
[00:20:07.742 - 00:20:09.044] Guest: Or marriage?
[00:20:09.064 - 00:20:11.347] Host: Far from my thought.
[00:20:11.367 - 00:20:13.650] Host: I never thought of it.
[00:20:13.762 - 00:20:19.448] Host: And my siblings were always there to try to match make, you know, me.
[00:20:19.468 - 00:20:23.432] Host: So, there's a friend of mine... How does it feel?
[00:20:23.613 - 00:20:24.113] Host: What does it feel like?
[00:20:24.574 - 00:20:25.955] Host: I'm like, don't even dare do that.
[00:20:26.416 - 00:20:27.877] Host: I'm not interested right now.
[00:20:28.138 - 00:20:28.678] Host: Why?
[00:20:28.738 - 00:20:30.340] Host: Because I loved what I did.
[00:20:30.400 - 00:20:36.226] Host: My career was like... Every day was fun and I used to feel that...
[00:20:36.807 - 00:20:38.128] Host: I don't know...
[00:20:38.148 - 00:20:41.532] Host: If I meet a wrong person, then the fun is all gone, you know.
[00:20:42.293 - 00:20:43.314] Host: And...
[00:20:43.458 - 00:20:46.582] Host: I didn't, really I just loved what I was doing at that point.
[00:20:46.602 - 00:20:53.131] Host: So, I never thought that anybody dreams that there will be a prince who will come.
[00:20:53.171 - 00:20:54.233] Host: You know, those kind of things.
[00:20:54.273 - 00:20:56.316] Host: Prince and fairytale kind of a thing.
[00:20:56.716 - 00:20:59.320] Host: For me, I was having too much fun doing what I was doing.
[00:21:00.662 - 00:21:06.049] Guest: And I am thinking that when you used to act, you used to get so much love from expressions or on screen.
[00:21:06.870 - 00:21:12.338] Guest: So, you must have become more romantic because of your own roles.
[00:21:12.738 - 00:21:13.920] Guest: Yeah, because of your work.
[00:21:13.940 - 00:21:15.782] Guest: Was the love energy also increasing?
[00:21:15.982 - 00:21:21.270] Host: Yes, the love towards my work and just the love I have in my heart.
[00:21:21.390 - 00:21:24.794] Host: Not for... Not for a particular, not the hero standing in front of me.
[00:21:24.855 - 00:21:25.455] Host: No, not like that.
[00:21:25.515 - 00:21:26.056] Host: Just love.
[00:21:26.377 - 00:21:28.299] Host: Just love, you know.
[00:21:28.640 - 00:21:30.182] Host: I love to love.
[00:21:30.262 - 00:21:33.166] Host: Just thinking about love is like romantic to me.
[00:21:33.667 - 00:21:35.649] Host: So, you give me a stone in front of me.
[00:21:35.669 - 00:21:38.753] Host: So, I can romance a stone also.
[00:21:38.834 - 00:21:40.816] Guest: Now, I want to say something to the audience.
[00:21:40.836 - 00:21:41.978] Guest: I spent time with Dr. Nene.
[00:21:42.018 - 00:21:42.098] Unknown: Yes.
[00:21:42.210 - 00:21:51.562] Guest: I think you have cast a spell on them because no husband talks so much romantically about their wife in my experience.
[00:21:51.662 - 00:21:52.723] Guest: I have not met another man.
[00:21:52.844 - 00:21:56.949] Host: See, I am so fortunate that I have met a romantic man.
[00:21:56.989 - 00:22:00.233] Host: And he is amazing.
[00:22:01.595 - 00:22:04.378] Host: There should be mutual respect.
[00:22:04.398 - 00:22:07.122] Host: There should be mutual love.
[00:22:07.142 - 00:22:10.546] Host: There should be mutual admiration.
[00:22:10.978 - 00:22:15.563] Host: For each other, you should feel, you should encourage each other to do stuff.
[00:22:15.643 - 00:22:17.666] Host: So, they always encourage me.
[00:22:17.726 - 00:22:23.973] Host: He's always, you know, positive about whatever I'm doing, you know.
[00:22:24.113 - 00:22:25.775] Host: So, that always helps.
[00:22:27.277 - 00:22:32.263] Guest: I have done an episode with him too, where I got to know his heart.
[00:22:32.523 - 00:22:34.586] Guest: And he is Madhuri Dixit of his own world.
[00:22:34.606 - 00:22:35.026] Host: Yes.
[00:22:35.298 - 00:22:38.562] Guest: You know, as a surgeon, as an investor, as an entrepreneur.
[00:22:38.763 - 00:22:40.946] Guest: A lot of people only know as a surgeon.
[00:22:41.106 - 00:22:43.529] Guest: They don't even know what he has achieved as a surgeon.
[00:22:43.549 - 00:22:44.871] Guest: I got to know that after the podcast.
[00:22:45.772 - 00:22:49.217] Guest: And I thought that what kind of energy would be there in both your homes?
[00:22:49.237 - 00:22:52.501] Guest: That two electric people are together, growth oriented etc.
[00:22:52.982 - 00:22:55.405] Guest: And in public, both of you are very calm, calm, sweet.
[00:22:56.066 - 00:22:58.670] Guest: But such an intense growth mindset.
[00:22:58.930 - 00:23:01.454] Host: I think it's a great combination of art and science.
[00:23:02.755 - 00:23:03.036] Host: You know.
[00:23:03.717 - 00:23:04.658] Host: And what we...
[00:23:04.770 - 00:23:19.310] Host: intersects people's wellness, you know, health and their, what do you call it, spiritual health.
[00:23:19.330 - 00:23:24.137] Host: You know, all those things, we intersect at that junction.
[00:23:24.557 - 00:23:25.659] Guest: You had an arranged marriage, right?
[00:23:26.219 - 00:23:26.680] Host: Not really.
[00:23:26.700 - 00:23:27.361] Host: It was not really.
[00:23:29.544 - 00:23:31.266] Host: We were introduced by my brother.
[00:23:32.047 - 00:23:32.148] Host: Okay.
[00:23:32.168 - 00:23:33.970] Host: But we dated for six months.
[00:23:34.434 - 00:23:39.919] Host: before we actually decided that yeah, we're right for each other and we should get married.
[00:23:39.939 - 00:23:41.901] Guest: So how did you decide that he will be my husband?
[00:23:41.961 - 00:23:44.664] Host: It's a feeling you get.
[00:23:45.064 - 00:23:45.665] Host: It's a feeling.
[00:23:46.506 - 00:23:47.346] Host: You cannot explain it.
[00:23:47.406 - 00:23:48.287] Host: You can't explain it.
[00:23:48.347 - 00:23:52.892] Host: It's a feeling that comes from inside.
[00:23:53.192 - 00:23:56.395] Host: A gut feeling that this is the right person for me.
[00:23:57.656 - 00:23:59.358] Host: His behavior, the way he was...
[00:24:00.139 - 00:24:03.602] Host: I mean, when he used to talk to me about his patients,
[00:24:03.842 - 00:24:06.266] Host: He used to be so concerned about them all the time.
[00:24:07.809 - 00:24:10.193] Host: He was fighting for two of his patients.
[00:24:10.634 - 00:24:17.586] Host: He was fighting with the authorities that they should get a heart for her or whatever.
[00:24:18.106 - 00:24:21.412] Host: So for his patients, he used to be so concerned for them.
[00:24:21.472 - 00:24:23.155] Host: His bedside manners were amazing.
[00:24:23.736 - 00:24:25.900] Host: He was very caring about everyone.
[00:24:26.481 - 00:24:29.586] Host: He didn't say, my wife is his care.
[00:24:29.858 - 00:24:33.944] Host: He's very caring.
[00:24:33.984 - 00:24:35.466] Host: He's naturally that way.
[00:24:36.267 - 00:24:38.811] Host: And he's very well-read.
[00:24:38.831 - 00:24:40.534] Host: He's very intelligent.
[00:24:41.916 - 00:24:47.945] Host: Like you said, whether it's investments or anything, even photography.
[00:24:48.125 - 00:24:57.619] Host: Like when we shot the song, the one we shot at home during COVID, because I wanted to release one of the songs I had recorded.
[00:24:58.360 - 00:24:59.762] Host: So, Candle.
[00:24:59.874 - 00:25:05.780] Host: because there was no one to picturise, no one was able to come, no one was able to go.
[00:25:05.800 - 00:25:07.281] Host: So he said, okay, I will do the picturise.
[00:25:07.722 - 00:25:09.363] Host: So then he studied everything.
[00:25:09.724 - 00:25:13.948] Host: So now when someone comes home and puts the camera on, he knows everything about the camera.
[00:25:13.988 - 00:25:15.509] Host: He will say, which lens should I put on?
[00:25:15.529 - 00:25:19.353] Host: So even the photographer gets like, oh my God, how does he know so much about it?
[00:25:19.373 - 00:25:21.595] Host: So he is someone who goes into depth, you know.
[00:25:21.956 - 00:25:28.242] Host: If he wants to do anything, he thinks about it in depth and learns everything about it.
[00:25:28.674 - 00:25:31.118] Host: And I loved those qualities in him.
[00:25:31.138 - 00:25:34.803] Host: Is your husband the biggest blessing in your life?
[00:25:34.823 - 00:25:36.526] Host: I think we are a blessing in each other's lives.
[00:25:36.806 - 00:25:37.848] Guest: Both of you?
[00:25:37.868 - 00:25:38.549] Guest: Yes.
[00:25:38.569 - 00:25:39.029] Guest: Absolutely.
[00:25:39.049 - 00:25:40.531] Host: And my kids are the biggest blessings.
[00:25:41.633 - 00:25:43.075] Guest: Bigger than husband?
[00:25:43.095 - 00:25:44.157] Guest: Bigger than anything.
[00:25:44.497 - 00:25:44.898] Host: Really?
[00:25:45.198 - 00:25:45.759] Host: Absolutely.
[00:25:45.939 - 00:25:46.340] Guest: Wow.
[00:25:46.360 - 00:25:47.061] Guest: Okay.
[00:25:47.081 - 00:25:49.364] Guest: So there's a different category for kids.
[00:25:50.045 - 00:25:55.894] Guest: But if I put you in the spot and ask you what's a bigger blessing?
[00:25:56.054 - 00:25:58.578] Guest: Your career success or your husband?
[00:25:59.010 - 00:26:03.276] Host: What do you say?
[00:26:04.457 - 00:26:07.141] Host: See, I had a career.
[00:26:07.161 - 00:26:08.303] Host: And I will have one.
[00:26:09.344 - 00:26:12.148] Host: But I think the bigger blessing is my husband.
[00:26:12.168 - 00:26:13.830] Host: Why?
[00:26:13.850 - 00:26:23.844] Host: Because, you know, if you're not happy in your actual life, if you're not happy in your life, then you can achieve anything.
[00:26:23.864 - 00:26:25.726] Host: You can't get happiness out of it.
[00:26:27.028 - 00:26:28.530] Host: Because you have no one to share it with.
[00:26:30.018 - 00:26:39.110] Host: So, when I am successful, everyone is watching, but I have to share it with someone, my success.
[00:26:39.971 - 00:26:45.618] Host: And when I can share it so beautifully with my husband, I think his importance increases.
[00:26:45.698 - 00:26:49.323] Host: Like, better than the career-wise or whatever.
[00:26:49.804 - 00:26:52.607] Host: Because finally one day people are going to forget you, you know.
[00:26:53.929 - 00:26:57.714] Host: And who's going to be with you, your companion?
[00:26:58.210 - 00:27:00.173] Host: The energy that's going to be with you always.
[00:27:00.914 - 00:27:04.298] Host: So I think that's why he takes a bigger proceed.
[00:27:04.318 - 00:27:06.121] Guest: What is the most important thing in life?
[00:27:08.725 - 00:27:09.786] Host: Oh my God!
[00:27:10.207 - 00:27:12.089] Host: The most important thing in life...
[00:27:14.212 - 00:27:14.753] Host: I think love.
[00:27:16.135 - 00:27:18.418] Host: Love is the most important thing you need in life.
[00:27:18.658 - 00:27:21.743] Guest: This is one of the biggest superstars of the film industry ever saying that.
[00:27:23.185 - 00:27:24.346] Guest: That love is more important.
[00:27:24.767 - 00:27:25.828] Host: Yes, absolutely.
[00:27:25.928 - 00:27:26.129] Guest: Right?
[00:27:26.669 - 00:27:27.090] Host: Absolutely.
[00:27:27.330 - 00:27:31.676] Guest: I think we get to know this with time.
[00:27:31.696 - 00:27:39.148] Guest: I would like to think of a tangent and ask you a very important question.
[00:27:39.268 - 00:27:42.973] Guest: According to my religion, the divine is a woman, is the form of a woman.
[00:27:44.155 - 00:27:53.589] Guest: And ever since this switch has changed in my life, I have noticed that throughout my life, for the last 32 years, there were very strong women in my life.
[00:27:53.629 - 00:27:56.914] Guest: And now there are more strong women coming forward.
[00:27:57.058 - 00:28:00.163] Guest: And I also look at this podcast as a form of that same energy.
[00:28:00.223 - 00:28:00.584] Guest: Genuinely.
[00:28:00.604 - 00:28:03.268] Guest: I was telling the team as well.
[00:28:03.288 - 00:28:03.468] Guest: Okay.
[00:28:03.608 - 00:28:06.974] Guest: So on behalf of strong women, I would like to ask a question.
[00:28:06.994 - 00:28:13.904] Guest: Especially in Indian society, many women have to leave their career for marriage.
[00:28:14.986 - 00:28:17.069] Guest: Before they reach their potential.
[00:28:19.473 - 00:28:22.979] Guest: I think you have reached your potential.
[00:28:22.999 - 00:28:24.060] Guest: Pushed yourself hard.
[00:28:24.361 - 00:28:25.202] Guest: Gave everything.
[00:28:25.986 - 00:28:27.388] Guest: and then you went for marriage.
[00:28:28.610 - 00:28:33.698] Guest: Do you consider this statement to be true or am I saying something wrong?
[00:28:33.718 - 00:28:34.219] Guest: First tell me that.
[00:28:35.020 - 00:28:42.051] Guest: And then generally tell me about this thing that do you ever think of this reality as well for Indian women in general?
[00:28:42.752 - 00:28:43.613] Host: Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:28:43.874 - 00:28:46.999] Host: And I'm not just Indian women, women all over the world.
[00:28:47.459 - 00:28:48.140] Host: All over the world?
[00:28:48.962 - 00:28:51.025] Host: All over the world.
[00:28:51.045 - 00:28:53.469] Host: Because when you get married, you become a family unit.
[00:28:53.809 - 00:28:54.450] Host: It's a unit.
[00:28:54.882 - 00:28:56.204] Host: And you are part of that unit.
[00:28:57.065 - 00:29:00.969] Host: And whatever you do, that unit will always be part of that.
[00:29:02.031 - 00:29:03.833] Host: Do you understand?
[00:29:05.515 - 00:29:17.870] Host: So if your unit, your mother-in-law, father-in-law, husband, daughter, unless you get their support, you can't move forward.
[00:29:17.890 - 00:29:19.112] Host: You can't do anything.
[00:29:19.132 - 00:29:21.094] Host: Their support is very, very important.
[00:29:21.755 - 00:29:24.338] Host: If you want to move forward in life,
[00:29:24.514 - 00:29:33.944] Host: So, I always say that I am also very lucky that when I got married, after that, I got the support of my family.
[00:29:34.004 - 00:29:42.573] Host: Because my mother-in-law herself is educated, she does real estate there and she still works.
[00:29:43.073 - 00:29:44.515] Host: She is 80 plus, she still works.
[00:29:45.596 - 00:29:51.602] Host: My father-in-law also just retired after he turned 83, you know.
[00:29:51.906 - 00:29:54.168] Host: And even after that, he works with FEMA.
[00:29:54.188 - 00:29:58.512] Host: For example, if there is a disaster, he was a civil engineer.
[00:29:58.612 - 00:30:02.576] Host: So, he still does that.
[00:30:03.297 - 00:30:14.227] Host: So, I married into a family where everybody is working and they understand that for a woman to have her identity is also very important.
[00:30:14.748 - 00:30:15.549] Host: They know that.
[00:30:15.569 - 00:30:18.932] Host: They know that they are working on their own.
[00:30:18.952 - 00:30:21.074] Host: They know that they have a house and they can manage it.
[00:30:21.314 - 00:30:28.381] Host: But it is also very important that I am doing something as an individual and I am happy with that.
[00:30:29.202 - 00:30:33.366] Host: And me as an individual, I am doing something for my unit.
[00:30:34.146 - 00:30:39.392] Host: Because you are also contributing to your own unit.
[00:30:39.672 - 00:30:50.162] Host: So when people understand these things and encourage their daughter, daughter-in-law or anyone else,
[00:30:50.370 - 00:30:52.752] Host: go out there and do something with their lives.
[00:30:53.213 - 00:30:54.454] Host: Only then can that thing be made.
[00:30:55.535 - 00:30:57.317] Host: And a lot of times, you don't get that.
[00:30:58.338 - 00:30:58.898] Host: Everybody is...
[00:30:59.419 - 00:31:00.580] Host: Sometimes they are narrow minded.
[00:31:00.660 - 00:31:04.424] Host: They are like, no, a woman can't go out.
[00:31:04.464 - 00:31:05.665] Host: She can't work.
[00:31:05.685 - 00:31:06.666] Host: She can't do this.
[00:31:06.686 - 00:31:08.888] Host: She has to stay at home.
[00:31:08.908 - 00:31:12.151] Host: So when that happens, it's very hard for a woman to step out.
[00:31:13.372 - 00:31:16.135] Guest: You know, there is a subject called Anthropology.
[00:31:16.235 - 00:31:19.218] Guest: That is the study of human society.
[00:31:19.426 - 00:31:24.092] Guest: If you study successful countries, 50% of women are in their workforce.
[00:31:24.953 - 00:31:29.999] Guest: All the women in the country are in their workforce.
[00:31:30.019 - 00:31:33.904] Guest: That's something we can work on as a country as well.
[00:31:34.124 - 00:31:35.105] Guest: I feel going forward.
[00:31:35.245 - 00:31:40.391] Host: Like they say for education, if you educate one woman, you educate a family.
[00:31:41.813 - 00:31:43.255] Host: Because she influences the family.
[00:31:43.275 - 00:31:43.856] Host: She has kids.
[00:31:44.176 - 00:31:44.977] Host: She will teach them.
[00:31:45.017 - 00:31:46.499] Host: She will teach everyone around her.
[00:31:46.959 - 00:31:49.202] Host: Because a woman is very nurturing.
[00:31:49.410 - 00:31:52.313] Host: She's always giving, you know.
[00:31:52.833 - 00:31:57.998] Guest: What advice would you give to guys like me, who are getting married now, and my parents?
[00:31:58.018 - 00:32:05.606] Host: I would say that the girl who is coming into your family is your daughter.
[00:32:06.707 - 00:32:13.293] Host: And I would say that you should encourage her to do something that she loves doing too.
[00:32:14.694 - 00:32:17.477] Host: And if she wants to do something, then you should encourage her.
[00:32:17.497 - 00:32:18.418] Host: You should let her do it.
[00:32:18.850 - 00:32:21.293] Host: Because that is her right.
[00:32:22.494 - 00:32:23.416] Host: That is her right to do.
[00:32:24.917 - 00:32:26.239] Guest: I think this will change in time.
[00:32:26.319 - 00:32:27.521] Guest: We will become more progressive.
[00:32:28.041 - 00:32:29.083] Host: Oh yes, absolutely.
[00:32:29.123 - 00:32:29.944] Host: You can see it now.
[00:32:29.964 - 00:32:31.105] Host: Already I see the change.
[00:32:31.746 - 00:32:32.787] Host: I already see the change.
[00:32:32.847 - 00:32:38.053] Host: Every family has... Like there is a husband and wife, there is always a double income family.
[00:32:38.854 - 00:32:42.058] Guest: When did you get married?
[00:32:42.078 - 00:32:43.180] Guest: In 2000?
[00:32:43.200 - 00:32:43.640] Guest: In 1999.
[00:32:43.941 - 00:32:44.281] Guest: Oh, 1999.
[00:32:44.301 - 00:32:47.946] Guest: Big husband and small husband.
[00:32:47.966 - 00:32:48.306] Guest: Roughly.
[00:32:48.482 - 00:32:54.730] Guest: Let's say when you were shooting for Bade Miya Chote Miya, what was going on in your mind?
[00:32:54.930 - 00:32:56.071] Guest: Not about the film.
[00:32:56.091 - 00:32:59.275] Guest: It's a great film, but not about that film.
[00:32:59.456 - 00:33:02.820] Guest: What was going on in your mind about life?
[00:33:02.840 - 00:33:04.662] Host: I don't think I was thinking about life at that time.
[00:33:04.922 - 00:33:07.345] Host: I was just thinking about how fun this is.
[00:33:07.626 - 00:33:12.632] Host: That Amitji is dancing and Govinda is dancing with them.
[00:33:12.712 - 00:33:14.895] Host: I wasn't thinking about life at that time.
[00:33:15.035 - 00:33:17.618] Host: I was just having fun in that moment.
[00:33:17.954 - 00:33:19.576] Host: This is amazing.
[00:33:19.716 - 00:33:20.417] Host: I love doing this.
[00:33:20.577 - 00:33:23.501] Guest: I want to know about the late 90s and pre-marriage phase.
[00:33:24.001 - 00:33:27.646] Guest: What we just talked about.
[00:33:28.186 - 00:33:30.710] Guest: Were these thoughts in your mind?
[00:33:30.850 - 00:33:32.352] Guest: Post-marriage career?
[00:33:32.912 - 00:33:35.555] Guest: Were you thinking about your whole career?
[00:33:36.036 - 00:33:40.421] Host: When I took this decision that I am going to get married.
[00:33:41.182 - 00:33:47.570] Host: I never thought that if I get married what will happen to my career?
[00:33:48.194 - 00:33:49.816] Host: I was like, I like this guy.
[00:33:50.076 - 00:33:51.858] Host: I love this man.
[00:33:52.759 - 00:33:58.325] Host: And I feel that he is the right life partner for me.
[00:33:58.345 - 00:33:59.246] Host: And I want to marry him.
[00:33:59.867 - 00:34:01.509] Host: I just took the decision and I married him.
[00:34:02.390 - 00:34:04.592] Host: I didn't think about my career.
[00:34:04.612 - 00:34:05.594] Host: Will I get films?
[00:34:05.614 - 00:34:06.995] Host: Will I not?
[00:34:07.015 - 00:34:07.556] Host: What will happen?
[00:34:08.116 - 00:34:09.037] Host: Never thought about that.
[00:34:09.258 - 00:34:10.199] Host: I didn't give it a thought.
[00:34:11.100 - 00:34:13.362] Guest: I would like to give a context to Gen Z.
[00:34:13.683 - 00:34:14.664] Guest: As someone born in 1993.
[00:34:14.704 - 00:34:16.626] Guest: That...
[00:34:17.186 - 00:34:18.928] Guest: I don't think it's the case anymore.
[00:34:19.148 - 00:34:21.430] Guest: Like Shah Rukh Khan says, he's the last of the stars.
[00:34:22.031 - 00:34:23.632] Guest: There's some truth in that statement.
[00:34:23.672 - 00:34:25.594] Guest: Not complete truth, some truth.
[00:34:25.614 - 00:34:30.700] Guest: But there was an absolute queen's throne in the film industry.
[00:34:30.720 - 00:34:34.764] Guest: And your example was used as someone who was on that throne.
[00:34:35.544 - 00:34:43.212] Guest: And I remember even the actors who came after you, everyone was compared to you and what you had reached.
[00:34:44.233 - 00:34:45.234] Guest: So for you,
[00:34:45.986 - 00:34:48.229] Guest: What was the experience of fame?
[00:34:49.231 - 00:34:50.032] Guest: And then you went to USA.
[00:34:50.052 - 00:34:52.496] Guest: Where there was a little bit of a quiet life.
[00:34:52.516 - 00:34:53.758] Guest: Did you like the quiet life?
[00:34:53.998 - 00:34:55.521] Guest: I liked it.
[00:34:56.061 - 00:35:02.812] Host: Like I always say, when I was working here, the fame was...
[00:35:02.832 - 00:35:06.197] Host: When I used to go home, I used to leave everything outside the door.
[00:35:07.279 - 00:35:10.023] Host: At home, I was a daughter, I was a sister.
[00:35:10.924 - 00:35:12.967] Host: I was like anybody else.
[00:35:13.368 - 00:35:14.770] Host: I was just me.
[00:35:15.778 - 00:35:21.246] Host: And because of that, when I got married and went there, it was quiet and everything.
[00:35:21.267 - 00:35:23.470] Host: I didn't even...
[00:35:23.490 - 00:35:26.274] Host: I didn't even think that it was so quiet here.
[00:35:26.334 - 00:35:27.096] Host: You know, like that.
[00:35:27.777 - 00:35:29.359] Host: It was like living a dream for me.
[00:35:30.280 - 00:35:31.723] Host: Because I come from a big family.
[00:35:31.743 - 00:35:32.724] Host: I have four siblings.
[00:35:33.566 - 00:35:36.310] Host: And I always loved children.
[00:35:36.730 - 00:35:41.618] Host: And for me, dreaming of my life, I was very...
[00:35:42.370 - 00:35:47.597] Host: romantic in that sense that I wanted a house and a husband and kids and you know all that.
[00:35:47.637 - 00:35:49.599] Host: That was a big part of my dream.
[00:35:50.100 - 00:35:52.583] Host: So when I went there, I was living my dream.
[00:35:52.943 - 00:35:56.147] Host: I was not missing anything in my life.
[00:35:57.048 - 00:35:58.450] Host: Yes, sometimes I used to miss my art.
[00:35:59.171 - 00:36:03.577] Host: Because whether it was dance or acting, I used to miss art sometimes.
[00:36:04.277 - 00:36:06.160] Host: But I was living a dream.
[00:36:06.240 - 00:36:09.163] Host: I thoroughly enjoyed my time with my kids.
[00:36:09.844 - 00:36:11.186] Host: Unhindered time.
[00:36:11.362 - 00:36:15.408] Host: No one is bothering me or commenting or anything like that.
[00:36:15.428 - 00:36:23.920] Host: In my whole privacy, I was having my lovely, lovely dream coming true right in front of me.
[00:36:24.360 - 00:36:33.573] Guest: There is a quote in which I believe a lot that the most valuable things in life are earned.
[00:36:34.674 - 00:36:39.041] Guest: A fit body, a calm mind and a house full of love.
[00:36:39.581 - 00:36:40.082] Guest: Health
[00:36:41.346 - 00:36:45.111] Guest: peace of mind and a loving home.
[00:36:45.131 - 00:36:46.153] Guest: This is also called Naval Ravi Khan.
[00:36:46.874 - 00:36:49.277] Guest: And I think these are the three most important things in life.
[00:36:49.838 - 00:36:51.560] Guest: But please, agree or disagree.
[00:36:51.620 - 00:36:52.381] Host: No, I agree with you.
[00:36:52.742 - 00:36:54.284] Host: I agree with you.
[00:36:55.225 - 00:37:01.394] Host: Because see, when you are fit in your body, you are strong to take on life's challenges.
[00:37:01.594 - 00:37:02.616] Host: You fit in your mind.
[00:37:02.676 - 00:37:08.243] Host: Again, you are strong to take on the challenges that life gives out to you.
[00:37:09.726 - 00:37:10.066] Host: Which your
[00:37:10.594 - 00:37:17.542] Host: Whatever happens in life, whatever challenges you, you can do it strongly.
[00:37:17.642 - 00:37:21.527] Host: And of course, if there is love around you, what else do you want?
[00:37:21.867 - 00:37:25.151] Host: So these three things are the most important thing for me.
[00:37:25.211 - 00:37:27.815] Guest: But it takes a lot of effort for these three.
[00:37:27.975 - 00:37:29.817] Guest: It takes a lot of effort for these three.
[00:37:29.837 - 00:37:31.739] Host: What does it take for a house full of love?
[00:37:31.759 - 00:37:33.041] Host: To keep the house full of love.
[00:37:33.782 - 00:37:37.426] Host: Because saying that, oh, it's loving and all that,
[00:37:37.794 - 00:37:43.143] Host: But for that also you have to sometimes make sacrifices to keep it, to keep that love going.
[00:37:43.603 - 00:37:51.496] Host: If you take someone's loss on everything and say that it didn't happen, then it can't happen.
[00:37:51.516 - 00:37:53.720] Host: It will always be a challenge, you know.
[00:37:56.004 - 00:38:01.693] Host: But you have to be a little giving to create that love and everything, you know.
[00:38:02.414 - 00:38:04.818] Guest: Ma'am, you are so loving.
[00:38:05.154 - 00:38:09.519] Guest: It's very weird to see you as Mrs. Deshpande and it's also something we applaud.
[00:38:10.219 - 00:38:11.060] Guest: But it's strange.
[00:38:13.403 - 00:38:13.783] Guest: Yeah.
[00:38:14.304 - 00:38:15.826] Guest: But I guess that's the skill of an actor.
[00:38:16.686 - 00:38:21.291] Host: Yeah, I mean as an actor, you should be able to play any part, I feel.
[00:38:21.932 - 00:38:26.917] Host: And the more challenging part is, the more beyond your image, the better.
[00:38:27.838 - 00:38:31.282] Host: Because then that's one step ahead, like I said.
[00:38:32.343 - 00:38:34.866] Host: Now people will like it or not, I don't know.
[00:38:35.522 - 00:38:37.625] Host: But I think I have put my best work.
[00:38:38.786 - 00:38:43.713] Host: And the character that was there, we have put it on the screen.
[00:38:44.834 - 00:38:48.399] Host: And rest is up to the people now to like it or not like it.
[00:38:48.419 - 00:38:50.782] Guest: Where do you channel this darkness from?
[00:38:51.023 - 00:38:53.847] Guest: From the observations of life?
[00:38:53.867 - 00:38:55.088] Guest: Yes, absolutely.
[00:38:55.148 - 00:38:56.891] Guest: Like you don't have to go through the darkness yourself.
[00:38:57.191 - 00:38:59.394] Host: No, you don't have to go through anything yourself.
[00:38:59.454 - 00:39:00.976] Host: That's why we call it acting.
[00:39:01.216 - 00:39:04.160] Host: Like someone said, what happened?
[00:39:04.501 - 00:39:05.362] Host: What incident was it?
[00:39:06.114 - 00:39:09.597] Host: So they said, try acting.
[00:39:10.378 - 00:39:12.260] Host: That's what you're supposed to do.
[00:39:12.280 - 00:39:15.543] Host: But it comes from your heart.
[00:39:15.563 - 00:39:24.452] Host: Because you've observed, you meet people, you listen to stories, you read stories, you watch real life stories.
[00:39:24.532 - 00:39:28.276] Host: And with all this, you're always absorbing.
[00:39:28.836 - 00:39:34.482] Host: You're always absorbing, you're always learning, you're always...
[00:39:34.626 - 00:39:35.848] Host: They are like a sponge.
[00:39:35.868 - 00:39:36.108] Host: You know?
[00:39:36.829 - 00:39:38.191] Host: You always absorb them.
[00:39:38.231 - 00:39:42.276] Host: And those things that you have learned from your life, you have seen so many things.
[00:39:42.296 - 00:39:47.724] Host: When you do such a role, you use all that to get into the role.
[00:39:48.084 - 00:39:50.788] Host: You know, all your observations you keep in your head.
[00:39:51.309 - 00:39:53.371] Host: And then you kind of create that character.
[00:39:54.453 - 00:39:56.416] Host: And of course, the director is always there to help you.
[00:39:57.417 - 00:40:00.601] Host: The directors also have some ideas about the character.
[00:40:00.621 - 00:40:04.146] Host: So these two things have to merge.
[00:40:04.578 - 00:40:11.088] Host: And then you can create that character in the movie or series.
[00:40:11.108 - 00:40:14.953] Guest: I can't ever imagine you unstable in any capacity.
[00:40:15.714 - 00:40:20.982] Guest: I mean, with this interaction, your stability will stay with me.
[00:40:21.002 - 00:40:21.583] Guest: In the long term.
[00:40:22.204 - 00:40:22.865] Guest: Yes, absolutely.
[00:40:23.105 - 00:40:24.267] Guest: Is this an outcome of time?
[00:40:24.287 - 00:40:27.432] Guest: Or a saying?
[00:40:27.452 - 00:40:28.253] Guest: Or what is happening?
[00:40:28.333 - 00:40:30.176] Guest: And do you ever get... Everything.
[00:40:30.316 - 00:40:34.322] Host: Even when I used to dance, I think it's a very spiritual thing for me.
[00:40:34.882 - 00:40:39.206] Host: So for my mind, body and soul, it was a very balancing thing for me.
[00:40:39.326 - 00:40:41.969] Host: Are you talking about dance or Kathak?
[00:40:43.070 - 00:40:43.891] Host: Dance in general.
[00:40:44.431 - 00:40:45.272] Host: Not only Kathak.
[00:40:46.013 - 00:40:46.453] Host: All dance.
[00:40:47.514 - 00:40:52.138] Host: And in Kathak, of course, there are so many different aspects.
[00:40:52.159 - 00:40:54.361] Host: We do bhajans.
[00:40:54.381 - 00:40:59.285] Host: We do shlokas.
[00:40:59.305 - 00:41:00.326] Host: We dance on them.
[00:41:01.087 - 00:41:02.468] Host: There is a pause in dance.
[00:41:02.488 - 00:41:04.210] Host: There is a delay.
[00:41:04.354 - 00:41:08.838] Host: be it fast, slow or slow.
[00:41:09.839 - 00:41:11.741] Host: So, you're playing with all that.
[00:41:11.781 - 00:41:14.043] Host: You're playing with all those elements when you're dancing.
[00:41:14.604 - 00:41:17.987] Guest: Would you say that Dola Re Dola is one of your best ever dance performances?
[00:41:18.928 - 00:41:24.273] Host: I think Dola Re Dola is one of the best songs shot, period.
[00:41:24.293 - 00:41:24.393] Unknown: Okay.
[00:41:24.413 - 00:41:26.536] Guest: But for example, something iconic like that.
[00:41:27.136 - 00:41:28.858] Guest: What was going on in your mind?
[00:41:29.959 - 00:41:30.960] Guest: When we're shooting for it.
[00:41:31.100 - 00:41:33.202] Guest: When you're dancing at that level.
[00:41:33.762 - 00:41:35.205] Host: Yes, this is what is going on.
[00:41:35.226 - 00:41:36.468] Host: Your race is always towards perfection.
[00:41:36.849 - 00:41:46.172] Host: So whether I did it or not, whether I was perfect or not, whether I came out on time or not.
[00:41:46.252 - 00:41:49.600] Host: Apart from that, you are not thinking about the song.
[00:41:50.101 - 00:41:52.146] Host: What are its words, what is its meaning.
[00:41:52.642 - 00:41:56.427] Host: or the timing between the two characters, me and Ash.
[00:41:56.507 - 00:41:57.909] Host: When do we have to go out?
[00:41:57.929 - 00:41:59.771] Host: When will the trolley move?
[00:41:59.811 - 00:42:01.994] Host: When do we have to come in?
[00:42:02.014 - 00:42:02.895] Host: When do we have to sit and move?
[00:42:02.915 - 00:42:04.818] Host: So, you're just thinking of all that.
[00:42:05.319 - 00:42:06.901] Host: For that, you have to be present.
[00:42:06.921 - 00:42:09.865] Host: You have to be there, in the present.
[00:42:13.049 - 00:42:14.711] Host: You cannot, your mind cannot waver.
[00:42:15.051 - 00:42:17.074] Guest: But its preparation started from age 3.
[00:42:18.178 - 00:42:22.584] Guest: Years of doing that, getting a body, mind, expression.
[00:42:24.066 - 00:42:27.611] Guest: I feel that you as a soul were born to be Madhuri Dixit.
[00:42:27.631 - 00:42:31.677] Guest: Now that I am getting to know more of you.
[00:42:31.817 - 00:42:37.024] Guest: I would like to ask you that according to you, what are your top three career highlights?
[00:42:37.545 - 00:42:39.047] Host: Top three career highlights?
[00:42:39.588 - 00:42:41.430] Host: I would say that first is Tezab.
[00:42:41.651 - 00:42:45.676] Host: No, first is Abodh because that got me into films.
[00:42:45.776 - 00:42:47.058] Host: The second will be Tezab.
[00:42:47.970 - 00:42:53.998] Host: And third will be, I think, receiving the Padma Shri.
[00:42:54.840 - 00:43:01.028] Host: Because that validates not only you, your art, but the way you've led your life.
[00:43:03.492 - 00:43:05.935] Host: The whole essence of life.
[00:43:05.955 - 00:43:09.881] Host: The award you get for that.
[00:43:10.822 - 00:43:14.267] Host: And more than anything else, I would say, the love of my fans.
[00:43:14.908 - 00:43:16.530] Host: Which has never wavered.
[00:43:16.898 - 00:43:21.244] Host: My ups and downs have always supported me.
[00:43:21.264 - 00:43:23.107] Host: I think that is the craziest thing.
[00:43:23.327 - 00:43:26.852] Guest: What is the craziest thing that a fan has done for you?
[00:43:26.872 - 00:43:29.135] Host: First of all, they used to write letters with blood.
[00:43:29.155 - 00:43:29.516] Host: With blood.
[00:43:29.536 - 00:43:31.218] Host: They used to write such letters.
[00:43:31.238 - 00:43:33.882] Host: What did you think when you saw the letters of blood?
[00:43:34.403 - 00:43:35.644] Host: Oh, it was just frightening.
[00:43:36.165 - 00:43:40.952] Host: It was scary because someone goes so far.
[00:43:41.833 - 00:43:42.394] Host: It's scary.
[00:43:44.897 - 00:43:45.458] Host: Either...
[00:43:45.794 - 00:43:51.199] Host: Like beautiful things, like... Once we were shooting in Lucknow.
[00:43:51.700 - 00:43:53.682] Host: A man came there.
[00:43:53.702 - 00:43:55.744] Host: He said, I'm a big fan of yours, ma'am.
[00:43:55.764 - 00:43:56.965] Host: You don't know me.
[00:43:56.985 - 00:43:59.447] Host: I said, okay, you must be.
[00:43:59.468 - 00:44:01.089] Host: He said, you'll have to see me.
[00:44:01.109 - 00:44:02.991] Host: He took off his hat.
[00:44:03.011 - 00:44:05.554] Host: He had Madhuri in his hair.
[00:44:06.494 - 00:44:08.797] Host: Like you could see the name written in his hair.
[00:44:08.817 - 00:44:11.439] Host: He should have done this today.
[00:44:11.459 - 00:44:12.300] Guest: He changed his bouquet.
[00:44:12.781 - 00:44:14.162] Guest: Anyway, go on.
[00:44:15.298 - 00:44:17.080] Host: So a lot of different ways.
[00:44:17.441 - 00:44:21.387] Host: There is a man in North India, who is Sardarji.
[00:44:21.407 - 00:44:25.052] Host: He does so much social work there.
[00:44:25.452 - 00:44:27.155] Host: He does so much social work there.
[00:44:28.276 - 00:44:29.197] Host: Which is amazing.
[00:44:30.539 - 00:44:35.526] Host: And he celebrates my birthday every year.
[00:44:35.546 - 00:44:37.790] Host: It's amazing the kind of work he does.
[00:44:38.511 - 00:44:39.912] Host: And I get his blessings.
[00:44:40.553 - 00:44:41.875] Host: Because he is doing it in my name.
[00:44:42.336 - 00:44:43.858] Host: It's amazing what people do.
[00:44:44.066 - 00:44:48.192] Guest: We're talking about career success, fan, love, etc.
[00:44:48.432 - 00:44:53.859] Guest: I want to zoom out and talk about career success, fan, love, etc.
[00:44:53.880 - 00:44:54.741] Guest: from a 2025 lens.
[00:44:55.422 - 00:44:57.825] Guest: Let's, for example, take the film industry.
[00:44:57.985 - 00:45:00.809] Guest: All my film industry friends have seen a lot of success.
[00:45:01.150 - 00:45:02.171] Guest: And this is not just the film industry.
[00:45:02.191 - 00:45:03.493] Guest: This is all of media.
[00:45:03.893 - 00:45:07.659] Guest: Everyone thinks that they've gotten less than what they deserve.
[00:45:07.719 - 00:45:10.703] Guest: Everyone thinks that someone else is doing more.
[00:45:10.803 - 00:45:13.106] Guest: Everyone thinks that they've not reached their potential.
[00:45:13.634 - 00:45:18.682] Guest: And then when I meet legends like you, you all say that fate has a big role.
[00:45:18.702 - 00:45:21.226] Guest: That virtue has a big role.
[00:45:21.246 - 00:45:22.669] Guest: There's too many things out of your control.
[00:45:23.390 - 00:45:27.737] Guest: So as a podcast host, I have the luxury of being exposed to these perspectives.
[00:45:28.057 - 00:45:28.538] Guest: Right.
[00:45:28.558 - 00:45:30.121] Guest: So I feel that I'm quite stable.
[00:45:31.082 - 00:45:36.551] Guest: But is it right to just work hard and keep moving forward and then wait for destiny to happen?
[00:45:37.533 - 00:45:38.254] Guest: Or what should I do?
[00:45:38.274 - 00:45:40.818] Host: If you're working hard, you're not waiting for destiny to happen.
[00:45:40.994 - 00:45:52.725] Host: If you're sitting at home and not doing anything, saying that I should get something that can do this and that, then that is wrong.
[00:45:52.885 - 00:45:55.988] Host: You'll have to do hard work.
[00:45:56.189 - 00:45:57.730] Host: You'll have to put yourself out there.
[00:45:58.271 - 00:45:59.652] Host: You know, put yourself in the grind.
[00:46:00.192 - 00:46:02.254] Host: Nose to the grind and just keep working.
[00:46:03.015 - 00:46:07.119] Host: You'll get chances, you'll get opportunities.
[00:46:07.299 - 00:46:10.322] Guest: Let's say, whoever I'm talking about,
[00:46:10.562 - 00:46:12.505] Guest: They are working very hard.
[00:46:12.525 - 00:46:15.729] Guest: They are peaking out on how much hard work they can give in the world.
[00:46:15.749 - 00:46:17.211] Guest: I am talking about them.
[00:46:17.231 - 00:46:19.475] Host: Okay, and still they don't get success.
[00:46:19.855 - 00:46:21.037] Guest: And again, we are not...
[00:46:21.457 - 00:46:28.327] Host: I mean, luck is something, you know, and then when something like that happens, then you talk about luck.
[00:46:28.547 - 00:46:34.676] Host: You know, that you have done everything, you have worked hard, but you are not getting success.
[00:46:34.696 - 00:46:38.141] Host: So, somewhere, there is another issue.
[00:46:38.161 - 00:46:38.802] Host: So,
[00:46:39.010 - 00:46:40.411] Host: You put it in your destiny.
[00:46:40.431 - 00:46:42.434] Guest: Have you ever read your own astrology chart?
[00:46:42.594 - 00:46:43.214] Guest: No.
[00:46:43.515 - 00:46:44.075] Guest: Consciously?
[00:46:45.557 - 00:46:45.677] Host: No.
[00:46:45.697 - 00:46:47.919] Host: I have never believed in it.
[00:46:48.340 - 00:46:51.723] Host: But I have had an experience with someone who was a face reader.
[00:46:52.624 - 00:46:53.806] Host: I was a kid.
[00:46:54.466 - 00:46:55.367] Host: It was not my choice.
[00:46:55.748 - 00:46:56.468] Host: I was a kid.
[00:46:56.508 - 00:47:02.214] Host: That's when my mother called him.
[00:47:02.835 - 00:47:05.618] Host: Because he had come to someone's house.
[00:47:05.858 - 00:47:08.041] Host: So he read my face and said, what are you doing?
[00:47:08.061 - 00:47:09.222] Host: I said, I want to do science.
[00:47:09.242 - 00:47:10.384] Host: I want to become a science student.
[00:47:10.404 - 00:47:19.376] Host: So he said, no, no, you have to go into arts because you will have a lot of fame in arts.
[00:47:19.396 - 00:47:22.480] Host: I mean, you can become a big star.
[00:47:22.700 - 00:47:25.103] Host: That's what he said.
[00:47:25.164 - 00:47:26.706] Host: But we just took it with a pinch of salt.
[00:47:28.148 - 00:47:30.611] Host: And we never really thought about it ever again.
[00:47:30.811 - 00:47:33.074] Guest: When did you start thinking about it again?
[00:47:33.154 - 00:47:37.460] Host: When Teza Bhai became a star, I started thinking about him.
[00:47:37.480 - 00:47:38.301] Host: Yes, he came.
[00:47:38.321 - 00:47:39.923] Host: Do you remember the priest?
[00:47:39.943 - 00:47:42.367] Guest: Did you meet the priest after that?
[00:47:42.407 - 00:47:42.827] Host: No.
[00:47:42.887 - 00:47:43.849] Host: I didn't know where he came from.
[00:47:44.129 - 00:47:45.291] Guest: Was it even a real person?
[00:47:47.253 - 00:47:47.994] Host: No, it wasn't.
[00:47:48.455 - 00:47:53.602] Host: A lot of people had seen him.
[00:47:53.682 - 00:47:55.785] Host: A lot of people had seen him.
[00:47:55.885 - 00:47:58.448] Host: So, I know that it was a real person.
[00:47:58.669 - 00:47:59.330] Guest: Okay.
[00:47:59.350 - 00:48:02.514] Guest: Did you have any such weird experiences in life?
[00:48:02.626 - 00:48:25.446] Host: Like I feel dreams have a lot of, you know, importance in your life because there's a lot of things you process in your dreams and sometimes I have dreamt of something and I woke up and the first topic that came up in the house was about that which I had dreamt of, you know.
[00:48:25.947 - 00:48:27.730] Host: So I had dreamt of something like
[00:48:27.906 - 00:48:32.390] Host: There was a snake bite and we were trying to find something to cure it.
[00:48:32.410 - 00:48:37.395] Host: I had a dream and when I woke up, my brother had sent me on WhatsApp.
[00:48:37.415 - 00:48:43.841] Host: When I woke up, I saw that with camel tears, they are creating something for snake bites.
[00:48:43.861 - 00:48:47.905] Host: That was the first thing I saw on my phone when I woke up.
[00:48:47.925 - 00:48:49.267] Host: So, things like that.
[00:48:49.327 - 00:48:52.510] Host: I mean, I think it might be coincidence or whatever.
[00:48:53.171 - 00:48:56.754] Host: But they say that when you sleep,
[00:48:56.962 - 00:49:06.295] Host: There are lot of things your mind kind of... Solves in your own way, weird dreams, whatever.
[00:49:06.315 - 00:49:09.179] Host: About life and your own chemistry.
[00:49:09.760 - 00:49:12.364] Guest: I have explored the subject of dreams a lot through the show.
[00:49:12.384 - 00:49:16.189] Guest: I talked to a neuroscientist and he said that you have Bhurji in your mind all day long.
[00:49:16.209 - 00:49:20.175] Guest: That Bhurji gets processed and a Saar comes out.
[00:49:20.295 - 00:49:25.042] Guest: So actually this conscious mind is giving you an answer by taking out Bhurji from your subconscious.
[00:49:25.122 - 00:49:28.145] Guest: But many spiritualists have also talked about it.
[00:49:28.165 - 00:49:30.668] Guest: They said that it is true that it is a Bhurji process.
[00:49:31.208 - 00:49:44.523] Guest: But to an extent, when you see some divine entity in a dream or you see animals, often they have a spiritual meaning in dreams or you are given a blessing.
[00:49:44.603 - 00:49:51.410] Guest: And I feel that people like you who have got so much fame, so much love, even in personal life,
[00:49:51.586 - 00:49:53.769] Guest: Obviously, there are a lot of blessings around you.
[00:49:54.029 - 00:50:00.378] Guest: So I won't be surprised if angels really come to you in your dreams, in your childhood and bless you.
[00:50:01.079 - 00:50:01.399] Guest: I feel.
[00:50:02.180 - 00:50:04.543] Host: I don't know.
[00:50:04.563 - 00:50:05.685] Host: I think that's too deep.
[00:50:08.228 - 00:50:08.929] Host: I really don't know.
[00:50:09.049 - 00:50:09.570] Host: I don't know.
[00:50:09.590 - 00:50:10.391] Host: I think I am blessed.
[00:50:11.012 - 00:50:16.820] Host: And everyday I feel gratitude that I am blessed.
[00:50:17.280 - 00:50:18.642] Host: There is someone watching over me.
[00:50:19.010 - 00:50:21.693] Host: I feel that there is a power above you.
[00:50:22.673 - 00:50:24.115] Host: I don't know what Roop it has.
[00:50:24.835 - 00:50:27.538] Host: But it's something there and I...
[00:50:28.319 - 00:50:30.461] Host: I'm always grateful for that power.
[00:50:30.481 - 00:50:35.786] Guest: You know ma'am, nowadays there are many things like manifestation, law of attraction on algorithms.
[00:50:36.466 - 00:50:42.792] Guest: But as far as I have understood these things, I have to say that your outer world is a reflection of your inner world.
[00:50:42.812 - 00:50:48.978] Guest: If you are sorted from the inside, full of love, happy, positive, all those things start happening.
[00:50:49.186 - 00:50:50.969] Guest: And you are a great example of exactly that.
[00:50:51.750 - 00:50:56.678] Guest: I am sure even before your success, you were very positive from inside.
[00:50:56.698 - 00:50:58.741] Host: Yeah, I was very positive but I was a very shy person.
[00:50:59.583 - 00:51:01.085] Host: And I still am to a certain extent.
[00:51:01.405 - 00:51:01.586] Host: Really?
[00:51:02.728 - 00:51:04.230] Host: Yeah.
[00:51:04.250 - 00:51:05.272] Host: I am not very outgoing.
[00:51:05.312 - 00:51:08.717] Host: I am not like, whenever we meet, we talk about life.
[00:51:08.797 - 00:51:10.079] Host: I am very guarded.
[00:51:10.179 - 00:51:13.364] Host: Maybe because of who I am and the profession I am in.
[00:51:13.385 - 00:51:14.126] Host: You are introverted.
[00:51:14.787 - 00:51:16.850] Host: I used to be very in school.
[00:51:17.186 - 00:51:18.868] Host: But I don't know what happened on stage.
[00:51:19.028 - 00:51:21.671] Host: I was like the most comfortable on stage.
[00:51:23.393 - 00:51:25.196] Host: But in life, I used to be very quiet.
[00:51:25.936 - 00:51:26.978] Host: I was a very quiet child.
[00:51:27.518 - 00:51:32.104] Host: But as soon as I used to become a lion on stage, I used to own the stage, literally.
[00:51:33.946 - 00:51:37.570] Host: But yeah, I think positivity is there.
[00:51:37.590 - 00:51:38.591] Host: I believe a lot in it.
[00:51:39.352 - 00:51:42.216] Host: Because people say, why is your smile so good?
[00:51:42.376 - 00:51:43.237] Host: Why is it like this?
[00:51:43.257 - 00:51:44.178] Host: Why is it like that?
[00:51:44.514 - 00:51:47.717] Host: I say that because whenever I smile at someone, I really mean it.
[00:51:48.678 - 00:51:50.520] Host: I really like meeting you.
[00:51:51.381 - 00:51:52.222] Host: That's why I smiled.
[00:51:52.622 - 00:51:53.563] Host: I like meeting him.
[00:51:53.843 - 00:51:55.905] Host: When I walked in, he was standing at the door.
[00:51:55.925 - 00:51:57.587] Host: I said, hello, how are you?
[00:51:58.227 - 00:51:59.148] Host: Because I like him.
[00:51:59.168 - 00:52:00.229] Host: I like people.
[00:52:00.289 - 00:52:00.730] Host: I like him.
[00:52:00.890 - 00:52:07.116] Host: So when your smile reaches the eyes from the heart, then it looks real.
[00:52:07.877 - 00:52:08.858] Host: Because you really mean it.
[00:52:09.499 - 00:52:11.901] Host: So positivity is very important in life.
[00:52:12.301 - 00:52:13.042] Guest: And camera...
[00:52:13.122 - 00:52:18.530] Guest: I feel that.
[00:52:18.650 - 00:52:19.331] Guest: I don't know.
[00:52:20.172 - 00:52:23.236] Host: I don't know if I agree with that or not.
[00:52:23.276 - 00:52:25.179] Guest: Wow.
[00:52:25.479 - 00:52:26.521] Guest: That's experience speaking.
[00:52:27.422 - 00:52:34.051] Host: It's not like you have to be a good person to be a good actor.
[00:52:34.111 - 00:52:34.732] Host: It's not like that.
[00:52:34.792 - 00:52:35.754] Host: You can be a good actor.
[00:52:35.954 - 00:52:37.676] Host: You're an actor.
[00:52:39.259 - 00:52:41.682] Guest: But I feel that the top 1%
[00:52:42.754 - 00:52:44.316] Guest: Their performances have magic.
[00:52:44.336 - 00:52:47.120] Guest: I can think of you and Shah Rukh Khan in that category.
[00:52:47.660 - 00:52:48.381] Guest: That's what I want.
[00:52:48.401 - 00:52:51.205] Guest: I feel that you guys are actually on the inside also, full on.
[00:52:51.245 - 00:52:52.386] Host: Shah Rukh is fabulous.
[00:52:52.406 - 00:52:53.548] Host: He's such a nice person.
[00:52:53.668 - 00:52:54.909] Host: I've worked with him in so many films.
[00:52:56.672 - 00:52:57.413] Host: Charisma.
[00:52:58.514 - 00:52:59.876] Host: That charm.
[00:53:00.396 - 00:53:01.758] Host: And very down to earth.
[00:53:01.798 - 00:53:05.223] Host: Very protective about the women, you know.
[00:53:05.603 - 00:53:08.347] Host: Whenever we used to shoot, he used to make sure you're sitting in the car.
[00:53:08.387 - 00:53:09.628] Host: Okay, you're going home.
[00:53:10.329 - 00:53:11.090] Host: You know, all that.
[00:53:11.554 - 00:53:13.256] Host: Very charming, very nice person.
[00:53:13.276 - 00:53:14.538] Host: Absolutely.
[00:53:14.558 - 00:53:17.842] Guest: What memories do you have of Dil Toh Pagale?
[00:53:17.862 - 00:53:19.824] Host: Dil Toh Pagale has a lot of good memories.
[00:53:19.884 - 00:53:23.769] Host: I was working with Yash G for the first time in Dil Toh Pagale.
[00:53:23.789 - 00:53:27.053] Host: I met him many times before that.
[00:53:27.073 - 00:53:29.696] Host: But we had never worked together.
[00:53:29.716 - 00:53:30.497] Host: It was the first time.
[00:53:30.537 - 00:53:36.063] Host: His way of giving instructions was different.
[00:53:36.164 - 00:53:37.645] Host: He used to walk off.
[00:53:38.186 - 00:53:40.188] Host: I didn't understand what he was saying.
[00:53:40.208 - 00:53:41.490] Host: What were his instructions?
[00:53:41.698 - 00:53:43.380] Host: He's like, nothing, just enjoy yourself.
[00:53:43.761 - 00:53:47.365] Host: He said that he may just be free and nice.
[00:53:47.385 - 00:53:49.488] Host: He used to tell me.
[00:53:49.508 - 00:53:50.108] Host: Oh, okay, okay.
[00:53:50.128 - 00:53:51.550] Host: Then we used to do the scene and everything.
[00:53:52.191 - 00:54:00.080] Host: So when I did Gajgamini with Hussain Ji, I got a chance to return that favor to him.
[00:54:00.121 - 00:54:01.803] Host: Because Hussain Ji was also like that.
[00:54:01.823 - 00:54:03.344] Host: He used to talk in the short hand.
[00:54:03.445 - 00:54:06.689] Host: He used to come with the camera and go like this.
[00:54:06.709 - 00:54:07.890] Host: I was like, what?
[00:54:08.002 - 00:54:08.643] Host: What did he say?
[00:54:08.663 - 00:54:09.605] Host: I said, nothing.
[00:54:09.645 - 00:54:10.406] Host: Just have fun.
[00:54:11.608 - 00:54:14.973] Host: Pick up your camera and say something with a smile.
[00:54:15.073 - 00:54:15.554] Host: That's it.
[00:54:15.574 - 00:54:16.395] Host: That's all he wants.
[00:54:16.896 - 00:54:19.540] Host: So, we had so much fun on that movie.
[00:54:19.580 - 00:54:21.123] Host: It was so nice.
[00:54:22.826 - 00:54:24.789] Host: All the scenes, you know, everything.
[00:54:25.069 - 00:54:25.770] Host: It was amazing.
[00:54:26.371 - 00:54:30.578] Guest: If someone wants to know about love in visual motion, then their heart is crazy.
[00:54:31.010 - 00:54:31.871] Guest: That's what I get.
[00:54:32.031 - 00:54:35.295] Guest: And even the three leads, everyone acted great.
[00:54:35.315 - 00:54:35.856] Guest: Amazing.
[00:54:35.936 - 00:54:36.296] Guest: Magical.
[00:54:36.457 - 00:54:37.358] Host: Everything.
[00:54:37.478 - 00:54:38.038] Guest: Jadui.
[00:54:38.399 - 00:54:38.559] Host: All.
[00:54:40.201 - 00:54:41.723] Host: Everything about that movie people loved.
[00:54:41.923 - 00:54:45.147] Guest: I don't know if you have seen Yash Chopra's documentary.
[00:54:46.188 - 00:54:48.050] Guest: But it's a very good documentary.
[00:54:48.972 - 00:54:52.476] Guest: And a lot has been said about his art.
[00:54:53.697 - 00:54:57.682] Guest: I feel that again for Gen Z, Gen Z's are discovering this older cinema at this point.
[00:54:57.890 - 00:55:01.835] Guest: I think we should see all of Ash Chopra's filmography which he directed himself.
[00:55:01.855 - 00:55:13.329] Host: And you know the fantastic thing about him is, in every film of his, even if the men are leading, but women always had important roles in his movie.
[00:55:13.349 - 00:55:14.871] Host: The way he presented the women.
[00:55:15.812 - 00:55:17.855] Host: Amazing, elegant, you know.
[00:55:20.038 - 00:55:22.541] Host: Very romantic maybe.
[00:55:23.362 - 00:55:26.706] Host: Elegance, charm, grace and power.
[00:55:27.330 - 00:55:30.315] Host: His women always were empowered in the movies.
[00:55:30.876 - 00:55:34.221] Guest: Because he valued his wife and mom and he had a sister.
[00:55:34.241 - 00:55:34.882] Host: Absolutely.
[00:55:34.902 - 00:55:36.605] Host: He had that...
[00:55:36.625 - 00:55:38.869] Host: The way he looked at women was that way.
[00:55:39.810 - 00:55:40.812] Guest: Same thing with Shah Rukh Khan.
[00:55:40.972 - 00:55:41.914] Guest: Same thing with Yash Chowk.
[00:55:41.934 - 00:55:45.740] Guest: And it's a very important man's lesson while growing up.
[00:55:45.940 - 00:55:47.623] Guest: And you take time to learn it.
[00:55:47.643 - 00:55:51.149] Guest: But when that happens, there's a switch that happens in your life.
[00:55:51.169 - 00:55:54.514] Guest: The sad thing is many men get through life without learning that lesson.
[00:55:55.426 - 00:55:57.828] Guest: And they also don't get to experience the luxuries of life.
[00:55:58.709 - 00:55:59.770] Guest: Have you heard of Venus energy?
[00:56:01.272 - 00:56:02.513] Guest: No, I haven't heard of it.
[00:56:02.533 - 00:56:15.346] Guest: Basically, if you treat your partner, mom, sister, all the women in your life like royalty and then extend that to all women everywhere, Venus energy visits your life more.
[00:56:15.666 - 00:56:17.208] Guest: You shouldn't do it for Venus energy.
[00:56:17.228 - 00:56:18.629] Guest: Venus energy means luxuries etc.
[00:56:19.410 - 00:56:20.791] Host: You know, I'm a Taurean.
[00:56:21.412 - 00:56:22.252] Host: I'm ruled by Venus.
[00:56:22.593 - 00:56:23.794] Guest: Okay.
[00:56:24.194 - 00:56:27.759] Guest: Torians and Geminis are very good friends.
[00:56:27.779 - 00:56:28.601] Guest: How are you enjoying this podcast?
[00:56:29.121 - 00:56:30.624] Host: I am enjoying it a lot.
[00:56:30.704 - 00:56:35.271] Host: It's very different because it's not about what's happening.
[00:56:35.331 - 00:56:38.375] Host: It's about life, about very different things.
[00:56:38.415 - 00:56:39.697] Host: I've never talked about these things.
[00:56:39.898 - 00:56:41.039] Guest: I just wanted to meet you.
[00:56:41.580 - 00:56:42.902] Guest: I did a lot of minimum planning.
[00:56:42.942 - 00:56:45.646] Guest: I just watched the episode of Rendezvous Sumigarwal.
[00:56:45.666 - 00:56:47.289] Guest: This is my genuine question for you.
[00:56:48.010 - 00:56:50.674] Guest: Like, can I take a small tangent?
[00:56:51.255 - 00:56:52.837] Guest: Which I have to again tell you.
[00:56:53.097 - 00:56:53.458] Guest: Okay.
[00:56:54.018 - 00:56:58.282] Guest: I am not able to put it in words but I am very grateful for today.
[00:56:58.302 - 00:57:00.404] Guest: And last night...
[00:57:00.424 - 00:57:02.166] Guest: I don't know, I can't believe I am saying this to you.
[00:57:02.186 - 00:57:09.973] Guest: But like... Last night when I was sleeping, I felt a little anxiety before a big day.
[00:57:10.074 - 00:57:12.856] Guest: And I have done 1030 episodes.
[00:57:12.896 - 00:57:15.199] Guest: 1030 episodes.
[00:57:15.219 - 00:57:18.542] Guest: So, I shouldn't feel anxious at this stage.
[00:57:18.562 - 00:57:19.323] Guest: So, I felt anxiety.
[00:57:20.744 - 00:57:22.866] Guest: And then I felt gratitude for that anxiety.
[00:57:23.394 - 00:57:28.459] Guest: that whatever has happened in my life recently and I've got an opportunity again from the world.
[00:57:28.480 - 00:57:32.103] Guest: So I don't even think about today's episode for the past few weeks.
[00:57:32.123 - 00:57:36.248] Guest: I've been thinking about it since last night and I just feel the peak of gratitude.
[00:57:37.249 - 00:57:38.851] Guest: So I wanted to just tell you that.
[00:57:38.951 - 00:57:40.613] Guest: I'm very grateful for your presence.
[00:57:40.873 - 00:57:41.313] Guest: Nothing else.
[00:57:41.754 - 00:57:42.034] Host: Yeah.
[00:57:42.174 - 00:57:49.042] Host: You know, like I was telling someone, I still feel nervous when I go on stage, when I'm performing or whatever I'm doing.
[00:57:49.062 - 00:57:50.083] Host: So I feel nervous.
[00:57:50.283 - 00:57:51.224] Host: You know, you're on the edge.
[00:57:51.845 - 00:57:52.946] Host: So they said it's a good thing.
[00:57:53.282 - 00:57:54.704] Host: It's a good thing, you should be nervous.
[00:57:55.225 - 00:57:57.849] Host: Because that's when, you know, you perform the best.
[00:57:58.750 - 00:57:58.850] Unknown: Yeah.
[00:57:58.870 - 00:57:59.611] Host: When you're a little nervous.
[00:57:59.631 - 00:58:01.434] Host: That energy comes from that nervousness.
[00:58:02.055 - 00:58:04.919] Host: That is an amazing energy to have.
[00:58:05.841 - 00:58:09.726] Host: Because it helps you take that one leap forward from where you are.
[00:58:10.067 - 00:58:10.808] Guest: Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:10.828 - 00:58:17.197] Guest: 100% 100% Because you know you're going to put pressure on yourself to make it the best.
[00:58:17.217 - 00:58:17.718] Guest: Yes, yes.
[00:58:17.798 - 00:58:19.861] Guest: But this is a very important life lesson.
[00:58:19.881 - 00:58:23.026] Guest: Because I remember, from the beginning of any career, people scare you.
[00:58:23.170 - 00:58:25.213] Guest: that the world of career is very dangerous.
[00:58:26.295 - 00:58:30.221] Guest: The truth is you just give 100% keep improving, you'll be fine.
[00:58:32.224 - 00:58:37.112] Guest: At this stage of life, what are you improving or what are you learning?
[00:58:37.292 - 00:58:38.193] Guest: What's up generally?
[00:58:38.474 - 00:58:39.395] Guest: How's your life?
[00:58:40.657 - 00:58:42.280] Host: Life is great.
[00:58:42.460 - 00:58:44.303] Host: My kids have grown up.
[00:58:44.483 - 00:58:45.284] Host: One is in college.
[00:58:46.226 - 00:58:47.588] Host: The other one is working already.
[00:58:47.908 - 00:58:51.474] Host: So he's working with Apple.
[00:58:51.746 - 00:59:13.367] Host: great life here with my husband or getting the kind of roles that I want to do or there's a certain kind of balance in life, there's a certain kind of calm in life and I'm having the best time, you know.
[00:59:13.387 - 00:59:14.007] Guest: Best phase?
[00:59:14.388 - 00:59:15.148] Guest: Best phase of life?
[00:59:15.329 - 00:59:16.230] Host: Yes, absolutely.
[00:59:16.770 - 00:59:20.914] Host: And I say, like different phases come in everyone's life and every phase
[00:59:21.314 - 00:59:22.395] Host: It's like a new canvas.
[00:59:23.377 - 00:59:25.779] Host: You know, treat it like a new canvas every phase in your life.
[00:59:26.320 - 00:59:30.525] Host: And then you can put whatever colors you want on it and you know, make it your own.
[00:59:31.907 - 00:59:33.709] Guest: Are you in touch with some of your childhood friends?
[00:59:34.510 - 00:59:34.771] Guest: Yes.
[00:59:35.712 - 00:59:37.214] Guest: How are their lives now?
[00:59:38.115 - 00:59:39.076] Host: They are having good lives.
[00:59:39.136 - 00:59:39.877] Host: Their...
[00:59:39.897 - 00:59:43.161] Host: I mean, my best friend's daughter has grown up.
[00:59:43.181 - 00:59:44.042] Host: She is working.
[00:59:44.322 - 00:59:45.283] Host: She got married.
[00:59:46.145 - 00:59:47.346] Host: And...
[00:59:47.938 - 00:59:51.022] Host: They are comfortable in whatever they are doing.
[00:59:51.743 - 00:59:58.492] Guest: Do you notice anyone who you grew up with having a bit of a rough time right now in life?
[00:59:59.453 - 01:00:01.336] Guest: And what has been your advice to them?
[01:00:02.297 - 01:00:05.061] Host: Fortunately, there is no one I know who is having a rough time.
[01:00:05.902 - 01:00:09.747] Host: But I would say that look at it like this too shall pass.
[01:00:11.389 - 01:00:13.132] Host: This too will pass.
[01:00:14.133 - 01:00:17.938] Host: And at that time, it's very important to keep your calm.
[01:00:18.818 - 01:00:20.020] Host: to keep your wits around you.
[01:00:21.301 - 01:00:24.185] Host: You have to be patient.
[01:00:24.205 - 01:00:27.089] Host: And live every day.
[01:00:28.451 - 01:00:30.914] Host: Don't think ahead that this will happen, this will happen, this will happen.
[01:00:31.175 - 01:00:32.877] Host: Because you psych yourself when you do that.
[01:00:33.418 - 01:00:37.503] Host: So live every day and try to do, make the right choices and try to do your best.
[01:00:38.765 - 01:00:42.250] Host: After every bad time, a good time will come.
[01:00:43.231 - 01:00:45.014] Host: And even the bad time will not stay for so long.
[01:00:45.995 - 01:00:48.338] Host: If you approach it,
[01:00:48.642 - 01:00:51.227] Host: and head on.
[01:00:52.630 - 01:00:56.236] Guest: If I could see a question, I would ask.
[01:00:56.277 - 01:00:57.679] Guest: That's how my whole career has been built.
[01:00:57.779 - 01:01:01.046] Guest: It's not going to be a weird question.
[01:01:02.368 - 01:01:02.729] Guest: Don't worry.
[01:01:03.591 - 01:01:07.538] Guest: I noticed that whenever I talk to a personality,
[01:01:07.714 - 01:01:10.397] Guest: Many of them now understand what a podcast is.
[01:01:10.417 - 01:01:13.700] Guest: But everyone comes into podcasts expecting a journalistic interview.
[01:01:14.560 - 01:01:17.583] Guest: Where for headlines... Because we are used to that.
[01:01:17.603 - 01:01:18.804] Host: Question and answers like that.
[01:01:18.985 - 01:01:20.926] Host: Like questions about your career or your life.
[01:01:21.987 - 01:01:23.149] Host: And...
[01:01:23.169 - 01:01:27.272] Host: So that format is always in our mind.
[01:01:27.373 - 01:01:27.873] Guest: Yeah.
[01:01:27.893 - 01:01:30.736] Guest: I also think it's the exact reason why...
[01:01:30.916 - 01:01:35.120] Guest: Journalistic interviews do not get traction anymore.
[01:01:35.140 - 01:01:37.362] Guest: Because the people sitting in front of you...
[01:01:37.666 - 01:01:40.068] Guest: There's an element of disrespect in those questions.
[01:01:40.989 - 01:01:44.352] Guest: I can ask so many more spicy questions to all my guests.
[01:01:44.372 - 01:01:52.520] Guest: But I don't out of the fact that when I'm dying, I don't want them to hold that against me on my deathbed.
[01:01:53.441 - 01:01:56.584] Guest: And I feel that negative aura increases.
[01:01:56.964 - 01:01:59.947] Guest: When you throw disrespect on people.
[01:02:00.547 - 01:02:02.789] Host: Everybody has worked hard to be where they are.
[01:02:03.670 - 01:02:06.273] Host: Or everybody has been through a lot in their own lives.
[01:02:06.853 - 01:02:07.634] Host: They don't need that.
[01:02:08.610 - 01:02:11.734] Guest: I usually ask questions on behalf of people.
[01:02:11.974 - 01:02:13.536] Guest: The things I think can heal the world.
[01:02:15.559 - 01:02:21.086] Guest: I feel that the age bracket of the 50s and 60s... ...and I see my mom also going through these things.
[01:02:21.166 - 01:02:22.828] Guest: I see my mami, my masis.
[01:02:24.370 - 01:02:26.473] Guest: There are some mental health up and downs of women.
[01:02:27.093 - 01:02:29.196] Guest: Partly because of menopause, partly because of life.
[01:02:30.217 - 01:02:32.460] Guest: There is something called emptiness syndrome.
[01:02:32.480 - 01:02:34.082] Host: Emptiness because your kids are no longer there.
[01:02:34.102 - 01:02:36.946] Host: So you feel like a vacuum in your life.
[01:02:37.442 - 01:02:42.387] Guest: So in your age group, how do women help each other?
[01:02:42.507 - 01:02:44.148] Guest: And how can we help each other through the screen?
[01:02:44.609 - 01:02:45.870] Guest: How can we help the women watching this?
[01:02:46.891 - 01:02:48.793] Host: Well, I'll say that, you know...
[01:02:49.614 - 01:02:55.179] Host: I know that when there are children at home... ...your life is all around them.
[01:02:55.619 - 01:02:57.841] Host: Everything is orbiting around them.
[01:02:58.903 - 01:03:03.567] Host: And as soon as they leave... ...they fly the nest basically.
[01:03:03.607 - 01:03:06.770] Host: They are doing their own thing.
[01:03:06.946 - 01:03:08.467] Host: They go to college.
[01:03:08.487 - 01:03:10.289] Host: They have to do so many things in college.
[01:03:10.770 - 01:03:14.133] Host: So they don't get time to message or pick up the phone.
[01:03:14.513 - 01:03:15.795] Host: Mom is calling, calling.
[01:03:15.815 - 01:03:16.595] Host: Can I call you later?
[01:03:16.635 - 01:03:17.196] Host: All that.
[01:03:17.937 - 01:03:20.299] Host: So suddenly they feel a vacuum around them.
[01:03:20.319 - 01:03:21.680] Host: They feel like, oh my God.
[01:03:22.221 - 01:03:29.848] Host: The thing I was running so much for, the thing I spent my whole life for, now suddenly it's gone.
[01:03:30.188 - 01:03:31.630] Host: Now she's on her own.
[01:03:32.150 - 01:03:33.111] Host: Of course, her husband is there.
[01:03:33.311 - 01:03:34.272] Host: I'm not talking about that.
[01:03:34.332 - 01:03:35.954] Host: But I'm saying, personally,
[01:03:36.034 - 01:03:40.579] Host: The vested emotion in your children.
[01:03:40.599 - 01:03:43.263] Host: So I feel it's very important to take up something that you love.
[01:03:43.964 - 01:03:44.584] Host: At that point.
[01:03:45.205 - 01:03:46.627] Host: Something that you're passionate about.
[01:03:47.247 - 01:03:48.028] Host: And start doing that.
[01:03:48.048 - 01:03:49.831] Host: It could be the stupidest thing.
[01:03:50.592 - 01:03:53.855] Host: Yes, I want to go to the temple and do something.
[01:03:53.875 - 01:03:55.297] Host: I want to go there.
[01:03:55.517 - 01:03:56.218] Host: So you start that.
[01:03:56.579 - 01:03:57.380] Host: You like to walk.
[01:03:57.800 - 01:03:58.581] Host: Start walking.
[01:03:59.022 - 01:04:00.143] Host: You like to knit.
[01:04:00.543 - 01:04:02.226] Host: Or you like some sort of art.
[01:04:02.246 - 01:04:02.906] Host: Start doing it.
[01:04:03.527 - 01:04:03.767] Host: You know?
[01:04:04.288 - 01:04:05.970] Host: Start occupying your time.
[01:04:06.338 - 01:04:13.628] Host: and start doing something that you have loved all your life but not got actually an opportunity to do it because you had other things to do.
[01:04:14.429 - 01:04:17.353] Host: You had a lot of other things.
[01:04:17.373 - 01:04:19.636] Host: You didn't get the chance to do it.
[01:04:20.257 - 01:04:22.420] Host: Take those hobbies and start doing them.
[01:04:23.321 - 01:04:24.563] Host: Invest yourself in those.
[01:04:25.724 - 01:04:29.810] Host: So what happens is that you are doing something that interests you.
[01:04:30.050 - 01:04:38.801] Host: So your children, who haven't called you yet, who have sent you three messages, haven't got an answer yet, who are always worried.
[01:04:39.181 - 01:04:42.505] Host: You have to get over that because they are also busy in their college.
[01:04:42.585 - 01:04:44.327] Host: They always don't get time to call you.
[01:04:45.008 - 01:04:46.590] Host: So start doing that.
[01:04:46.610 - 01:04:53.118] Host: Start doing something that you are passionate about or want to take up and start learning something.
[01:04:54.640 - 01:04:56.923] Host: So start making your own life.
[01:04:58.905 - 01:04:59.506] Guest: You know,
[01:04:59.810 - 01:05:06.019] Guest: I feel I'm in that position of the child of a mom who's just in her 60s right now.
[01:05:06.800 - 01:05:12.609] Guest: I feel that I'm not talking for just myself but in my entire generation there are a lot of mental health problems.
[01:05:12.629 - 01:05:14.031] Guest: There's a lot of anxiety.
[01:05:14.051 - 01:05:15.774] Guest: I mean there's a crazy amount of anxiety.
[01:05:16.214 - 01:05:18.998] Guest: And there's a lot of ups and downs in everyone's mind.
[01:05:19.018 - 01:05:27.431] Guest: So in the middle of all that, Burji, sometimes you get lost in your own loneliness.
[01:05:28.312 - 01:05:29.554] Guest: But you still love your mom.
[01:05:29.634 - 01:05:30.115] Guest: and your dad.
[01:05:31.457 - 01:05:35.582] Guest: So, I feel too many people are navigating that right now.
[01:05:35.602 - 01:05:36.944] Guest: It's very tricky times even.
[01:05:37.145 - 01:05:40.209] Host: It's tricky for the kids also and it's tricky for the parents also.
[01:05:40.770 - 01:05:43.233] Host: Because the kids are not visible in front of them.
[01:05:43.253 - 01:05:44.895] Host: They go to college here and there.
[01:05:44.915 - 01:05:48.260] Host: There are very few who are doing college at home.
[01:05:48.661 - 01:05:53.788] Host: Many of them go out of station to some other place for their education.
[01:05:54.208 - 01:05:57.673] Host: So, they are not visible in front of them.
[01:05:58.134 - 01:05:58.194] Unknown: And
[01:05:58.370 - 01:06:00.654] Host: Because they are so busy, they are not even replying.
[01:06:01.054 - 01:06:03.098] Host: So they are also in their world.
[01:06:03.118 - 01:06:06.223] Host: Where they are relying on their friends for the support.
[01:06:07.525 - 01:06:12.232] Host: Whether they are the right friends or not, all these things happen.
[01:06:12.252 - 01:06:14.276] Host: But everybody has to go through this.
[01:06:14.857 - 01:06:16.760] Host: And I think that's when the children also learn.
[01:06:17.281 - 01:06:20.626] Host: And there is one thing that you have taught your children.
[01:06:21.378 - 01:06:22.580] Host: You have taught them everything.
[01:06:23.141 - 01:06:26.165] Host: I say that you should give values to your children.
[01:06:26.185 - 01:06:26.726] Host: I have given them.
[01:06:26.806 - 01:06:27.707] Host: Respect everybody.
[01:06:27.808 - 01:06:28.248] Host: Do this.
[01:06:29.210 - 01:06:30.992] Host: Do the right thing in any situation.
[01:06:32.655 - 01:06:36.040] Host: You know, you teach them everything very well.
[01:06:36.541 - 01:06:43.671] Host: So trust them that once they are there, they will bring those learned things to work.
[01:06:44.793 - 01:06:45.053] Host: You know.
[01:06:45.614 - 01:06:48.338] Host: Trust them a little.
[01:06:48.418 - 01:06:52.203] Host: There will be ups and downs, because they are also discovering life.
[01:06:52.683 - 01:06:58.731] Host: For the first time, alone, on their own, they have started their own life.
[01:06:58.751 - 01:07:00.834] Host: So, there may be some wrong decisions.
[01:07:00.874 - 01:07:04.258] Host: But you should support your children.
[01:07:04.639 - 01:07:06.781] Host: And make sure that they go through those rough times.
[01:07:07.002 - 01:07:10.847] Host: And come back and bring stability in their life.
[01:07:11.327 - 01:07:12.769] Guest: Please correct me if I'm wrong, okay?
[01:07:13.630 - 01:07:14.651] Guest: I know this.
[01:07:14.772 - 01:07:16.754] Guest: In a romantic relationship,
[01:07:16.898 - 01:07:24.608] Guest: If your communication skills are good and if you are able to communicate the things in your heart.
[01:07:24.628 - 01:07:27.371] Guest: That is a skill and you can improve over time.
[01:07:27.391 - 01:07:32.478] Guest: In the same way, I feel that communicating well with mom and dad is a skill.
[01:07:32.798 - 01:07:33.920] Host: Yeah, it's very important.
[01:07:34.400 - 01:07:34.921] Host: Right?
[01:07:34.941 - 01:07:37.524] Host: But this communication line has to be open from childhood.
[01:07:37.745 - 01:07:39.266] Guest: From both sides?
[01:07:39.507 - 01:07:40.228] Host: From both sides.
[01:07:40.788 - 01:07:42.390] Host: It has to be open.
[01:07:42.410 - 01:07:45.234] Host: Because it can't be done in one go.
[01:07:45.378 - 01:07:46.099] Host: It takes time.
[01:07:46.400 - 01:07:47.762] Host: It cannot happen all of a sudden.
[01:07:48.423 - 01:07:54.091] Guest: I also feel that when you turn 30, you kind of have to take the role of a parent in some capacities.
[01:07:54.993 - 01:07:57.196] Guest: And just be more understanding in those situations.
[01:07:57.437 - 01:08:00.582] Host: Yes, like I always say that our generation is a sandwich generation.
[01:08:01.563 - 01:08:04.928] Host: Because we are caring for our parents and for our kids.
[01:08:04.948 - 01:08:06.891] Host: So we are taking care of both sides.
[01:08:07.572 - 01:08:09.615] Host: Because your parents also become like kids.
[01:08:10.817 - 01:08:12.300] Host: And your kids are still kids.
[01:08:12.340 - 01:08:13.842] Host: But parents are also...
[01:08:14.274 - 01:08:16.696] Host: They become like kids.
[01:08:16.737 - 01:08:18.078] Host: Because they are also getting older.
[01:08:18.578 - 01:08:19.660] Host: They have their ways.
[01:08:19.680 - 01:08:21.822] Host: They get set in their own ways.
[01:08:22.222 - 01:08:23.984] Host: So they also don't want to change.
[01:08:24.825 - 01:08:27.568] Host: So you have to take care of them and you have to take care of your kids.
[01:08:27.588 - 01:08:31.332] Host: So I call them the sandwich generation.
[01:08:31.552 - 01:08:34.495] Guest: It's almost the challenge of life at that stage.
[01:08:34.515 - 01:08:36.797] Host: Yeah, but I mean, what's life without challenges?
[01:08:36.817 - 01:08:38.919] Host: There should be challenges.
[01:08:39.240 - 01:08:41.522] Host: And how do you handle them?
[01:08:41.858 - 01:08:44.902] Host: That's the most interesting thing to me.
[01:08:45.443 - 01:08:48.186] Guest: It's all about attitude towards it.
[01:08:48.206 - 01:08:49.248] Guest: Navigating with grace.
[01:08:49.508 - 01:08:49.769] Host: Yes.
[01:08:51.431 - 01:08:52.692] Guest: Your vision of seeing that challenge.
[01:08:53.313 - 01:08:55.716] Host: Yeah, navigating it with grace.
[01:08:55.737 - 01:08:57.839] Host: You put it very, very, very nicely.
[01:08:58.680 - 01:09:01.584] Host: Because you have to give in a lot sometimes.
[01:09:02.125 - 01:09:05.630] Host: You have to give a lot from both sides.
[01:09:06.150 - 01:09:09.094] Host: Like to your parents, you have to give a lot because you got a lot from them.
[01:09:09.895 - 01:09:11.858] Host: How much have your parents given you?
[01:09:12.226 - 01:09:14.209] Host: So you have to give on this side.
[01:09:14.630 - 01:09:16.933] Host: And on this side, because they are your responsibilities.
[01:09:16.973 - 01:09:18.315] Host: So you're giving on this side.
[01:09:19.557 - 01:09:20.559] Host: It's very hard.
[01:09:20.599 - 01:09:22.481] Host: It's a very hard time.
[01:09:22.501 - 01:09:31.315] Host: But I think our generation, I think we are... We have been through a lot.
[01:09:32.717 - 01:09:33.678] Host: We came from nothing.
[01:09:34.479 - 01:09:36.923] Host: We have achieved everything with our lives.
[01:09:38.966 - 01:09:41.490] Host: So we are warriors, basically.
[01:09:41.698 - 01:09:42.559] Host: Yeah.
[01:09:43.321 - 01:09:44.743] Host: And we see it through.
[01:09:45.043 - 01:09:47.106] Host: We see everything through.
[01:09:47.667 - 01:09:52.094] Guest: You're talking about pre-liberalization outside India.
[01:09:52.114 - 01:09:52.815] Guest: 80s, 70s, 60s.
[01:09:52.875 - 01:09:55.259] Guest: It was a very different time.
[01:09:56.621 - 01:10:00.147] Guest: At your stage of life, what is this parent-child relationship?
[01:10:00.788 - 01:10:02.570] Guest: What does it feel like to see your parents?
[01:10:03.332 - 01:10:04.293] Guest: Sorry to put it that way.
[01:10:04.634 - 01:10:07.478] Guest: But like, I'm asking for perspective for my generation also.
[01:10:07.498 - 01:10:08.299] Host: Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:08.319 - 01:10:10.002] Host: Because I think...
[01:10:10.594 - 01:10:11.896] Host: Sometimes it's very sad.
[01:10:11.996 - 01:10:22.489] Host: Sometimes, like to see someone lose their faculties, or their mind which was so sharp is not there anymore.
[01:10:22.969 - 01:10:24.792] Host: But they start repeating things, you know.
[01:10:27.735 - 01:10:29.377] Host: And then you are like, oh my God.
[01:10:29.518 - 01:10:33.142] Host: I mean, she was so intelligent, or he was so intelligent.
[01:10:33.262 - 01:10:39.410] Host: And today, you know, she cannot remember what she ate in the afternoon, what she ate in the morning.
[01:10:39.746 - 01:10:42.350] Host: So, they start losing those kind of things.
[01:10:43.351 - 01:10:47.177] Host: Or you just have to remind them, you have to be patient.
[01:10:47.958 - 01:10:49.400] Host: You need a lot of patience.
[01:10:49.440 - 01:11:01.819] Host: Or I think that's the most, like, sad thing to see your parents like.
[01:11:02.460 - 01:11:09.330] Host: Because you have always idolized them for being like the smartest, for being the best, for doing everything,
[01:11:09.698 - 01:11:14.645] Host: And today you see them not having that kind of faculty anymore.
[01:11:15.366 - 01:11:17.889] Host: So, it's very hard to see your parents.
[01:11:18.250 - 01:11:21.474] Guest: Does it change your own perspective on your own life?
[01:11:22.095 - 01:11:22.516] Guest: Seeing that?
[01:11:23.257 - 01:11:27.963] Host: Well, I mean, when you see your parents and you see them and you think of your own mortality, obviously.
[01:11:28.644 - 01:11:30.627] Host: You know, you think about that too.
[01:11:30.647 - 01:11:33.871] Host: It's like, my mom is going through this, will I be going through this as well?
[01:11:33.891 - 01:11:36.935] Host: So, all these things, of course, you think about it.
[01:11:37.256 - 01:11:38.898] Guest: That's why I ask people that,
[01:11:39.074 - 01:11:41.017] Guest: whether they think about their death or not.
[01:11:41.618 - 01:11:43.681] Guest: I think it's an important life question.
[01:11:43.741 - 01:11:45.303] Host: Do you think about your death?
[01:11:45.323 - 01:11:46.625] Guest: Yes, very much.
[01:11:46.865 - 01:11:47.286] Guest: Very much.
[01:11:47.446 - 01:11:49.770] Guest: In almost a romantic way, but not in a morbid way.
[01:11:51.452 - 01:11:53.655] Guest: I mean, it's not that death is love.
[01:11:54.296 - 01:12:04.051] Guest: But I think at least in Indian culture, if you really study the Shastras, it says that just be peaceful about death.
[01:12:04.071 - 01:12:05.934] Guest: And work towards being peaceful.
[01:12:05.954 - 01:12:08.978] Guest: A monk came to the show and said a very right thing, which stayed with me.
[01:12:09.250 - 01:12:13.916] Guest: He said that death is the exam and life is your preparation time.
[01:12:13.936 - 01:12:17.620] Guest: So, that's a very nice, peaceful way of looking at death.
[01:12:18.301 - 01:12:19.062] Guest: But...
[01:12:20.303 - 01:12:26.791] Guest: I spoke to an actor roughly like 30 years older than me.
[01:12:26.811 - 01:12:29.174] Guest: 25-30 years older than me.
[01:12:29.194 - 01:12:30.356] Guest: And he didn't want to talk about it.
[01:12:31.116 - 01:12:33.539] Guest: And then on that podcast we debated for 20 minutes.
[01:12:34.380 - 01:12:39.026] Guest: But I guess everyone has their own pace of understanding this problem.
[01:12:39.330 - 01:12:43.695] Guest: But it's a very important thing to understand mortality.
[01:12:43.715 - 01:12:45.477] Guest: I would love to hear your opinion on it.
[01:12:46.358 - 01:12:47.739] Guest: Or if you think I'm just thinking 2D.
[01:12:48.220 - 01:12:49.201] Guest: Or debate, that's fine.
[01:12:49.621 - 01:12:51.623] Host: No, I think it's an eventuality.
[01:12:51.843 - 01:12:52.925] Host: Everybody has to go through it.
[01:12:53.785 - 01:12:55.147] Host: Right?
[01:12:55.167 - 01:12:57.650] Host: Or I don't think about it so much.
[01:12:58.931 - 01:13:00.072] Host: It has to happen, it'll happen.
[01:13:00.252 - 01:13:01.574] Host: It'll happen whenever it has to happen.
[01:13:02.335 - 01:13:04.197] Host: And that's something beyond your control.
[01:13:04.577 - 01:13:05.558] Host: You cannot control that.
[01:13:06.299 - 01:13:09.202] Host: You have, first of all, no idea.
[01:13:09.474 - 01:13:16.482] Host: You have no power over it.
[01:13:17.303 - 01:13:18.144] Host: Right?
[01:13:18.165 - 01:13:19.746] Host: You can't control it.
[01:13:19.766 - 01:13:22.169] Host: You don't have power over it.
[01:13:23.491 - 01:13:24.893] Host: It will happen when it has to happen.
[01:13:25.033 - 01:13:26.334] Host: So why think so much about it?
[01:13:28.036 - 01:13:35.606] Guest: Would you ever use mortality and death as a source to learn darkness for something like Mrs. Deshpande to channelize those emotions there?
[01:13:38.349 - 01:13:39.250] Host: What do you mean by that?
[01:13:39.714 - 01:13:41.456] Guest: We have talked about Mrs. Deshpande's darkness.
[01:13:41.756 - 01:13:45.560] Guest: What is dark in the world according to you?
[01:13:46.081 - 01:13:48.143] Host: I think badness in a person.
[01:13:48.383 - 01:13:48.924] Host: Evil?
[01:13:48.944 - 01:13:49.184] Host: Evil.
[01:13:50.085 - 01:13:53.649] Guest: And your job is to stay away from it.
[01:13:53.669 - 01:13:56.212] Guest: Protect yourself and stay away from it.
[01:13:56.232 - 01:13:57.193] Host: Not for Deshpande.
[01:13:58.815 - 01:13:59.936] Guest: You have to channelize there.
[01:14:01.538 - 01:14:04.801] Guest: I am a little scared.
[01:14:04.821 - 01:14:04.981] Host: Why?
[01:14:05.042 - 01:14:05.522] Host: Why are you scared?
[01:14:06.946 - 01:14:13.252] Host: Your energy... Have you ever seen someone's... What have I seen?
[01:14:13.272 - 01:14:17.997] Host: Have you ever seen someone's eyes being illuminated?
[01:14:18.057 - 01:14:23.502] Host: Have you ever seen... ...a man... ...falling into desperation in the end?
[01:14:23.542 - 01:14:25.804] Host: Have you ever seen that?
[01:14:25.824 - 01:14:28.447] Host: No, ma'am.
[01:14:28.467 - 01:14:35.774] Host: When he takes his last breath... ...what expression does he have in his eyes?
[01:14:35.794 - 01:14:36.274] Host: Have you ever seen that?
[01:14:37.410 - 01:14:41.495] Guest: Have you thought about it?
[01:14:41.515 - 01:14:41.775] Guest: No.
[01:14:47.382 - 01:14:49.765] Host: I am thinking about where Madhuri Dixit went.
[01:14:49.785 - 01:14:51.467] Host: You suddenly went into the topic of death and death.
[01:14:51.487 - 01:14:52.308] Host: I said, oh God!
[01:14:52.328 - 01:14:54.571] Host: Where are they taking the conversation?
[01:14:54.971 - 01:14:57.455] Host: That is a skill of acting.
[01:14:57.475 - 01:15:02.000] Guest: I am kind of scared right now.
[01:15:02.020 - 01:15:04.483] Host: No, this was what Deshpande was saying.
[01:15:04.683 - 01:15:05.244] Host: Mrs. Deshpande's...
[01:15:06.405 - 01:15:06.866] Host: I think...
[01:15:06.978 - 01:15:08.119] Host: But she's not all evil.
[01:15:08.199 - 01:15:08.980] Host: I can tell you that.
[01:15:10.602 - 01:15:12.945] Host: Her...
[01:15:13.365 - 01:15:19.032] Host: Her history or the way she thinks is not completely evil.
[01:15:19.212 - 01:15:20.393] Host: She's not an evil person.
[01:15:20.453 - 01:15:20.954] Guest: It's layered.
[01:15:21.755 - 01:15:22.235] Host: It's layered.
[01:15:22.295 - 01:15:23.236] Host: It's much layered.
[01:15:23.637 - 01:15:27.421] Host: It's all experiences, her life experiences, whatever she's gone through.
[01:15:29.283 - 01:15:30.505] Host: I think...
[01:15:32.046 - 01:15:33.188] Host: Her calmness...
[01:15:33.208 - 01:15:35.250] Host: Her...
[01:15:35.330 - 01:15:38.333] Host: I mean, there is so much noise inside, but on top of that, she is very calm.
[01:15:40.496 - 01:15:41.417] Host: She is also a little dubious.
[01:15:41.437 - 01:15:42.618] Host: She is not trustworthy.
[01:15:43.279 - 01:15:45.421] Host: She is working with the police, but you can never trust her.
[01:15:45.661 - 01:15:49.285] Host: Because she has her own thoughts.
[01:15:49.566 - 01:15:52.469] Host: And she has her own angle on everything.
[01:15:53.590 - 01:15:58.616] Host: So, even when the police is working with her, they are doing it because she is desperate.
[01:15:58.636 - 01:16:01.719] Host: That something bad is happening and they need her, you know.
[01:16:02.480 - 01:16:04.242] Host: So, she is not there because of that.
[01:16:05.538 - 01:16:09.925] Host: You can't say what she's going to do when and what she can.
[01:16:10.606 - 01:16:13.029] Host: She's capable of a lot more.
[01:16:13.710 - 01:16:16.695] Guest: I feel like you enjoyed yourself a lot.
[01:16:16.715 - 01:16:18.918] Guest: Playing this character.
[01:16:18.938 - 01:16:19.439] Guest: You're a lot of fun.
[01:16:19.459 - 01:16:25.748] Host: Yeah, because you know, it's always been like Guddi Guddi, so sweet, you know, those kind of characters that I've played so far.
[01:16:26.349 - 01:16:31.477] Host: And I thought this has so much in her.
[01:16:31.557 - 01:16:35.122] Host: Like it's an onion, you know, you peel and you peel layers and you peel layers.
[01:16:35.618 - 01:16:39.103] Host: And it's very well written.
[01:16:39.163 - 01:16:41.406] Host: And Nagesh, of course, is a fantastic director.
[01:16:41.887 - 01:16:43.389] Host: I'm working with him for the first time.
[01:16:44.030 - 01:16:47.314] Host: And I liked working with him.
[01:16:47.374 - 01:16:50.839] Host: Because he's very true to the script.
[01:16:52.101 - 01:16:54.824] Host: He's not like this or that.
[01:16:54.865 - 01:16:55.786] Host: I've seen his films.
[01:16:56.787 - 01:16:59.571] Host: He's very focused on the characters.
[01:17:00.332 - 01:17:01.974] Host: He doesn't let the character move.
[01:17:02.014 - 01:17:03.196] Host: Not even a little bit.
[01:17:03.216 - 01:17:04.658] Host: And we needed that precision.
[01:17:04.962 - 01:17:05.623] Host: for this script.
[01:17:07.204 - 01:17:11.549] Host: That's why I said yes because Applaus is also producing it and they are also very good producers.
[01:17:12.410 - 01:17:20.119] Host: Nagesh is a fantastic director and the script is so different that I needed these kind of people to back it when I am there in the film.
[01:17:20.739 - 01:17:23.562] Host: So let's see.
[01:17:23.582 - 01:17:33.673] Guest: I hope someone has made a reel where Mrs. Deshpande keeps one video and who we are in the other.
[01:17:33.693 - 01:17:34.194] Guest: Same person.
[01:17:34.306 - 01:17:35.828] Guest: range.
[01:17:35.848 - 01:17:37.309] Guest: That should be the title.
[01:17:37.469 - 01:17:48.061] Host: For an actor, it's fun to play different characters because you have to feel versatile.
[01:17:48.882 - 01:17:49.703] Unknown: Feel versatile?
[01:17:49.723 - 01:17:50.844] Host: Yeah, feel versatile.
[01:17:51.405 - 01:17:55.329] Host: You can't play the same character again and again and again.
[01:17:55.369 - 01:18:00.114] Host: You have to try different things and it's like
[01:18:00.930 - 01:18:03.833] Host: It's like how you go for a buffet and you're trying different things.
[01:18:03.913 - 01:18:04.914] Host: It has a different taste.
[01:18:04.934 - 01:18:06.996] Host: So there are different characters.
[01:18:07.016 - 01:18:11.100] Host: Someone is like that, someone is like that, someone is sweet, someone is sour.
[01:18:11.761 - 01:18:14.703] Guest: Who were you during Hama Aap Ke Hai Kon days?
[01:18:14.723 - 01:18:15.204] Host: Who was I?
[01:18:15.464 - 01:18:16.305] Host: I was me?
[01:18:17.066 - 01:18:21.570] Guest: Like who was the person behind Madhuri Dixit?
[01:18:22.231 - 01:18:25.294] Host: I was just playing myself I guess in that role.
[01:18:26.115 - 01:18:28.197] Host: It's that Nisha was very close to who I am.
[01:18:28.837 - 01:18:29.618] Host: That person.
[01:18:29.922 - 01:18:31.144] Host: It's very close to who I am.
[01:18:31.165 - 01:18:31.966] Host: I love families.
[01:18:32.066 - 01:18:34.231] Host: I love bringing people together.
[01:18:34.251 - 01:18:39.482] Host: I love peace in a family.
[01:18:39.782 - 01:18:42.648] Host: I am the peacemaker kind of in a family.
[01:18:42.668 - 01:18:44.572] Host: So I am that character.
[01:18:45.213 - 01:18:49.522] Guest: When you and Salman Khan meet now, we both talk about who you are.
[01:18:51.426 - 01:18:54.069] Host: First of all, we don't meet that much.
[01:18:54.089 - 01:18:56.031] Host: And when we meet, we don't talk about the movies.
[01:18:56.051 - 01:18:57.393] Host: We talk about, hey, how are you doing?
[01:18:57.934 - 01:18:58.254] Host: What's going on?
[01:18:58.274 - 01:18:59.035] Host: You know, other things.
[01:18:59.115 - 01:19:00.877] Guest: No nostalgia about...
[01:19:00.897 - 01:19:04.121] Host: Nostalgia means when we meet, maybe we meet on the show.
[01:19:04.141 - 01:19:07.224] Host: They make us do that nostalgia.
[01:19:07.244 - 01:19:08.846] Host: They want to do that Gulel thing.
[01:19:08.866 - 01:19:09.967] Host: They want to do all that.
[01:19:09.988 - 01:19:11.730] Host: So, they get greedy, all the show people.
[01:19:12.170 - 01:19:16.956] Host: So, we get some elements of who we are.
[01:19:16.976 - 01:19:19.058] Guest: The set's memories are still fresh.
[01:19:19.618 - 01:19:20.299] Host: Oh, yeah.
[01:19:20.439 - 01:19:23.402] Host: I mean, it was so much fun being on that set.
[01:19:23.422 - 01:19:25.383] Host: Because we really became like a family.
[01:19:25.403 - 01:19:26.284] Host: And when...
[01:19:26.304 - 01:19:27.626] Host: I remember, it was the last day.
[01:19:28.226 - 01:19:30.468] Host: And they...
[01:19:30.488 - 01:19:33.331] Host: I mean, before announcing the pack-up, they played a song.
[01:19:33.371 - 01:19:34.692] Host: Tumse Juda Hukar.
[01:19:35.193 - 01:19:36.414] Host: Mujhe Door Jaana Hai.
[01:19:36.454 - 01:19:37.655] Host: Pal Bhar Ki Jo.
[01:19:37.675 - 01:19:38.536] Host: We all started crying.
[01:19:38.876 - 01:19:41.459] Host: Everybody was crying on the set.
[01:19:41.939 - 01:19:44.121] Host: Because really, we had become like a family.
[01:19:44.241 - 01:19:47.965] Host: Because we lived together for 12-12 years.
[01:19:48.005 - 01:19:49.266] Host: 10-10, 15-15 days.
[01:19:49.698 - 01:19:53.763] Host: So, we had become attached to each other.
[01:19:56.106 - 01:19:57.748] Host: We had become caring about each other.
[01:19:57.768 - 01:20:02.013] Host: We were interested in what's happening in each other's lives and everything.
[01:20:02.053 - 01:20:05.738] Host: When we parted ways, we knew which set we would meet.
[01:20:05.758 - 01:20:07.860] Host: We didn't know when we would meet.
[01:20:07.880 - 01:20:09.402] Host: So, we all were very sad.
[01:20:09.523 - 01:20:12.967] Guest: Was young Salman Khan a crook on set?
[01:20:15.910 - 01:20:18.834] Host: He was very naughty, you can say.
[01:20:19.074 - 01:20:21.037] Host: Not in a negative way, but in a very sweet way.
[01:20:21.398 - 01:20:21.918] Guest: Cute.
[01:20:21.939 - 01:20:22.600] Host: Yeah, cute way.
[01:20:22.660 - 01:20:23.501] Host: He was...
[01:20:24.202 - 01:20:25.664] Host: He...
[01:20:25.684 - 01:20:28.228] Host: I mean, he used to get scolded every day from Suraj Bajatia.
[01:20:28.849 - 01:20:32.074] Host: Salman Bhai, please concentrate on what you're doing.
[01:20:32.094 - 01:20:33.457] Host: And scolding means, Suraj Bajatia's scolding.
[01:20:33.497 - 01:20:38.565] Host: He used to tell him very sweetly, Salman Bhai, I'm going to get angry now.
[01:20:39.065 - 01:20:41.750] Host: Please concentrate on what you're doing.
[01:20:42.591 - 01:20:42.811] Host: So...
[01:20:43.392 - 01:20:47.058] Host: But yes, that added to the whole, you know, charm.
[01:20:47.202 - 01:20:49.345] Host: of, who are we to you?
[01:20:49.365 - 01:20:52.929] Guest: Even in his acting, you can see his cute mischief.
[01:20:52.949 - 01:20:57.235] Guest: In Prem face.
[01:20:57.255 - 01:21:00.859] Guest: I think because of that cute mischief, his whole career has gone forward.
[01:21:01.761 - 01:21:03.162] Host: Like he grew, that's what people know.
[01:21:03.182 - 01:21:03.803] Host: It has helped him.
[01:21:04.684 - 01:21:08.149] Host: That's why Chulbul Pandey became so popular.
[01:21:08.569 - 01:21:09.410] Host: One of his characters.
[01:21:10.151 - 01:21:10.852] Host: He's like a Chulbul.
[01:21:10.872 - 01:21:15.378] Guest: By the way, there's one more very iconic movie.
[01:21:15.906 - 01:21:16.948] Guest: It's a movie you've done.
[01:21:17.088 - 01:21:19.292] Guest: I think it's called Hum Tumha Re Aisa Nam.
[01:21:19.512 - 01:21:21.355] Host: Hum Tumha Re Aisa Nam.
[01:21:21.375 - 01:21:21.475] Guest: Yes.
[01:21:21.495 - 01:21:23.559] Guest: Where Shah Rukh Khan is, Salman Khan is Madhuri Dixit.
[01:21:23.579 - 01:21:23.900] Guest: Yes.
[01:21:24.080 - 01:21:24.581] Guest: Two iconic.
[01:21:24.961 - 01:21:26.544] Guest: And Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan have a fight.
[01:21:26.564 - 01:21:28.988] Guest: That scene went viral on the algorithms.
[01:21:29.389 - 01:21:29.850] Host: Oh yeah.
[01:21:29.870 - 01:21:31.653] Host: I mean it's a very cute script.
[01:21:32.214 - 01:21:40.948] Host: The script was very cute and of course, the casting was absolutely right.
[01:21:40.968 - 01:21:41.970] Host: So, it was a...
[01:21:42.402 - 01:21:43.123] Host: Very cute.
[01:21:43.203 - 01:21:44.846] Host: And the director was also very nice.
[01:21:44.866 - 01:21:45.747] Host: He was the director of South.
[01:21:46.589 - 01:21:47.350] Host: And...
[01:21:48.051 - 01:21:51.937] Host: There's so many ad-libs that even Shah Rukh and Salman have done in that movie.
[01:21:52.117 - 01:21:53.099] Host: It's amazing.
[01:21:53.119 - 01:21:56.264] Guest: There was this phase of your life where you were in the US, very away from Mumbai.
[01:21:56.785 - 01:21:57.526] Host: Yeah.
[01:21:57.546 - 01:21:58.568] Guest: How was your life back then?
[01:21:59.810 - 01:22:00.290] Guest: Amazing.

[01:22:01.673 - 01:22:02.895] Host: Peaceful, amazing.
[01:22:02.975 - 01:22:05.158] Host: I had my kids and...
[01:22:06.661 - 01:22:10.066] Host: I was spending every moment with them.
[01:22:10.434 - 01:22:11.776] Host: Living my dream basically.
[01:22:11.816 - 01:22:12.797] Host: Looking after them.
[01:22:13.518 - 01:22:14.939] Host: Taking them to the park.
[01:22:15.039 - 01:22:15.960] Host: Playing with them.
[01:22:16.020 - 01:22:17.823] Host: Sitting on the swing.
[01:22:17.843 - 01:22:18.543] Host: You know.
[01:22:18.563 - 01:22:19.464] Host: All those kind of things.
[01:22:20.265 - 01:22:21.807] Host: So, it was a lot of fun.
[01:22:21.827 - 01:22:23.809] Guest: How come doctor and you decided to come back?
[01:22:24.350 - 01:22:25.211] Guest: At some point.
[01:22:25.231 - 01:22:26.412] Host: Well, a lot of things happened.
[01:22:27.213 - 01:22:28.194] Host: My parents were with me.
[01:22:28.255 - 01:22:29.136] Host: They were living with me.
[01:22:29.556 - 01:22:31.699] Host: And all my siblings are living there.
[01:22:31.959 - 01:22:32.920] Host: They are all in the US.
[01:22:33.541 - 01:22:35.843] Host: Everyone is there.
[01:22:35.903 - 01:22:36.684] Host: Even Ram's family.
[01:22:36.884 - 01:22:38.226] Host: Their family is also there.
[01:22:38.466 - 01:22:43.232] Host: So my parents getting older, they wanted to come back to India.
[01:22:44.074 - 01:22:49.861] Host: But all my career and my life, they were with me, always with me.
[01:22:50.382 - 01:22:54.868] Host: So I didn't want to leave them alone here because there's not much family around in Mumbai.
[01:22:55.950 - 01:22:57.292] Host: So that was one thing.
[01:22:57.352 - 01:22:59.254] Host: Secondly, my work was here.
[01:22:59.515 - 01:23:02.118] Host: So I was coming here to work and then I used to go back.
[01:23:02.659 - 01:23:07.505] Host: That was becoming very difficult because there's a lot of distance between the US and here.
[01:23:07.525 - 01:23:07.986] Host: And then,
[01:23:08.098 - 01:23:19.189] Host: Ram was also feeling that, you know, I think you have done a podcast with him also to this effect that whenever patients come, they are in a dire state when they come to him.
[01:23:19.669 - 01:23:24.354] Host: Because they have to be operated on, something has gone wrong, he has to operate on them.
[01:23:24.614 - 01:23:26.636] Host: He says, why can't I catch them earlier on?
[01:23:29.539 - 01:23:36.466] Host: I mean, if I can advise patients before all this happens, then I think that will be a better thing than them.
[01:23:36.578 - 01:23:40.023] Host: getting into trouble and then coming to me to get operated.
[01:23:40.644 - 01:23:56.768] Host: So he wanted to develop something in technology, using technology, smart services and AI and everything and create a system to make people healthy, you know, look after their wellness.
[01:23:57.709 - 01:24:00.153] Host: And so that's what he wanted to do too.
[01:24:00.814 - 01:24:06.162] Host: So we thought maybe it's a calling where, you know, everything is coming together.
[01:24:06.626 - 01:24:12.113] Host: And maybe if we move to India, then we can, you know, start...
[01:24:12.133 - 01:24:13.334] Host: I have my work here.
[01:24:13.935 - 01:24:15.797] Host: And he also wanted a change.
[01:24:15.837 - 01:24:21.124] Host: And so, we thought it was a great point for me to move here.
[01:24:21.144 - 01:24:23.807] Host: For us, all of us to move here together.
[01:24:24.328 - 01:24:25.409] Guest: Did you miss India?
[01:24:25.429 - 01:24:28.753] Host: Yes, of course I missed India there.
[01:24:29.034 - 01:24:31.537] Host: Because all my friends were here.
[01:24:31.557 - 01:24:32.738] Host: All my friends were here.
[01:24:32.798 - 01:24:35.922] Host: Some of my family is here.
[01:24:36.354 - 01:24:38.857] Host: So yes, I used to miss India.
[01:24:39.878 - 01:24:41.820] Guest: Did you miss food?
[01:24:41.840 - 01:24:44.684] Host: I used to miss food or try to make stuff there also.
[01:24:44.984 - 01:24:46.726] Host: I used to make food there too.
[01:24:46.746 - 01:24:48.108] Guest: Are you a good cook?
[01:24:48.128 - 01:24:48.949] Host: I am an okay cook.
[01:24:49.249 - 01:24:50.010] Host: I am not bad.
[01:24:50.050 - 01:24:51.912] Host: But you know, I started very late.
[01:24:52.713 - 01:24:55.777] Host: So when I was working, I never got a chance to get into the kitchen.
[01:24:55.837 - 01:25:00.402] Host: I think I learned most of the cooking after my marriage.
[01:25:00.994 - 01:25:02.416] Host: From my husband.
[01:25:02.617 - 01:25:04.520] Host: He is a better cook than me.
[01:25:05.321 - 01:25:06.363] Host: What is the best dish you can make?
[01:25:07.445 - 01:25:11.852] Host: I can make a good khang pao chicken.
[01:25:12.934 - 01:25:16.380] Host: I can make a good Indian dish.
[01:25:16.640 - 01:25:18.643] Host: Sabudana khichdi is good.
[01:25:19.304 - 01:25:23.431] Host: I can make sabudana khichdi.
[01:25:24.954 - 01:25:25.955] Host: I can make different things.
[01:25:25.995 - 01:25:27.538] Host: I can make sabzi wabzi.
[01:25:27.714 - 01:25:30.298] Host: It's a few things that my mom taught me.
[01:25:30.578 - 01:25:31.560] Host: I can make those.
[01:25:31.580 - 01:25:32.862] Guest: What's your favorite dish?
[01:25:33.723 - 01:25:35.266] Host: My favorite dish?
[01:25:35.286 - 01:25:37.589] Host: If I say Maharashtrian, I like Modak very much.

[01:25:39.312 - 01:25:40.975] Host: And I learned to make it also.
[01:25:41.015 - 01:25:42.497] Host: So I'm self-sufficient.
[01:25:42.517 - 01:25:43.939] Host: I can make all Modaks anytime.
[01:25:43.959 - 01:25:47.104] Guest: Coconut, jaggery, rice flour.
[01:25:47.284 - 01:25:49.067] Guest: Then ghee on top.
[01:25:49.308 - 01:25:53.474] Host: I think when Mr. Ganpati comes, that's the best time in my life.
[01:25:54.095 - 01:25:56.018] Host: Because everyday we eat Modaks then.
[01:25:56.162 - 01:25:58.826] Guest: Ganesh Chaturthi tastes like Modak.
[01:25:58.986 - 01:25:59.767] Host: Ganesh Chaturthi, yes.

[01:26:15.628 - 01:26:16.389] Host: Ultimate.
[01:26:16.409 - 01:26:17.010] Host: Oh, Varanbhat.
[01:26:17.282 - 01:26:18.984] Host: I love varan bhaat.
[01:26:19.004 - 01:26:22.307] Host: Varan bhaat, toop and little bit of lemon.
[01:26:22.327 - 01:26:23.309] Guest: It's my comfort.

[01:26:35.862 - 01:26:36.503] Host: What happens?
[01:26:36.523 - 01:26:38.505] Host: Varan bhaat is nothing.
[01:26:38.946 - 01:26:39.466] Host: It's lentils.
[01:26:39.486 - 01:26:43.531] Host: It's lentils and it's rice.
[01:26:43.551 - 01:26:46.674] Host: It doesn't have any spices or anything.
[01:26:46.946 - 01:26:48.808] Host: We just boil it, basically cook it.
[01:26:49.549 - 01:26:51.350] Host: And on the rice, a little ghee.
[01:26:52.812 - 01:26:56.356] Host: A little salt and lemon.
[01:26:56.376 - 01:26:57.317] Host: And it's amazing.
[01:26:57.757 - 01:26:59.899] Guest: Would that be your last meal, if you had a choice?
[01:27:01.521 - 01:27:02.262] Host: Well, I don't know.
[01:27:02.782 - 01:27:03.243] Host: I don't know.
[01:27:04.103 - 01:27:07.587] Host: Last meal means I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:27:07.607 - 01:27:11.251] Host: But if I know I'm going to go, then maybe.
[01:27:11.611 - 01:27:12.692] Guest: Paranbhat and modak.

[01:27:28.467 - 01:27:34.797] Guest: It feels like I am amongst many other kids, dancing in the rain behind you.
[01:27:35.999 - 01:27:37.241] Guest: And it feels good.
[01:27:37.261 - 01:27:39.064] Guest: That's a Dil Toh Pagal Hai reference.

[01:28:15.269 - 01:28:23.903] Guest: I would encourage you to do more podcasts generally because your internal energy should come out in front of the world.
