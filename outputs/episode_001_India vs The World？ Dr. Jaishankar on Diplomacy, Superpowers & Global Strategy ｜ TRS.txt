what's your message to all the young virat kohlis watching this and young jemima rodricks is watching this who'll take the country further you know i'm so glad you used the second name i think when i watched the women's league like watching a new emerging kind of activity you know vikings would always invade with the women as well okay alright we need to be vikings no you notice i'm not disputing it so why are you doing this podcast you know i'm doing this podcast one because i like you that's right ladies and gentlemen this is doctor jaishankar the minister of external affairs on trs possibly the most requested episode we've had in the longest time because we've done so much geopolitical content and this legend has come up so much on the show that we just had to bring him on trs keep in mind this is a very short episode there was a time constraint because of schedules on that particular day so i couldn't podcast exactly the way i wanted to with doctor jaishankar but it's a beginning you're going to see an incredible episode of trs up ahead special thanks to mygov india for making this happen this is my mid twenties dream to talk to this man considering how much he's done for the country considering how he's rewritten the country's branding on a global stage this was a great icebreaker with the legend as i said earlier i was a little nervous to speak to the cabinet ministers but doctor jaishankar made me feel extremely comfortable that's his actual real life vibe if you're a young motivated indian and that's what this particular episode one with doctor jaishankar was about it was about the young the new and the motivated india i hope you enjoyed this particular episode i hope every single young indian watches this episode because to be honest jokes apart we're living through some intense times and we need to turn to people like doctor jaishankar for guidance about the future so i'm gonna let you slip into the episode it is a slightly shorter episode we will come back with a much longer one with doctor jaishankar but for now enjoy this legendary piece of trs doctor jaishankar the most requested podcast possibly that we ever had how how are you and why do you think that is oh i'm good been a busy few weeks but i would say probably people are more interested in foreign policy nowadays nowadays and maybe they're going to watch you you know so i mean geopolitics is one of those subjects that people have been lapping up only recently but lapping it up heavily and you're the poster boy for everything that's happening correct geopolitically for india okay that's good to know but you know i in a way it's it's natural look what do we do most of the time you get up in the morning first thing you do is reach out for your phone right mhmm and see what is it you missed when you're sleeping now what it's done is it has connected us completely to the world yeah and because of the phone and then you build everything around it once you start getting used to global content and global comparisons then you know what you eat what you read what you think everything becomes global you know we are i mean that's why they call it globalization okay simple question for you who is doctor s jaishankar the man like that people don't know i'll tell you why right now you're very popular on shorts and reels for your very aggressive comebacks and your very aggressive responses and in many ways i feel like virat kohli and yourself are the faces of young india in some ways this is a there's a slight age difference between us no but you're still you're still the guy young india is like cheering for when we see you up there talking to all these people from other countries we're like yep that's that's the response that they should get look you know i'm a trained diplomat whose general sop is you know keep it play it cool sort of don't make too many waves etcetera now partly i've transitioned into being a political face okay but even i would say the diplomatic side of me which is still very deep after all i've done it for forty five years maybe more now it's like this you know i'm very nice to people who are nice to me when i get pushed i think it's natural to push back and one of the things that has been happening a bit is in the last year year and a half people have been pushing us a bit you know so i feel i mean it's it's you you raised you brought up virat kohli's cricket analogy you know if you get a few bounces you you you want to you want to do something with it no hit that pull shot yeah yeah okay you know when you say the sentence when i get pushed in many ways your i get pushed is actually when india gets pushed and you are the personification of india on a global scale keeping that in mind i want to ask you why pm modi said that you have adbud thoughts no i i not he didn't exactly say adhbud i think he said andhroni andhroni okay look to be very frank we had got off a plane i was myself a little bit zonked getting off the plane and he was talking about just outside to a group of supporters and i guess i i didn't ask him after that okay i guess what he was really saying is look this guy has watched a lot of people come and go so he's seen a lot so maybe you should talk to him and ask him what you know what's different what's your age what's different yeah about you no i don't think it was so much what he was talking about me he was actually saying that look guys talk to him because he will tell you how much you know the prime minister's visits have changed how much foreign policy has changed how much the country has changed so it was more his it was my thoughts rather than me as a subject that he was talking about that's my my take off i think it's one and the same thing whatever okay i had ishan sharma on the show yesterday he's a cricketer okay and he spoke about how after a certain point because you've played so much cricket and you have so many experiences that you've had your pattern recognition improves some people would call pattern recognition intuition or the sixth sense mhmm i am a hundred percent sure that even on a geopolitical scale there is a role of your sixth sense absolutely i agree with you can you talk a little bit about this like a slightly higher level of pattern recognition or even go one level higher than that is there like a spiritual aspect i mean i use that word cautiously no look what happens is there is this is partly experience but it's partly also hard work any business you again we are using sports but i would use it in my own line of work you spend a lot of time reading other players understanding their game you know their play how does it work their mind games which they try on you so you try to see patterns in other people in other countries in other you know other foreign ministries etcetera just like you do in sports so in that sense there's something very it's a it's a competitive activity so if you're going up against a competitor and i am a very competitive person okay i mean when you ask me that bit i i absolutely let you know i mean i try to work out as much of it in sports but i still have a lot left over for my real business so when you when you if you are an accommodative person all the time your six senses you call it is working on your you know one part i'm listening to you but if you know i've seen you do this before we've talked before i've seen i've prepared by watching you or studying you before the sixth sense takes over so sometimes you know when you are in a situation people sometimes ask you saying oh did you think about that line before i didn't i mean that sixth sense takes over at that time because you already kind of you know it's moving faster than your mind and it's actually telling you okay this they're gonna hit you with this so you're already processing it so you'll you'll you'll see that coming at you before it actually comes at you so that's now i would say it's more like a instinct right you call it spirituality i wouldn't go that far but you know sure there you have it but you know i i just want to round off the earlier point you asked me what you know what did pm mean by that what has changed i think one part is we're really living under prime minister modi in a different era he has been in many ways personally transformational he's he's churned the system in a very very radical way i mean i you know i joined the government when another gujarati was a prime minister maharaj desai okay so that's how far back i go a lot of people you know your listeners would be wondering okay what the hell is even talking about no no you're still the poster boy of young india but but look it's not often you get people in any line of business leave alone in something like running a nation you can have the big thoughts you know the the strategic ideas the grand vision very seriously you have the the revolutionary concepts that you chart out okay there's a different way of looking at a problem that's one skill and then you have going down to the details saying okay this doesn't this needs to be tweaked that detail needs to be looked at this problem needs to be fixed guys you haven't done the backup on this usually there are talented people inspired people who get the big picture there are people who are very grounded who who kind of go down drill down it's very rare to find it in one person and that i would say to me is a very singular quality opera mister modi and that makes it very in a way very interesting to work with him but it makes it very challenging because he can challenge you right up there he can challenge you right down there you know and what's your current challenge look it's the world's a tough place right now you we barely come out of this covid thing you had this ukraine conflict and all the consequences which came out of it you know energy food inflation fertilizer if we had not handled it well we actually you know the indian consumer today the average person you and me it would have actually hit us in our pockets we would have seen much higher inflation we'd be paying much more for our oil than we are so i'm actually looking at the world when at a world where everything is coming at me at the same time you know there's a health issue coming at me there's an energy issue coming at me i have a set of border problems on the boundary border areas with the chinese i have the pending or you know the old problem with the pakistanis who you know have have been doing terrorism for so long and at the same time i'm growing you know my people are traveling abroad and for me one big part is how you know foreign policy is not a kind of a board game or an academic exercise it actually affects every person so in my own mind it's it's like how do i get this foreign policy for you you personally right you know how do i secure you when you travel how do i look after you when you get into problems how do i make sure if you're a student that you can work on the side and support yourself or that you know you don't have to wait for two and a half years for a visa by a foreign embassy so it's as i said i've also learned these are small things it's the big things you've got to get them both right the one truth i've learned about geopolitics is that it's money oriented if you have the money it helps you geopolitically second truth i've learned is that and this i've learned in the last three days speaking to the cabinet ministers is that the role of entrepreneurs is just do your own thing create employment increase the exports of the country help the country become richer would you like to give the youth and especially entrepreneurs any other geopolitical advice when it comes to this i don't want to use the phrase india versus china but this whole scenario how can we help no look i think you're smart not using that phrase india versus china for this reason yes we have issues with china but that's not the only issue i mean we have to be fundamentally competitive you know if i if i do not have the factories if i do not have the the as you say the entrepreneurship the businesses the start up the agriculture the infrastructure it's not just the the chinese the rest of the world will also run over me so you know it is at the end of the day there are roughly two hundred nations in the world okay okay maybe about a hundred and twenty five maybe much smaller okay after that once you start grading them there will be a zone okay there'll be a zone of countries who constantly compete with each other they could even be friends you know the us and europe are friends they compete like that okay so you'd have a europe you'd have an america russia china then you add you know maybe countries who are economically smaller than us but they would compete in certain fields yeah so i would say for example you have a vietnam vietnam is a much smaller economy but the fact is vietnam competes when it comes to certain kinds of investment so the bottom line i think what the young people need to know is that today it is all about building strengths that when you say make in india when you say start up india when you say gati shakti you know you need nobody's going to manufacture in india if your infrastructure is lousy okay so they need to see the you know the smart ports the good roads the rapid movement of goods if you have to do all this if you really need to create jobs to me at the end of the day it's all about creating jobs and opportunities there are many roads to it even foreign policy i would say especially foreign policy is one road which is our job is also to market india to brand india to to make india a magnet so that the rest of the world says okay these are responsible guys these are safe guys let's go and do business you know they're not gonna steal your stuff okay basically chase excellence create employment and as we move forward in this chase of individual excellence you will achieve national excellence in the sport of global i mean in the global sport of geopolitics well said when you meet one of our rival nation's foreign ministers like we saw you doing the namaste to bilal bhutto what is your interaction with him which the news doesn't capture which only podcast can potentially capture and what's your interaction like with say the chinese foreign minister if you meet him diplomacy is a is an art of detail in a way okay there's a lot of nuance you know body language how you dress what you say how you look how you hold your hands or don't hold your hands so all of all of this counts you it depends on the person it depends on the situation it depends you know the the partnership yes yes that also okay so you try to use you try to use it's a bit like a choreography so you you use that occasion to do the signaling i i could modulate it depending on that so it would it would depend on on the situation so there are times and occasions so i wouldn't say there's a single formula okay very raw question for you pardon me if i'm crossing a line no no no what's the most pissed off you've gotten at one of these meetings i'm sure something would have been said that just irritated you as a human being and what was your response and you don't need to name or you can name if you wish you know rarely by personal things because mostly i've learned to absorb it it it sort of i take it's par for the cause for me what happens is things do get under my skin and i i give you a recent example i've spoken about you know i was getting i was actually landed i forget from bangalore or something on a plane and i saw this picture of this guy climbing up the indian high commission in london and trying to pull down a flag absolutely it got under my skin so or if people you know they try and score points you know i i personal points i just shrug it i get apple but if if i feel in some way the collective eye in some way is demeaned or attacked or something yes you know that's when when i said when i get pushed okay i mean that that i as you rightly said is not me the i but i the india but that sense that somewhere if you're not given the respect or you're not you if your people are condescending sometimes people ambush you right okay and professionally when do you feel the most alive like when do you feel that you were born to do exactly this that's a feeling which kind of grew on me over a period of time part of it was you know i actually studied international relations which is not that usual for people in diplomats now i'm i'm only the second foreign minister who's actually been a diplomat natwar singh was the only other guy who'd been in that so in a sense you know my studies my my past long profession my current my current responsibility and even i had a brief break in business even that was international i was with the tata group and they gave me a kind of role in international business so i've been do in that sense that feeling that you're bound to do this frankly has grown a lot and in a way you know i also came from a household which was very international i live international i mean you know my family relationships are international i spend most of my time international so i guess it's sort of in you okay but at this stage of your life is there any moment occasionally you know i do give lifestyle advice to younger people rarely rarely mostly when they ask okay i i don't dispense otherwise i tell people look if you like if you really like doing something you'll be very good at it the problem with most of us is we end up doing things which are not necessarily what we want to do -it's what we're told to do -it's what we're told to do you know circumstances make you -sure okay so for me look i always liked reading about the world i liked listening to music of the world i liked eating global food sometimes consuming youtube podcasts so so so you know it's been a mix of all of that so that what you say we are bound to do it yeah sure i mean all of this gets into that yeah you you it's a it's a natural okay alright this is a question that comes from the engineer inside me are you following the ai revolution based on whatever is happening in the world i'm sure you are i mean that was just an intro to the question okay that's podcasting techniques let's talk a little bit about the role of ai i would love for you to also give an input on the role of quantum computing because it's come up in geopolitical conversations mhmm how do you look at it from your perspective the future of technology i don't know if you should watch this show called black mirror no i haven't okay it's about the technologies that are upcoming and you all know harari says that the stuff they've shown in black mirror is so realistic it's either already happening or it's going to happen in five to ten or it'll happen once you watch the show possibly because science fiction determines where science goes but do you follow whatever is happening in the world of engineering technology and how do you look at it affecting our country our foreign policy etc etc you know i'm not an engineer and i'll give you what i hope is like a common sense answer from my perspective and i'll take you back actually to your first question you asked me do i watch patterns okay sure i watch patterns that's how i do my business that's why i think i can be good at my business now just imagine i am humanly because i have limited capabilities as a human being i'm watching the patterns of two hundred people who i deal with every day imagine if i could process the patterns of two hundred million people that's the world which is you are talking about but with each one of us we are like a walking emitter of electronic patterns okay you know what you download what you say what you listen to what you buy what you eat you're creating i mean earlier on there would have been a pattern but you couldn't see it okay today that pattern is organized it has actually become a business it has become politics it has become strategy it is actually at the end of the day this this how do you sort of mega process patterns and that then gives you a fantastic edge so i mean imagine imagine a virat kohli who has at his fingertips everything about everybody's ever gonna be batting against man that's a dream world it's not be able to predict each delivery each strategy so maybe the way we should build out artificial intelligence as humans is we should develop an ai based assistant for you for you to be able to you know if that's don't worry it'll happen well is it already happening you never know okay how often do quantum computing conversations come up because it's come up on the show from a geopolitical perspective the first country that cracks it will right now actually if you ask me what's right on our plate it's much more semiconductors you know there's this whole chip war which is going on you can say a tech war which is going on so a lot of what we are doing today is about that and it's about how do you actually prepare a foreign era where you know sort of chips you can say is the new oil mhmm and in fact i you know i was a week ago in europe and thereafter with the pm in the quad in in japan and a big part of those conversations were really about how you know countries cooperate to ensure what we call trusted collaboration which is countries who have that faith in each other who have similar systems we use the word like minded you know these are normally market economies democracies sort of how you know people with companies who follow company ethics and rules like we know how do these countries really come together and create a kind of a supply chain now here's the bit which i think particularly your younger listeners should look at there was a time ten years ago maybe about seven or eight years ago even i used to go around telling people saying you know look you need to open up your economy more you know mobility there's indians who would be looking for opportunities to work because we really started especially under prime minister modi one thing keeps dinning into us you know think of the world as a global workplace okay this is one like regular message we get from him in every possible way as a global workplace in a global workplace that don't think you know your work opportunities could be anywhere now it's your job in foreign policy to open up those doors okay you know why should a talented indian be restricted okay now if you are gonna work everywhere and this does not mean rocket science okay i mean you have people working in merchant shipping and air cruise in blue collar jobs in professional jobs a chartered account any profession you take how do you actually give a full kind of space for indian talent to do its best now coming back to this i find because today we are moving into that tech competition or tech wars era there is a huge demand today for trusted talent for people who play by the rules who understand how the international business systems work skilled people talented people and these are the age groups we are looking at kind of below thirty five they are massively in demand in the world and we just came out of australia we did a mobility agreement the week before i signed one with austria austria you know is not a country which would immediately think of in terms of migration done it with germany with a number of european countries and even with the us you know prime minister is going to be going there next month a lot of it is look how do we create the flows now these kind of flows are gonna be very different it's you know it's like the world you are very familiar perhaps more than me your habits change people don't have to leave india anymore to work somewhere the global workplace doesn't mean you shift your place it just means your employer doesn't have to be in the same town or the same country or the service you render doesn't have to be there so that's the kind of world you know we are getting prepared for so for me if you look at the at the tech space the global workplace the mobility the semiconductor the what are called critical emerging technologies this is really what is sucking up the oxygen when i was growing up in the 2000s and early 2010s you'd often go for family functions where the families would encourage the kids to leave india and that used to piss me off when i was a kid why do you want to leave your country let's do something for the country maybe that's just the cricket fan in me talking but it led me in the right direction more than half of all the engineering students with main college left the country a lot of them wish to come back i want you to directly address those people who are on the fence about coming back how do we reverse this brain drain problem that's one part of the question to please address the parents who still want their kids to leave the country and please address the kids who want to leave the country for whatever reason you know i i i would put it i would define the issue differently from you sure if you define it as you know brain drain here's our country there is abroad why are you leaving you're making it a a kind of choice which you may not necessarily get the outcomes you want okay i put it to you very differently it's you know the world's like a kind of a membrane you can go in and out and actually that's what's gonna happen you know i see i you know i've actually encountered a lot of people who do a job go abroad do a job come back go again abroad the days when you said oh if i leave a foreign country and come back to india my you know oh my god maybe i'll never go back again now that's no longer the case so what you say you're sure maybe ten fifteen years ago that's the way the world was i think we need to today recognize that you know there was a time when you said a short term job is what is the employer's preference well a lot of people today would actually say okay let me take this but i'm not sure i'm gonna commit my entire life to this that's also happening so the job is changing the people are changing mobility is changing global economy is changing i think you're going to see a lot of this up and down you know movement and people will also realize in many industries that actually you will get an opportunity in india which may be better than an opportunity abroad yeah sure we have too many indian steve wozniaks sitting in america right now who studied gained experiences of working in tech there we have a lot of steve jobs in india who are looking for wozniaks to come back here and build the kind of companies that we're seeing built out in silicon valley so do you have anything to say about that is that correct thinking look i i i've been to silicon valley a few times i see changes even in silicon valley you know silicon valley today is much more interested in the valleys of india you know that's also happening so it's not like it's not like escape to silicon valley and guys now i found nirvana anymore anymore true true i i think you're seeing a a lot of people you know out there coming back you know after all look even all people out there when they now see i mean you take the example of apple okay you know you know why it's been an important event is it's had a very strong resonance at different levels it's had a resonance in manufacturing it's it's a it's a kind of validation of an improved business atmosphere it's also by the way a testament to the quality of people they find now this frankly this wouldn't have happened ten years ago so it's a it's a very good example look i can always tell anybody you know everything is much better ten years now you'll say okay show me the proof to me that's a proof you know when you actually have good global companies and the other interesting thing is when you have indian companies the big ones who are actually now saying you know maybe maybe i'm going to invest a bit more in india i don't need to necessarily hedge by going out so that too is a factor so things are happening okay why are you doing this podcast you know i'm doing this podcast one because i like you i but two i'm also doing it because i feel today you need to to get people to understand what what we are about what the government's about what the world is about and different people different people absorb differently okay you know there's still people i mean the beauty with india is you have twenty different mediums spread over two hundred years all of them are still working you know it's like having an old model that's also working and the latest gizmo is also working so today monkey bath also works okay newspapers also work but it's it's who you're talking to k so you know this is a different set of people i'm talking to a different generation of people i'm talking to i would love to believe that my podcast audience is the one that wants aggressive growth it's the virat khouris of the future of this country i hope so so considering that these are all extremely aggressive leaders one last question for you on this chat and i hope it's the first chat of many many more chats that we have eventually what's your message to all the young virat colleagues watching this and young jamima rodricks is watching this who'll take the country further you know i'm so glad you used the second name because i mean i i actually this year got really i mean it's something which i followed for some time but i i think when i watched the women's leak and i and i find that's something which is also really you know when you it's like watching a new emerging kind of activity but you know vikings would always invade with the women as well okay alright we need to be vikings now okay let's go on you'll notice i'm not disputing it but the the no look my message would be different data have self belief the kind of opportunities the possibilities of this era are very different i think today it is very important at one level you know i spoke about thinking big and thinking in kind of practical deep detail similarly i would say we need to look at the big choices we make the national choices we make we need to look at the personal choices we make they're not diverse from each other a good sound national choice actually widens your personal choices and i you know i look anybody with age wants to be younger okay it's a it's a natural feeling but truly for someone who's today say twenty there's a world waiting on them for to happen and and i i i think it's the obligation of people like us to to to sort of open that up as much to prepare it as much to create that kind of favorable ground and when i you know maybe the next chat we should do this actually you look at indian cricket and indian diplomacy i think there's a lot that they could learn from each other that could be a subject in itself wow okay so many more tangential questions just related to that thought one last question there's also a lot of youtubers and i would like to say extremely early thought leaders maybe we are because we do influence a large mass of people what's your message for them what role do we have for our country i i think the today you honestly don't have to be experienced which is another nice way of saying a little older too too too late you know leadership can come from a young person conversely you know there are there are people who who may be older who would relate to a young person precisely because they have that kind of confidence you know i i was i i was very struck i was reading something which p v sindhu had written and one of the points she made was how is it that narendra modi is today a youth icon you know why is he a youth icon it's a very interesting question it's worth thinking about so i think that's a good note to end this session so i i do look forward to another one at some stage i've given you an idea today but always open to your thoughts doctor jayjankar owner of my life that's all i will say thank you for everything you're doing the whole i is in the conversation we all know that secretly the youth is obsessed with geopolitics nowadays thank you sir means a lot looking forward to

gonna be a two hour conversation we're gonna go much deeper we're gonna cover many more topics i'm going to ask him a lot more questions that abhijit chawra rajeev malhotra abhijit iyer mitra have raised in my mind but that's for the next time for now i request you to share this episode as much as possible more cabinet minister interviews are coming up thanks to migo of india helping trs crack these conversations please give me your feedback ladies and gentlemen i wanna know what you thought of this conversation i wanna know what we can improve and i wanna know who else you'd like to see when it comes to this political phase of trs i always try bringing out the human side of the person and i hope that you enjoy these conversations as much as i enjoy creating them for you lots of love
