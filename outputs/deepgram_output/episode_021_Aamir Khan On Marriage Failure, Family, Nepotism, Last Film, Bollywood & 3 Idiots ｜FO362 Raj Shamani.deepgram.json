So maybe there's an advantage to it, but my consciously, I'm very curious as a person. I don't know. You wanted curiosity to remain. I understand. Maybe quality, but I'm saying need the person only this much to give you some understanding. Yeah. Your curiosity should not be satiated. I'll try. There's an experiment to be done. Let's see what works. There's a long way to go Yeah. Lunch But you you you know, you form a certain connect with the person. But you have to be strict not to ask those questions on the first day. So next time they will be cutting yourself. Yes. Topic. I'll do. That's what I would I'll experiment. One idea. Alex. Next time Actually, I'll be advised. Because there's always something to No. I agree with you. I also keep asking people what they feel about my work because a honest or candid answer say. Yeah. Experiment. Love. Sounds good.

And editing of film and direct editing.\n\nPrep shooting body wise. But actual editing. Work out. Editing editing editing I can't stop myself from that.

Sorry. 32, 34, 35 sets.\n\nNot reps.\n\nSpeaker 0: 35 sets.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sets. Only shoulder.\n\nSpeaker 0: And how many reps in one set? Eight, ten?\n\nSpeaker 1: Eight, ten, 12. Eight, ten, 12. We used to go twelve, ten, eight, twelve, 10, eight. But I should do 32, sometimes 35 sets.\n\nSpeaker 0: Of one exercise? Of of one body part\n\nSpeaker 1: of one muscle, different exercise. That's too much. Yeah. Shoulder is too small muscle you don't need. You just need maximum 12, you know, 12, 12 solid, sets is good to, you know, destroy the shoulder if you do it well.\n\nSpeaker 0: 32 sets. To overtraining. My team team we got a bit of variation market. That was problem\n\nSpeaker 1: sculpted, very muscular wrestler. Very well built, less fat. Training heavy. I was, you know, I was overloading style of training\n\nSpeaker 0: I know all of\n\nSpeaker 1: which means I was doing, first set six reps, failing at six reps, second set failing at four reps, and third set failing at two reps. That means I was lifting very heavy.\n\nSpeaker 0: One two max.\n\nSpeaker 1: Two ks, I cannot do third rep, failing at two. Body transformed. Which is fat cut. Muscle already. Yeah.\n\nCalorie count. You're on deficit calorie. Deficit calorie muscle. Uh-huh.

It fills you with joy.\n\nSpeaker 0: Here's the last question. Uh-huh. How can I do this better? I may advise based on you spent four hours, five hours with me now. Or Oh.\n\nBetter so that I become better in my work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Interview conscious decision manager observe manager observe free flowing or naturally follow conversation. Conversation or instinctively follow organic natural flow conversation quality quality. Look, questions answer. Answer same question answer So actually qualities advantage advantage advantage advantage advantage advantage advantage advantage advantage advantage interview actually Yeah. So that's the only thing I can suggest which is also not hard and fast because sometimes you'll want to know the guest, sometimes you'd rather not know the guest.\n\nBut otherwise I think you're doing really well.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're doing really well.

But I found you really good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. It means a lot that is coming from you. And may I going forward, I'll do experiment. I'll try that. Break break break or bond extra strong.\n\nLike, I could because just candidism I was more free. So maybe there's an advantage to it, but my consciously, I'm very curious as a person. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: You wanted curiosity to remain. I understand. Maybe quality, but I'm saying need the person only this much to give you some understanding. Yeah. Your curiosity should not be satiated.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll try. There's an experiment to be done. Let's see what works. There's a long way to go\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Lunch\n\nSpeaker 1: But you you you know, you form a certain connect with the person. But you have to be strict not to ask those questions on the first day.\n\nSpeaker 0: So next time they will be cutting yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Topic. I'll do. That's what I would\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll experiment. One idea. Alex. Next time Actually,\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll\n\nSpeaker 0: be advised. Because there's always something\n\nSpeaker 1: to No. I agree with you. I also keep asking people what they feel about my work because a honest or candid answer say. Yeah.
