[00:03:49.995 - 00:03:50.575] Speaker 2: a positivity,
[00:03:51.115 - 00:03:51.855] Speaker 2: you know,

[00:07:42.190 - 00:07:42.690] Speaker 1: bouquet.
[00:07:45.230 - 00:07:46.770] Speaker 1: Like, I feel it's a very cliched
[00:07:47.470 - 00:07:49.330] Speaker 1: thing to give someone a bouquet.
[00:07:50.910 - 00:07:53.625] Speaker 2: Is not well thought out. You took the easiest way out.
[00:07:54.985 - 00:07:55.885] Speaker 1: But what generic

[00:08:04.825 - 00:08:07.950] Speaker 1: But please don't look at it as a bouquet. Just look at it as flowers.

[00:11:36.995 - 00:11:39.655] Speaker 2: They were six and eight when we moved here. Okay. Or
[00:11:44.770 - 00:11:45.990] Speaker 2: realized who I am.
[00:11:47.890 - 00:11:48.790] Speaker 2: You're so lucky.
[00:11:49.890 - 00:11:51.590] Speaker 2: Because your your mother is very
[00:11:51.970 - 00:11:52.470] Speaker 2: lucky.
[00:11:54.690 - 00:11:56.950] Speaker 2: So he said, but mom, you're you're a mom.

[00:12:03.465 - 00:12:04.605] Speaker 2: There's a incidence.
[00:12:05.065 - 00:12:08.845] Speaker 2: But now, I mean, I think they have seen more of my films after they went to college
[00:12:09.225 - 00:12:10.365] Speaker 2: because of their friends.
[00:12:11.440 - 00:12:13.060] Speaker 2: But Indian friends
[00:12:14.080 - 00:12:16.260] Speaker 2: they've seen more movies of mine than they have
[00:12:16.560 - 00:12:21.140] Speaker 1: their entire life. If I was Madhuri Dixit, I would show all my filmography to my kids.
[00:12:21.840 - 00:12:23.380] Speaker 1: But I'm not Madhuri Dixit.
[00:12:23.840 - 00:12:26.500] Speaker 2: I think if you are Madhuri Dixit, you had kids you would not have.
[00:12:29.785 - 00:12:30.605] Speaker 2: Have you seen?
[00:12:32.105 - 00:12:34.925] Speaker 2: He's seen it recently. My older guy has seen it recently.

[00:12:45.790 - 00:12:55.435] Speaker 2: Because either they used to be watching cartoons or superhero movies. Right? They didn't and they didn't understand Hindi. Yeah. After they moved here, Abhi, now they just started talking in,
[00:12:55.855 - 00:12:57.875] Speaker 2: Marathi and Hindi and all that.
[00:13:00.415 - 00:13:01.395] Speaker 1: There are some people,
[00:13:02.495 - 00:13:06.355] Speaker 1: who have visualized being on the show a lot. Mhmm. So you're definitely
[00:13:07.110 - 00:13:10.890] Speaker 1: in that category. Okay. It's also an outcome of life because I feel
[00:13:12.150 - 00:13:14.570] Speaker 1: art and art is often an outcome of childhood. Mhmm.
[00:13:18.550 - 00:13:23.665] Speaker 1: I'm sure you're used to these kind of things from people that, oh, we love you. It's always great to know that

[00:18:32.625 - 00:18:33.285] Speaker 1: Like, for example,
[00:18:33.665 - 00:18:35.685] Speaker 1: nineties behind the scenes

[00:37:18.100 - 00:37:20.120] Speaker 2: or, of course, if there's love around you,
[00:37:21.140 - 00:37:25.295] Speaker 2: you know. So these three things are the most important thing for me. But
[00:37:28.715 - 00:37:29.695] Speaker 1: House full of love
[00:37:30.875 - 00:37:33.295] Speaker 2: House full of love. You know?

[00:37:51.495 - 00:37:53.995] Speaker 2: It'll always be a challenge, you know.
[00:37:56.615 - 00:37:58.075] Speaker 2: You have to be a little giving

[00:38:18.905 - 00:38:22.205] Speaker 2: you should be able to play any part, I feel. Or

[01:00:13.270 - 01:00:13.770] Speaker 2: Or
[01:00:15.590 - 01:00:17.850] Speaker 2: it's very important to keep you calm,
[01:00:18.710 - 01:00:20.330] Speaker 2: to keep your wits around you.
[01:00:25.435 - 01:00:27.215] Speaker 2: Or live every day.
[01:00:28.075 - 01:00:29.055] Speaker 2: You know, don't think
[01:00:30.875 - 01:00:37.470] Speaker 2: ahead because you psych yourself when you do that. So live every day and try to do make the right choices and try to do your best.
[01:00:44.750 - 01:00:46.610] Speaker 2: You know? If you
[01:00:47.470 - 01:00:49.090] Speaker 2: approach it and
[01:00:50.765 - 01:00:52.465] Speaker 2: head on. You know?
[01:00:55.885 - 01:00:59.025] Speaker 1: Like, that's how my whole career has been built. It's not going to be a
[01:00:59.965 - 01:01:01.345] Speaker 1: weird question. Right?
[01:01:02.125 - 01:01:02.865] Speaker 1: Don't worry.
[01:01:03.360 - 01:01:04.340] Speaker 1: But I notice
[01:01:04.880 - 01:01:05.380] Speaker 1: personalities.
[01:01:07.840 - 01:01:13.780] Speaker 1: Many of them now understand what a podcast is, but everyone comes into podcast expecting a journalistic interview.
[01:01:14.880 - 01:01:15.380] Speaker 1: Headlines.
[01:01:16.080 - 01:01:22.165] Speaker 2: Because we are used to that. No? Questions and answers like that. Like questions about your career, your life. Yeah. Or,
[01:01:23.685 - 01:01:24.185] Speaker 2: format.
[01:01:25.285 - 01:01:25.785] Speaker 1: Yeah.
[01:01:27.445 - 01:01:30.185] Speaker 1: Yeah. I also think it's the exact reason why,
[01:01:30.885 - 01:01:32.025] Speaker 1: journalistic interviews
[01:01:32.520 - 01:01:34.060] Speaker 1: do not get traction anymore.
[01:01:38.280 - 01:01:39.100] Speaker 1: Element of disrespect
[01:01:39.640 - 01:01:40.140] Speaker 1: questions.
[01:01:40.680 - 01:01:45.735] Speaker 1: You know, I can I can ask so many more questions to all my guests, but I don't out of
[01:01:46.215 - 01:01:48.635] Speaker 1: the fact that when I'm dying, I don't want them
[01:01:49.335 - 01:01:50.955] Speaker 1: to hold that against me?
[01:01:51.495 - 01:01:52.715] Speaker 1: I on my death bed,
[01:01:53.015 - 01:01:54.075] Speaker 1: you know, and I feel
[01:01:55.015 - 01:01:55.515] Speaker 1: negative
[01:01:56.855 - 01:01:59.530] Speaker 1: when you throw disrespect on people. Right. Right.
[01:02:00.190 - 01:02:03.130] Speaker 2: I don't know. Everybody's worked hard to be where they are. Yes.
[01:02:03.510 - 01:02:06.410] Speaker 2: Or everybody has been through a lot in their own lives.
[01:02:06.710 - 01:02:07.770] Speaker 2: They don't need that.
[01:02:09.030 - 01:02:13.605] Speaker 1: I usually ask questions on behalf of people. The things I think can heal the world.
[01:02:15.365 - 01:02:18.345] Speaker 1: I feel the age of fifties or sixties age bracket.
[01:02:18.645 - 01:02:22.905] Speaker 1: And I see my mom also going through these things. I see my mommy, my. Mhmm.
[01:02:24.565 - 01:02:26.505] Speaker 1: Mental health up and down women
[01:02:26.965 - 01:02:29.465] Speaker 1: partly because of menopause, partly because of life.
[01:02:30.460 - 01:02:31.440] Speaker 1: Empty nest syndrome.
[01:02:32.620 - 01:02:35.120] Speaker 2: Because your kids are no longer there so you feel like
[01:02:35.420 - 01:02:37.040] Speaker 2: a vacuum in your life.
[01:02:37.340 - 01:02:38.720] Speaker 2: So in your age group,
[01:02:41.100 - 01:02:46.215] Speaker 1: how do women help each other and how can we help each other through the screen? How can we have the women watching this?
[01:02:46.835 - 01:02:48.455] Speaker 2: Well, I'll say that, you know,
[01:02:49.475 - 01:02:50.135] Speaker 2: I know
[01:02:55.235 - 01:02:56.375] Speaker 2: life Everything is
[01:02:56.755 - 01:02:58.790] Speaker 2: orbiting around them. Or
[01:03:01.570 - 01:03:04.070] Speaker 2: they cook they fly the nest, basically. They,
[01:03:05.090 - 01:03:06.710] Speaker 2: they they're doing their own thing.
[01:03:14.505 - 01:03:15.245] Speaker 2: Mom phone
[01:03:15.625 - 01:03:16.765] Speaker 2: call Can I call you later?
[01:03:18.345 - 01:03:22.925] Speaker 2: Suddenly, they feel a vacuum around them. They feel like, oh my god. Just now
[01:03:26.665 - 01:03:27.805] Speaker 2: life suddenly
[01:03:29.450 - 01:03:35.150] Speaker 2: it's gone. You know? Now he's she's on her own. Of course, her husband is there. I'm not talking about that. But I'm saying personally,
[01:03:36.170 - 01:03:36.670] Speaker 2: emotion.
[01:03:40.810 - 01:03:43.470] Speaker 2: It's very important to take up something that you love
[01:03:43.770 - 01:03:44.145] Speaker 2: at
[01:03:44.945 - 01:03:46.805] Speaker 2: that point. Something that you're passionate about
[01:03:47.185 - 01:03:50.085] Speaker 2: and start doing that. It could be the stupidest thing.
[01:03:56.545 - 01:03:58.280] Speaker 2: You like to walk, start
[01:03:58.740 - 01:04:05.960] Speaker 2: walking. You like to knit or you like some sort of art, start doing it. You know? Start occupying your time
[01:04:06.420 - 01:04:14.355] Speaker 2: and start doing something that you have loved all your life or not got actually an opportunity to do it because you had other things to do. Right?
[01:04:19.615 - 01:04:21.155] Speaker 2: Chance Take those hobbies
[01:04:21.535 - 01:04:24.755] Speaker 2: and start doing them. You know? Invest yourself in those.
[01:04:25.695 - 01:04:27.235] Speaker 2: So what happens is
[01:04:28.550 - 01:04:29.610] Speaker 2: something that interests
[01:04:30.790 - 01:04:31.290] Speaker 2: you
[01:04:34.710 - 01:04:35.210] Speaker 2: messages
[01:04:38.710 - 01:04:44.605] Speaker 2: answer You have to get over that because they're also busy. Up in the college, they they always don't get time to call you.
[01:04:45.545 - 01:04:46.765] Speaker 2: So start doing that.
[01:04:47.225 - 01:04:53.245] Speaker 2: Start doing something that you were passionate about or are or want to take up and start learning something,
[01:04:53.865 - 01:04:55.325] Speaker 2: you know. To a
[01:04:56.425 - 01:04:57.600] Speaker 2: up life banana.
[01:04:58.780 - 01:05:02.000] Speaker 1: Yeah. You know what? I feel I'm in that position of the child of
[01:05:02.380 - 01:05:05.740] Speaker 1: a mom who's just in her sixties right now. Mhmm.
[01:05:06.700 - 01:05:09.840] Speaker 1: I feel I'm not talking for just myself but maybe poor generation
[01:05:11.595 - 01:05:13.215] Speaker 1: mental health problems. Anxiety
[01:05:15.515 - 01:05:16.015] Speaker 1: anxiety.
[01:05:18.875 - 01:05:20.255] Speaker 1: And in the middle of all that
[01:05:24.870 - 01:05:25.370] Speaker 1: loneliness
[01:05:25.750 - 01:05:26.250] Speaker 1: solitude.
[01:05:28.310 - 01:05:30.410] Speaker 1: But you still love your mom and your dad.
[01:05:31.750 - 01:05:40.475] Speaker 1: So, I feel too many people either navigating that right now. It's very tricky times even. It's tricky for the kids also, and it's tricky for the parents also.
[01:05:41.415 - 01:05:41.915] Speaker 2: College
[01:05:47.495 - 01:05:47.995] Speaker 2: college
[01:05:48.390 - 01:05:48.890] Speaker 2: they
[01:05:49.350 - 01:05:50.810] Speaker 2: go out of station to,
[01:05:51.190 - 01:05:52.010] Speaker 2: some other place
[01:05:52.470 - 01:05:53.690] Speaker 2: to for the education
[01:05:56.630 - 01:05:57.110] Speaker 2: or,
[01:05:58.310 - 01:06:00.010] Speaker 2: because they are so busy reply
[01:06:00.825 - 01:06:01.325] Speaker 2: They're
[01:06:03.785 - 01:06:04.925] Speaker 2: relying on their friends
[01:06:05.305 - 01:06:06.125] Speaker 2: for the support
[01:06:08.025 - 01:06:08.525] Speaker 2: or
[01:06:10.425 - 01:06:10.925] Speaker 2: friends
[01:06:12.825 - 01:06:17.020] Speaker 2: Everybody has to go through this. And I think that's when the children also learn.
[01:06:22.920 - 01:06:24.140] Speaker 2: I I values
[01:06:26.840 - 01:06:28.425] Speaker 2: respect everybody. Do this.
[01:06:29.145 - 01:06:30.845] Speaker 2: Do the right thing in any situation.
[01:06:32.505 - 01:06:33.165] Speaker 2: You know,
[01:06:36.505 - 01:06:38.765] Speaker 2: So trust them that once they are there,
[01:06:44.550 - 01:06:45.050] Speaker 2: You
[01:06:45.430 - 01:06:46.570] Speaker 2: know? Trust
[01:06:47.030 - 01:06:47.850] Speaker 2: You know,
[01:06:50.870 - 01:06:53.690] Speaker 2: because they're also discovering life. For the first time
[01:06:54.390 - 01:06:54.890] Speaker 2: alone
[01:07:00.035 - 01:07:00.855] Speaker 2: wrong decisions
[01:07:02.755 - 01:07:03.255] Speaker 2: support
[01:07:04.515 - 01:07:06.935] Speaker 2: or make sure that they go through those rough times
[01:07:07.475 - 01:07:08.455] Speaker 2: and come back
[01:07:10.195 - 01:07:10.695] Speaker 2: or.
[01:07:11.155 - 01:07:12.935] Speaker 1: Please correct me if I'm wrong. Okay?
[01:07:15.360 - 01:07:16.020] Speaker 1: Romantic relationship
[01:07:17.760 - 01:07:18.740] Speaker 1: communication skills
[01:07:22.800 - 01:07:23.300] Speaker 1: communicate
[01:07:32.445 - 01:07:33.905] Speaker 2: communicate Yeah. It's very important.
[01:07:34.205 - 01:07:34.705] Speaker 2: Right?
[01:07:35.085 - 01:07:36.225] Speaker 2: Communication line
[01:07:37.005 - 01:07:37.985] Speaker 2: has to be open.
[01:07:38.685 - 01:07:39.185] Speaker 2: Sites.
[01:07:39.485 - 01:07:39.985] Speaker 2: Sites.
[01:07:40.685 - 01:07:41.745] Speaker 2: It has to be open.
[01:07:45.470 - 01:07:49.570] Speaker 2: It takes time. It cannot happen all of a sudden. I also feel that
[01:07:51.150 - 01:07:53.970] Speaker 1: you kind of have to take the role of a parent in some capacities
[01:07:54.830 - 01:08:00.575] Speaker 2: and just be more understanding in those situations. Yes. Like, I always say that our generation is sandwich generation.
[01:08:02.075 - 01:08:02.575] Speaker 2: Parents
[01:08:04.955 - 01:08:06.975] Speaker 2: So we are taking care of both sides
[01:08:07.435 - 01:08:09.775] Speaker 2: because your parents have also become like kids.
[01:08:14.060 - 01:08:15.680] Speaker 2: Parents type by
[01:08:16.220 - 01:08:18.080] Speaker 2: you know, because they're also getting older.
[01:08:18.540 - 01:08:19.440] Speaker 2: They have their ways.
[01:08:21.380 - 01:08:22.160] Speaker 2: Ways may.
[01:08:23.900 - 01:08:29.225] Speaker 2: Change you know? So you have to take care of them and you have to take care of your kids. So I call them the sandwich,
[01:08:30.745 - 01:08:33.565] Speaker 1: generation. It's almost the challenge of life at that stage.
[01:08:34.425 - 01:08:36.765] Speaker 2: Yeah. But, I mean, what's life without challenges?
[01:08:37.625 - 01:08:38.765] Speaker 2: Mhmm. Challenges
[01:08:41.860 - 01:08:42.740] Speaker 2: That's the most,
[01:08:43.460 - 01:08:47.000] Speaker 1: interesting thing to me. It's all about attitude towards
[01:08:48.100 - 01:08:49.960] Speaker 1: navigating with grace. Yes.
[01:08:51.380 - 01:08:51.880] Speaker 1: Challenge
[01:08:53.140 - 01:08:57.675] Speaker 2: Yeah. I love to yeah. Navigating it with grace, you put it very, very, very nicely.
[01:08:59.595 - 01:09:02.255] Speaker 2: Nicely. You have to give in a lot sometimes.
[01:09:03.675 - 01:09:04.175] Speaker 2: Give
[01:09:05.915 - 01:09:09.375] Speaker 2: Like, to your parents, you have to give a lot because you got a lot from them.
[01:09:11.035 - 01:09:11.535] Speaker 2: Parents
[01:09:11.880 - 01:09:12.380] Speaker 2: So
[01:09:12.760 - 01:09:18.540] Speaker 2: you have to give it on this side and on this side because they are your responsibilities. So you're giving on this side. So
[01:09:19.320 - 01:09:21.500] Speaker 2: it's it's very hard. It's a very hard,
[01:09:22.120 - 01:09:23.180] Speaker 2: time, but I think
[01:09:24.520 - 01:09:26.060] Speaker 2: generation. I think we are
[01:09:29.695 - 01:09:31.555] Speaker 2: you know? We have been through a lot.
[01:09:32.655 - 01:09:33.715] Speaker 2: We came from nothing.
[01:09:34.975 - 01:09:35.475] Speaker 2: Hassle
[01:09:36.255 - 01:09:37.075] Speaker 2: with our lives.
[01:09:37.695 - 01:09:38.095] Speaker 2: Or,
[01:09:38.895 - 01:09:41.235] Speaker 2: so we are we are warriors, basically.
[01:09:41.695 - 01:09:42.835] Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. And
[01:09:43.950 - 01:09:45.810] Speaker 2: we see it through. We see everything
[01:09:46.110 - 01:09:46.610] Speaker 2: through.
[01:09:47.710 - 01:09:48.290] Speaker 2: Mhmm. Pre
[01:09:48.830 - 01:09:50.050] Speaker 1: liberalization India,
[01:09:51.710 - 01:09:53.810] Speaker 1: eighty, seventy, sixties. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:09:56.435 - 01:09:59.415] Speaker 1: At your stage of life, your parent child relationship,
[01:10:00.515 - 01:10:02.535] Speaker 1: what does it feel like to see your parents
[01:10:03.155 - 01:10:08.295] Speaker 1: sorry to put it that way, but, like, I'm asking for perspective from my generation also. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:10:08.770 - 01:10:09.430] Speaker 2: I think,
[01:10:10.610 - 01:10:12.550] Speaker 2: sometimes it's very sad. Sometimes,
[01:10:14.770 - 01:10:15.830] Speaker 2: like, to see someone
[01:10:16.530 - 01:10:17.430] Speaker 2: lose their,
[01:10:18.130 - 01:10:19.350] Speaker 2: faculties. Yeah.
[01:10:22.905 - 01:10:25.165] Speaker 2: But they start repeating things, you know,
[01:10:25.625 - 01:10:26.125] Speaker 2: or
[01:10:27.625 - 01:10:30.525] Speaker 2: and then you are like, oh my god. I mean, it my
[01:10:30.985 - 01:10:33.645] Speaker 2: she was so intelligent or he was so intelligent or,
[01:10:34.425 - 01:10:35.965] Speaker 2: you know, she she cannot remember
[01:10:39.760 - 01:10:42.500] Speaker 2: So they they start losing those kind of things.
[01:10:43.200 - 01:10:43.520] Speaker 2: Or,
[01:10:44.240 - 01:10:47.140] Speaker 2: you just have to remind them. You have to be patient.
[01:10:47.520 - 01:10:48.020] Speaker 2: Patients
[01:10:50.000 - 01:10:50.480] Speaker 2: or,
[01:10:51.680 - 01:10:52.260] Speaker 2: I think
[01:10:52.575 - 01:10:55.315] Speaker 2: that that's the that's the most,
[01:10:56.335 - 01:10:56.835] Speaker 2: like,
[01:10:59.215 - 01:11:00.035] Speaker 2: you know, cheese
[01:11:00.495 - 01:11:04.355] Speaker 2: to see your parents, like because you have always idolized them
[01:11:04.940 - 01:11:13.680] Speaker 2: for being, like, the smartest, for being the best, for doing everything for and today you see them not having that kind of faculty anymore.
[01:11:14.300 - 01:11:14.800] Speaker 2: Though,
[01:11:15.100 - 01:11:19.040] Speaker 2: which is, it's very hard to see your parents. Does it change
[01:11:19.525 - 01:11:21.705] Speaker 1: your own perspective on your own life
[01:11:22.005 - 01:11:27.865] Speaker 2: seeing that? Well, I mean, when you see your parents and you see them and you think of your own mortality, obviously,
[01:11:28.565 - 01:11:30.745] Speaker 2: you know, you think about that too.
[01:11:31.285 - 01:11:34.105] Speaker 2: My mom's going through this. Will I be going through this as well?
[01:11:35.180 - 01:11:35.680] Speaker 2: Of
[01:11:35.980 - 01:11:37.280] Speaker 2: course, you think about it.
[01:11:37.580 - 01:11:38.080] Speaker 1: I
[01:11:41.500 - 01:11:43.280] Speaker 1: think it's an important life question.
[01:11:45.750 - 01:11:46.250] Speaker 1: Yeah.
[01:11:46.825 - 01:11:50.045] Speaker 1: In a almost in a romantic way, but not in a morbid way.
[01:11:51.225 - 01:11:51.725] Speaker 1: Mhmm.
[01:11:52.745 - 01:11:53.245] Speaker 1: But,
[01:11:55.545 - 01:11:56.685] Speaker 1: I think at least
[01:11:57.625 - 01:11:58.125] Speaker 1: culture
[01:11:59.390 - 01:12:01.010] Speaker 1: if you really study the shastras,
[01:12:01.390 - 01:12:05.410] Speaker 1: it says that just be peaceful about that and work towards being peaceful.
[01:12:10.350 - 01:12:13.125] Speaker 1: Death is the exam and life is your preparation time.
[01:12:14.245 - 01:12:15.465] Speaker 1: That's a very nice peaceful
[01:12:16.405 - 01:12:17.865] Speaker 1: way of looking at death.
[01:12:18.245 - 01:12:18.725] Speaker 1: But,
[01:12:20.245 - 01:12:21.625] Speaker 1: I spoke to an actor
[01:12:22.805 - 01:12:23.865] Speaker 1: roughly, like,
[01:12:24.245 - 01:12:24.745] Speaker 1: you
[01:12:25.125 - 01:12:27.945] Speaker 1: know, thirty years older than me, twenty five, thirty years older.
[01:12:31.110 - 01:12:33.690] Speaker 1: And then on that podcast, we debated for twenty minutes.
[01:12:34.230 - 01:12:36.170] Speaker 1: But I guess everyone has their own
[01:12:36.790 - 01:12:39.530] Speaker 1: pace of understanding this problem. But
[01:12:41.030 - 01:12:41.530] Speaker 1: cheese
[01:12:41.845 - 01:12:42.585] Speaker 1: to understand mortality.
[01:12:43.605 - 01:12:51.305] Speaker 1: I would love to hear your opinion on it. Like or if you think I'm just thinking two d or debate, that's fine. No. I think it's an eventuality.
[01:12:51.685 - 01:12:54.025] Speaker 2: Everybody has to go through it. Right?
[01:12:54.950 - 01:12:55.350] Speaker 2: Or,
[01:12:56.150 - 01:13:01.770] Speaker 2: I don't think about it so much. You know? It has to happen. It'll happen. It'll happen whenever it has to happen.
[01:13:02.150 - 01:13:05.770] Speaker 2: And that's that's something beyond your control. You cannot control that.
[01:13:06.230 - 01:13:06.890] Speaker 2: You have,
[01:13:07.955 - 01:13:10.215] Speaker 2: first of all, no idea. You have,
[01:13:14.835 - 01:13:16.775] Speaker 2: no power over it.
[01:13:17.075 - 01:13:18.055] Speaker 2: Right? Control
[01:13:20.275 - 01:13:20.775] Speaker 2: power.
[01:13:21.800 - 01:13:22.300] Speaker 2: It's,
[01:13:23.080 - 01:13:26.620] Speaker 2: it it will happen when it has to happen. So why think so much about it?
[01:13:27.320 - 01:13:35.775] Speaker 1: You know? Would you ever use mortality and death as a source to learn darkness for something like missus Deshpande to channelize those emotions there?
[01:13:38.095 - 01:13:39.475] Speaker 2: What do you mean by that?
[01:13:39.935 - 01:13:40.835] Speaker 1: Missus Deshpande,
[01:13:45.775 - 01:13:46.915] Speaker 2: darkness. I think badness
[01:13:47.455 - 01:13:48.835] Speaker 2: in a person like Evil?
[01:13:49.145 - 01:13:50.400] Speaker 2: Evil, you know.
[01:13:50.860 - 01:13:53.120] Speaker 1: And your job is to stay away from it.
[01:13:53.500 - 01:13:55.760] Speaker 1: Protect yourself and stay away from it.
[01:13:56.060 - 01:13:57.040] Speaker 2: Not for Deshpande.
[01:13:59.020 - 01:13:59.600] Speaker 1: Watch analyze.
[01:14:02.780 - 01:14:03.440] Speaker 2: Thank you.
[01:15:01.515 - 01:15:02.015] Speaker 2: Kinda
[01:15:02.395 - 01:15:04.575] Speaker 2: scared right now. Missus Deshpande.
[01:15:06.315 - 01:15:09.215] Speaker 2: I think but she's not all evil. I can tell you that.
[01:15:10.555 - 01:15:11.055] Speaker 2: Her,
[01:15:13.595 - 01:15:14.095] Speaker 2: history
[01:15:15.330 - 01:15:21.110] Speaker 2: the way she thinks is not is not completely evil. She's not an evil person. It's layered.
[01:15:21.490 - 01:15:27.670] Speaker 2: It's layered. It's much layered. It's all experiences, her life experiences, whatever she's gone through. And
[01:15:29.170 - 01:15:29.750] Speaker 2: I think
[01:15:32.455 - 01:15:32.955] Speaker 2: calmness
[01:15:35.175 - 01:15:35.675] Speaker 1: She's
[01:15:37.895 - 01:15:38.635] Speaker 2: very calm.
[01:15:41.335 - 01:15:42.795] Speaker 2: She's not trustworthy. She's
[01:15:43.110 - 01:15:45.690] Speaker 2: she's working with the police, but you can never trust her.
[01:15:50.310 - 01:15:52.490] Speaker 2: Thoughts Or she has her own angle on everything.
[01:15:54.390 - 01:15:57.755] Speaker 2: So even when the police is working with her, they're doing it because we're
[01:15:58.135 - 01:15:58.635] Speaker 2: desperate.
[01:16:00.535 - 01:16:01.195] Speaker 2: They need
[01:16:02.255 - 01:16:02.755] Speaker 2: her,
[01:16:03.815 - 01:16:04.315] Speaker 2: you
[01:16:05.375 - 01:16:05.875] Speaker 2: know.
[01:16:06.935 - 01:16:08.875] Speaker 2: What she's gonna do when and what
[01:16:09.335 - 01:16:09.815] Speaker 2: she can
[01:16:10.455 - 01:16:10.955] Speaker 2: she's
[01:16:11.335 - 01:16:15.460] Speaker 2: she's capable of a lot more. I feel like you enjoyed yourself a
[01:16:15.920 - 01:16:16.420] Speaker 2: lot
[01:16:16.880 - 01:16:17.460] Speaker 2: playing this
[01:16:17.920 - 01:16:27.300] Speaker 2: cast. You you had a lot of fun. Because, you know, it's always been, like, oh, goody goody, so sweet, you know, those kind of characters that I have played so far. Uh-huh. And I thought this
[01:16:27.995 - 01:16:28.875] Speaker 2: has so much,
[01:16:30.955 - 01:16:35.855] Speaker 2: in her. Like, she it's an onion, you know, you peel and you peel layers and you peel layers. Or,
[01:16:37.755 - 01:16:43.600] Speaker 2: it's just very well written. And Nagesh, of course, is a fantastic director. I'm working with him for the first time.
[01:16:48.700 - 01:16:50.960] Speaker 2: He he's very true to the script.
[01:16:53.660 - 01:16:54.320] Speaker 2: I know
[01:16:57.795 - 01:16:58.295] Speaker 2: focus
[01:16:58.675 - 01:16:59.415] Speaker 2: on the characters.
[01:17:01.635 - 01:17:02.775] Speaker 2: Character. You know? And
[01:17:03.235 - 01:17:04.455] Speaker 2: we needed that precision
[01:17:04.915 - 01:17:05.735] Speaker 2: for the script.
[01:17:06.435 - 01:17:11.415] Speaker 2: Or, that's why I said yes because applause is also producing it. They're also very good producers.
[01:17:12.310 - 01:17:15.370] Speaker 2: Nagesh is a fantastic director, and the script is so different
[01:17:15.750 - 01:17:16.650] Speaker 2: that I needed
[01:17:17.030 - 01:17:20.330] Speaker 2: these kind of people to back it, you know, when I'm there in the film.
[01:17:20.790 - 01:17:21.190] Speaker 2: So,
[01:17:21.670 - 01:17:24.170] Speaker 2: so let's see. We'll see. I hope

[01:23:08.155 - 01:23:13.855] Speaker 2: Ram was also feeling that, you know, I think you have done a podcast with him also to this effect.
[01:23:16.010 - 01:23:16.830] Speaker 2: Patients are
[01:23:17.130 - 01:23:18.110] Speaker 2: in a dire state
[01:23:19.450 - 01:23:21.390] Speaker 2: because they have to be operated on.
[01:23:23.130 - 01:23:26.990] Speaker 2: He has to operate on them. He says, why can't I catch them earlier on?
[01:23:31.325 - 01:23:32.305] Speaker 2: Patients go,
[01:23:33.005 - 01:23:33.505] Speaker 2: advice.
[01:23:34.285 - 01:23:38.625] Speaker 2: So I think that'll be a better thing than them getting into trouble and then coming to me
[01:23:39.085 - 01:23:39.985] Speaker 2: to get operated.
[01:23:40.530 - 01:23:45.670] Speaker 2: So he wanted to develop something in technology using technology, smart services, and,
[01:23:47.410 - 01:23:49.750] Speaker 2: AI and everything and create a system,
[01:23:51.410 - 01:23:53.670] Speaker 2: to make people healthy, you know,
[01:23:54.745 - 01:23:56.805] Speaker 2: look after their wellness.
[01:23:57.505 - 01:23:58.005] Speaker 2: And,
[01:23:58.625 - 01:24:00.405] Speaker 2: so that's what he wanted to do too.
[01:24:02.705 - 01:24:06.085] Speaker 2: Maybe it's a calling where, you know, everything is coming together.
[01:24:06.705 - 01:24:07.205] Speaker 2: And,
[01:24:07.745 - 01:24:09.205] Speaker 2: maybe if we move to India,
[01:24:09.650 - 01:24:12.470] Speaker 2: then we can, you know, start,
[01:24:13.303 - 01:24:16.450] Speaker 2: And he also wanted a a change. And so I
[01:24:17.330 - 01:24:23.910] Speaker 2: we thought it was a great then point for me to move here for us, all of us to move here together.
[01:24:27.465 - 01:24:29.005] Speaker 2: Of course, I missed India there.
[01:24:29.545 - 01:24:30.045] Speaker 2: Friends
[01:24:31.465 - 01:24:33.085] Speaker 2: All my friends were here.
[01:24:34.185 - 01:24:36.125] Speaker 2: Some of my family is here or,
[01:24:37.545 - 01:24:39.005] Speaker 2: so, yes, I used to miss India.
[01:24:42.530 - 01:24:44.790] Speaker 2: I used to try to make stuff there also.
[01:24:46.610 - 01:24:47.430] Speaker 1: I don't cook.
[01:24:47.970 - 01:24:52.150] Speaker 2: I am an okay cook. I'm not bad. But, you know, I started very late.
[01:24:52.475 - 01:24:52.975] Speaker 2: So,
[01:24:53.275 - 01:24:56.415] Speaker 2: when I was working, I never got a chance to get into kitchen. I think,
[01:24:57.755 - 01:24:58.415] Speaker 2: my marriage
[01:25:01.595 - 01:25:04.335] Speaker 2: From my husband. A best cook. More more better cookie.
