When someone sees your life the way you speak about it, there's a lot of blessings at, like, a lot of points. You believe in karma? Absolutely. You believe in reincarnation? I do. Do you think about what you did in your previous life to get this life now? I hope so. I do. And I always think about it like if you think, why do I have why am I lucky enough to have the life that I do? And some other woman, somewhere else, with the same opportunity with the same desires, same ambitions, same, you know, needs doesn't have any of it. I really think about that a lot. It makes me feel like there must be something I did right. I wake up every day with a sense of gratitude, and I wake up every day with wanting to give back, whether that's with the person that is standing right next to me or whether that is a a life choice that I might make. But giving back, I think, is so crucial when it comes to being grateful. I'm highly grateful for everything that I have. And I do think that maybe I did something right, that I've been blessed with the opportunity of having the life, being born to the parents that I was, being able to have the opportunity of making my own choices, having agency in my own life. If you think about women around the world, so many don't have that. The complete choices are made for themselves. But my parents told me you have to have your opinion. What a privilege. Yeah. That's that's a part of the blessing being born to those parents. I mean, that's the biggest one probably. Yeah. Completely. Wow. Okay. Hold on. I gotta I gotta take my thoughts and just put them together. I made you speechless. No. No. Okay. With this whole journey Mhmm. And this is a question that's been sent in from a lot of people who I spoke to before this chat. Mhmm. I've firstly, I wanted wanna tell you that you inspire men, women, everyone.",

You believe in karma?\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: You believe in reincarnation?\n\nSpeaker 0: I do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you think about what you did in your previous life to get this life now?\n\nSpeaker 0: I hope so. I do. And I always think about it like if you think, why do I have why am I lucky enough to have the life that I do? And some other woman, somewhere else, with the same opportunity with the same desires, same ambitions, same, you know, needs doesn't have any of it. I really think about that a lot.\n\nIt makes me feel like there must be something I did right. I wake up every day with a sense of gratitude, and I wake up every day with wanting to give back, whether that's with the person that is standing right next to me or whether that is a a life choice that I might make. But giving back, I think, is so crucial when it comes to being grateful. I'm highly grateful for everything that I have. And I do think that maybe I did something right, that I've been blessed with the opportunity of having the life, being born to the parents that I was, being able to have the opportunity of making my own choices, having agency in my own life.\n\nIf you think about women around the world, so many don't have that. The complete choices are made for themselves. But my parents told me you have to have your opinion. What a privilege.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's that's a part of the blessing being born to those parents. I mean, that's the biggest one probably. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Completely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow. Okay. Hold on. I gotta I gotta take my thoughts and just put them together.\n\nSpeaker 0: I made you speechless.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. Okay. With this whole journey Mhmm. And this is a question that's been sent in from a lot of people who I spoke to before this chat.\n\nMhmm. I've firstly, I wanted wanna tell you that you inspire men, women, everyone.",
