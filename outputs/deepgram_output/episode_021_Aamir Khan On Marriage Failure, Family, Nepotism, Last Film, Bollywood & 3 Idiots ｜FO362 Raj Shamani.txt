So maybe there's an advantage to it, but my consciously, I'm very curious as a person. I don't know. You wanted curiosity to remain. I understand. Maybe quality, but I'm saying need the person only this much to give you some understanding. Yeah. Your curiosity should not be satiated. I'll try. There's an experiment to be done. Let's see what works. There's a long way to go Yeah. Lunch But you you you know, you form a certain connect with the person. But you have to be strict not to ask those questions on the first day.
