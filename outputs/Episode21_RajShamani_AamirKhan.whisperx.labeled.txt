[00:00:00.066 - 00:00:04.212] Host: There was a point in childhood where you felt that I had to grow up.
[00:00:04.592 - 00:00:05.954] Guest: I was responsible for my childhood.
[00:00:05.974 - 00:00:08.097] Guest: There were a lot of financial problems at home.
[00:00:08.117 - 00:00:10.480] Guest: I didn't have any income for 8 years.
[00:00:10.640 - 00:00:11.481] Guest: And I had money on loan.
[00:00:11.501 - 00:00:14.045] Guest: So, I used to get my phone calls at home.
[00:00:14.065 - 00:00:14.606] Guest: Now, when are you paying?
[00:00:14.826 - 00:00:18.170] Guest: It was a very difficult period for me.
[00:00:18.210 - 00:00:20.153] Host: What was your biggest mistake in life?
[00:00:20.173 - 00:00:22.216] Guest: Reena and I got married very early.
[00:00:22.236 - 00:00:24.419] Guest: I was 20 years old and she was 19 years old.
[00:00:24.579 - 00:00:26.962] Guest: And we only knew each other for 4 months before that.
[00:00:26.982 - 00:00:29.746] Guest: It was an important step like marriage.
[00:00:30.018 - 00:00:31.721] Guest: You should think about it.
[00:00:31.741 - 00:00:35.346] Guest: At that time, you don't understand many things in your youth.
[00:00:35.546 - 00:00:37.730] Guest: Peena and I respect each other a lot.
[00:00:37.890 - 00:00:39.452] Guest: And we love each other a lot.
[00:00:39.673 - 00:00:42.156] Host: If you have to pinpoint yourself, there's a red flag.
[00:00:42.176 - 00:00:45.461] Guest: Earlier, when I was in pain or when someone hurt me, you wouldn't be able to reach me.
[00:00:45.481 - 00:00:48.466] Guest: Jui and I fought for 7 years.
[00:00:48.626 - 00:00:50.890] Guest: I didn't talk to Jui for 7 years.
[00:00:50.910 - 00:00:51.791] Guest: Why do you cry?
[00:00:52.091 - 00:00:53.694] Guest: I cry very easily.
[00:00:53.714 - 00:00:54.916] Guest: I cry at least 8-10 times a day.
[00:00:54.936 - 00:00:58.882] Host: Is there anyone in your life who has the most sacrifice for you?
[00:00:58.902 - 00:00:59.122] Guest: Mother.
[00:00:59.330 - 00:01:00.992] Guest: Do what you want to do, don't show your heart to anyone.
[00:01:01.012 - 00:01:04.117] Guest: This is a big mistake that Kami gave me.
[00:01:04.237 - 00:01:09.545] Host: Did you feel lonely at any point?
[00:01:09.565 - 00:01:11.848] Host: A trait that you want your child to never learn from you?
[00:01:11.908 - 00:01:16.655] Guest: A man should not be so judgmental and so strict in terms of emotions.
[00:01:16.695 - 00:01:24.466] Host: Your movie does good or bad, it affects a lot that Junaid's movie does good or bad.
[00:01:25.634 - 00:01:27.980] Guest: Where is the release on the star of the earth?
[00:01:28.281 - 00:01:31.348] Guest: The theater is being released on the star of the earth.
[00:01:31.689 - 00:01:33.955] Guest: I am a filmmaker.
[00:01:33.975 - 00:01:36.100] Guest: Have you ever been hurt?
[00:01:36.180 - 00:01:38.827] Guest: I haven't given time to my children.
[00:01:38.867 - 00:01:41.373] Guest: I haven't spent so much time with my mother.
[00:01:41.393 - 00:01:43.378] Guest: I think I have done a lot of injustice to them.
[00:01:52.194 - 00:01:54.156] Host: Every shift is a very stressful task.
[00:01:54.176 - 00:01:56.619] Host: What day should we shift to get the Packers and Movers?
[00:01:56.659 - 00:01:59.342] Host: What will the local Packers and Movers get on time?
[00:01:59.782 - 00:02:01.043] Host: Will they be reliable?
[00:02:01.063 - 00:02:05.728] Host: And if something breaks somewhere, that's why I trust Porter Packers and Movers.
[00:02:05.948 - 00:02:13.476] Host: Because this gives booking slots according to you, helpers with safe packaging materials, and a guarantee of safe shifting of Rs.
[00:02:13.516 - 00:02:14.718] Host: 500,000.
[00:02:14.738 - 00:02:17.040] Host: Now, should we shift in the same city or in a different city?
[00:02:17.581 - 00:02:18.802] Host: It will happen with Porter.
[00:02:19.266 - 00:02:24.396] Host: Put the safety condition along with the porter so that your shifting experience is perfect.
[00:02:24.857 - 00:02:26.120] Host: Download the app now.
[00:02:26.140 - 00:02:35.258] Host: And when it comes to perfection, there is a person who is remembered to find perfection in every scene in Bollywood.
[00:02:35.278 - 00:02:37.042] Host: Our guest today, Amir Khan.
[00:02:37.570 - 00:02:40.374] Host: Today we will learn from them what are their red flags?
[00:02:41.276 - 00:02:43.879] Host: What are their biggest mistakes in life?
[00:02:43.899 - 00:02:47.425] Host: What are the things that they want their children to learn from them?
[00:02:47.445 - 00:02:50.589] Host: And what are the things that they want to teach their children?
[00:02:50.609 - 00:02:52.132] Host: How do they choose such hit films?
[00:02:52.152 - 00:02:54.535] Host: What are the challenges of body transformation?
[00:02:54.555 - 00:02:57.199] Host: Why did Satyamev Jayate stop?
[00:02:57.219 - 00:02:59.983] Host: Where will her new movie be released?
[00:03:00.264 - 00:03:04.530] Host: How did she deal with her romantic relationship in her life?
[00:03:04.962 - 00:03:11.552] Host: We know Amir Khan for perfection, but today his candid, imperfect and perfect will be seen.
[00:03:11.992 - 00:03:17.701] Host: Enjoy the show.
[00:03:17.721 - 00:03:22.688] Host: There was a point in childhood where you felt that now I will have to grow up.
[00:03:22.808 - 00:03:23.589] Host: Now I have grown up.
[00:03:25.713 - 00:03:26.834] Host: I don't feel that yet.
[00:03:30.520 - 00:03:32.082] Host: But maturity, what do you feel?
[00:03:32.482 - 00:03:33.303] Host: At what point?
[00:03:33.323 - 00:03:36.827] Host: Every child feels at a time that, come on, now it's responsibility, we've grown up.
[00:03:37.087 - 00:03:38.889] Host: What point did it take?
[00:03:38.909 - 00:03:41.612] Host: Someone comes in 30, someone comes in 10 years.
[00:03:41.632 - 00:03:42.973] Host: What was that point for you?
[00:03:42.993 - 00:03:45.016] Guest: There were a lot of financial problems at home.
[00:03:45.036 - 00:03:50.762] Guest: Abba Jan, who was making films, usually people think that there will be a lot of money in the producer's house, film producer.
[00:03:51.583 - 00:03:52.383] Guest: There is no truth in this.
[00:03:54.145 - 00:03:57.789] Guest: Most of the producers struggle a lot, you know, to make ends meet.
[00:03:58.150 - 00:04:00.212] Guest: Actually, one of their films was stuck for a very long time, Lock It.
[00:04:00.652 - 00:04:01.353] Guest: Okay.
[00:04:01.373 - 00:04:02.194] Guest: It took 8 years to make it.
[00:04:03.170 - 00:04:09.399] Guest: So the actors were having problems with their dates.
[00:04:09.620 - 00:04:15.508] Guest: The film had to be made in a year or two, but it went on for eight years.
[00:04:15.528 - 00:04:19.575] Guest: So there was no income for eight years at home.
[00:04:19.595 - 00:04:24.141] Guest: And because Bajan had taken the money on loan, the interest was 36%.
[00:04:24.161 - 00:04:29.489] Guest: Yes, top level interest.
[00:04:29.509 - 00:04:29.970] Guest: So...
[00:04:31.490 - 00:04:34.433] Guest: There was a rough patch in the middle, you know.
[00:04:34.453 - 00:04:35.995] Guest: So when did you realise?
[00:04:36.015 - 00:04:36.456] Guest: As a kid.
[00:04:36.476 - 00:04:38.057] Host: Actually when I...
[00:04:38.077 - 00:04:41.181] Host: He had financial problems at home because everyone didn't realise it.
[00:04:41.201 - 00:04:42.502] Host: He only understood after one point.
[00:04:42.562 - 00:04:43.864] Guest: No, he didn't understand.
[00:04:43.884 - 00:04:45.486] Guest: Because we used to get a phone call at home.
[00:04:46.807 - 00:04:47.568] Guest: When are you paying the money?
[00:04:47.908 - 00:04:50.632] Guest: Those who had paid the money, had put it in the film.
[00:04:50.652 - 00:04:51.132] Guest: The film had stopped.
[00:04:52.173 - 00:04:54.596] Guest: Until the film was released, you couldn't get the money back.
[00:04:56.078 - 00:04:59.922] Guest: So he was stuck in a, you know, in a vicious circle.
[00:05:00.034 - 00:05:02.456] Guest: No one is paying any more, the film is moving forward.
[00:05:02.476 - 00:05:06.440] Guest: As long as the film moves forward, the money will not come, the film will be released, only then will the money come.
[00:05:06.460 - 00:05:10.144] Guest: So they passed through a very difficult period.
[00:05:10.484 - 00:05:13.287] Guest: And I remember when I was small, I used to play tennis a lot.
[00:05:13.307 - 00:05:15.029] Guest: I used to play competitive level.
[00:05:15.049 - 00:05:20.615] Guest: And the money that I used to earn through tennis, I used to keep it with my mother.
[00:05:20.655 - 00:05:27.922] Guest: And since I knew that it was painful at home, I used to tell my mother that you should buy anything for me, buy shoes, buy clothes, you take my money.
[00:05:28.738 - 00:05:33.666] Guest: So when I'm saying all this, I'm realizing that I had become responsible since a young age.
[00:05:33.686 - 00:05:36.871] Host: Is there any value or anything that comes from your father?
[00:05:37.031 - 00:05:38.313] Guest: Yes.
[00:05:38.333 - 00:05:42.940] Guest: There was one thing in my father that he was a very strong personality.
[00:05:42.960 - 00:05:43.721] Guest: He didn't give up.
[00:05:43.741 - 00:05:44.042] Guest: Okay.
[00:05:44.062 - 00:05:49.530] Guest: No matter how much pain he had in front of him, he had experienced a lot of pain.
[00:05:49.550 - 00:05:51.273] Guest: He used to face him, he didn't give up.
[00:05:51.293 - 00:05:52.935] Guest: So I have learned that from him.
[00:05:52.955 - 00:05:57.202] Guest: Secondly,
[00:05:58.818 - 00:06:00.000] Guest: He was a man of his word.
[00:06:01.381 - 00:06:03.625] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:04.846 - 00:06:06.048] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:06.068 - 00:06:06.929] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:06.949 - 00:06:07.970] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:08.591 - 00:06:09.533] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:10.093 - 00:06:11.475] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:13.197 - 00:06:13.898] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:13.918 - 00:06:14.900] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:14.920 - 00:06:16.081] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:16.702 - 00:06:18.324] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:18.344 - 00:06:19.386] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:19.406 - 00:06:21.108] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:21.128 - 00:06:22.811] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:22.831 - 00:06:23.812] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:23.832 - 00:06:24.873] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:26.295 - 00:06:27.297] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:27.337 - 00:06:28.338] Guest: So he was a man of his word.
[00:06:28.418 - 00:06:29.499] Guest: He was a man of his word.
[00:06:29.519 - 00:06:32.503] Guest: He used to stick to his commitments.
[00:06:34.125 - 00:06:35.827] Guest: So there are a lot of things I have learned from him.
[00:06:36.167 - 00:06:37.269] Guest: Yeah.
[00:06:37.289 - 00:06:41.574] Guest: When we used to listen to stories, I always remember that the story would end.
[00:06:43.216 - 00:06:46.680] Guest: Writer and director would say, you have told your story in one line.
[00:06:47.561 - 00:06:51.666] Guest: If you can't tell your story in one line, then the film won't hit.
[00:06:52.706 - 00:06:55.871] Guest: So I was small, I used to think that the poor guy has been listening to the story for three hours.
[00:06:55.911 - 00:06:56.833] Guest: How will he listen to it in one line?
[00:06:57.955 - 00:06:59.157] Guest: Abba Jan is getting very unreasonable.
[00:06:59.177 - 00:07:04.926] Guest: But later when I grew up and understood about filmmaking, I realized what he was actually saying.
[00:07:04.946 - 00:07:06.569] Guest: What is your premise?
[00:07:06.589 - 00:07:08.953] Guest: What are you trying to say?
[00:07:09.754 - 00:07:10.696] Guest: You should say that in one line.
[00:07:11.818 - 00:07:13.540] Guest: My girls are less than boys.
[00:07:15.143 - 00:07:16.605] Guest: This is a story in one line in Dangal.
[00:07:18.308 - 00:07:19.410] Guest: Do you understand what I am saying?
[00:07:19.522 - 00:07:21.224] Guest: So what do you want to say?
[00:07:21.244 - 00:07:26.070] Guest: If you can't say one line, then your film will be confused.
[00:07:27.551 - 00:07:34.700] Host: Tell me about one of your failures, where you thought that this is the biggest failure and which still hurts you probably.
[00:07:36.021 - 00:07:39.785] Host: One flop or one failure that still affects you.
[00:07:39.805 - 00:07:43.730] Guest: Most of the films that I didn't go to, I didn't like them either.
[00:07:43.906 - 00:07:45.688] Guest: So I thought it was right.
[00:07:45.708 - 00:07:46.028] Guest: It wasn't right.
[00:07:46.048 - 00:07:46.909] Guest: It wasn't magic.
[00:07:46.949 - 00:07:48.470] Guest: No, it wasn't right.
[00:07:48.490 - 00:07:50.432] Guest: The audience was right.
[00:07:50.512 - 00:07:51.834] Guest: I thought it wasn't right.
[00:07:51.854 - 00:07:56.498] Guest: But one film that I did that made me very sad was Laal Singh Chadda.
[00:07:56.518 - 00:07:57.359] Host: Okay.
[00:07:57.379 - 00:08:00.142] Guest: Laal Singh Chadda, I thought we made a good film.
[00:08:01.864 - 00:08:06.428] Guest: So my emotions were with the film.
[00:08:06.448 - 00:08:09.131] Guest: And I thought we made a good film.
[00:08:09.351 - 00:08:12.174] Guest: But the audience didn't like it.
[00:08:12.194 - 00:08:12.594] Guest: So that...
[00:08:12.674 - 00:08:14.817] Guest: That was a big emotional hit for me.
[00:08:16.259 - 00:08:19.063] Guest: And I didn't have any unsuccessful films till this time.
[00:08:19.844 - 00:08:22.627] Guest: So one after the other, two films were unsuccessful for me.
[00:08:22.647 - 00:08:24.950] Guest: One was Thugs of Hindustan.
[00:08:26.633 - 00:08:29.176] Guest: But I wasn't surprised in that.
[00:08:29.236 - 00:08:30.438] Guest: Because I didn't like Thugs either.
[00:08:31.539 - 00:08:32.501] Guest: I can say it openly today.
[00:08:32.521 - 00:08:35.465] Guest: I tried a lot with Adi and Victor.
[00:08:35.485 - 00:08:39.570] Guest: Anyway, they don't go in that.
[00:08:40.994 - 00:08:42.936] Guest: When the film was released, I wasn't happy either.
[00:08:43.577 - 00:08:44.478] Guest: I'll tell you a story.
[00:08:44.939 - 00:08:52.148] Guest: Kiran, who is my ex-wife, knows that when my release comes, I can't sleep for two months.
[00:08:52.168 - 00:08:54.091] Guest: Like, I can't sleep right now.
[00:08:54.111 - 00:08:54.652] Guest: I can't sleep.
[00:08:55.292 - 00:08:58.957] Guest: My mind works all the time.
[00:08:59.017 - 00:09:02.942] Guest: Before the release of Thugs of India, Kiran said to me, the release is near.
[00:09:03.243 - 00:09:06.867] Guest: You are sleeping so peacefully.
[00:09:06.887 - 00:09:09.010] Guest: So Kiran, because I know that film won't be released.
[00:09:09.730 - 00:09:18.021] Guest: I have no excitement, no anticipation that I am waiting for people to watch my film.
[00:09:18.041 - 00:09:22.067] Guest: In fact, I feel better that people are going to watch my film.
[00:09:22.087 - 00:09:25.451] Guest: And I myself am not happy with the film.
[00:09:27.774 - 00:09:30.178] Guest: But the producer and director are happy, so what can I say?
[00:09:30.698 - 00:09:32.320] Guest: So anyway.
[00:09:32.340 - 00:09:36.466] Guest: But in the film, when it didn't work out, then I...
[00:09:36.738 - 00:09:44.630] Guest: Did you express that?
[00:09:44.931 - 00:09:45.612] Guest: Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:45.632 - 00:09:47.655] Guest: I expressed it very strongly to Adi and Victor.
[00:09:48.336 - 00:09:50.059] Guest: But they were a confident of it.
[00:09:50.640 - 00:09:51.621] Guest: Look, I don't blame them either.
[00:09:51.641 - 00:09:52.663] Guest: This is creative work.
[00:09:53.244 - 00:09:54.967] Guest: You can go with your instincts.
[00:09:55.427 - 00:09:56.409] Guest: Fair.
[00:09:56.429 - 00:10:00.475] Guest: So the director and producer's instinct was that we made a very good film and it was going to work.
[00:10:01.317 - 00:10:03.660] Guest: I thought that no, this film won't ask for water.
[00:10:03.680 - 00:10:04.722] Guest: I thought that it was going to work.
[00:10:04.930 - 00:10:11.300] Guest: Adi used to say, when a man dies, he says, water, water.
[00:10:11.320 - 00:10:14.905] Guest: And sometimes he doesn't even have the strength to ask for water.
[00:10:15.686 - 00:10:16.628] Guest: So this is from there.
[00:10:16.648 - 00:10:21.054] Guest: So I said, this film didn't even ask for water.
[00:10:21.074 - 00:10:24.880] Guest: So anyway, that's why I don't have such a big disappointment at that time.
[00:10:24.900 - 00:10:29.987] Guest: Disappointment and my heart was broken at the time of Lalsing Chadda.
[00:10:31.069 - 00:10:34.354] Guest: Because I really liked that story.
[00:10:34.946 - 00:10:37.609] Guest: Maybe that was a remake and many people had seen Forrest Gump.
[00:10:37.629 - 00:10:41.434] Guest: So maybe that's why it didn't work.
[00:10:41.454 - 00:10:42.796] Guest: Or people didn't connect.
[00:10:43.957 - 00:10:45.419] Guest: I think my work wasn't right.
[00:10:45.559 - 00:10:47.642] Guest: I think I had pitched the performance too high.
[00:10:47.662 - 00:10:51.947] Guest: So that didn't connect with the characters.
[00:10:51.967 - 00:10:53.449] Guest: So we went wrong in that film.
[00:10:53.469 - 00:10:57.274] Guest: According to me, we went wrong in that film.
[00:10:57.294 - 00:11:00.838] Guest: But my emotion was very deep with that film.
[00:11:00.858 - 00:11:03.341] Guest: So that's why I had a lot of hits.
[00:11:03.362 - 00:11:03.762] Guest: A lot of hits.
[00:11:04.770 - 00:11:09.596] Guest: And I thought for a long time that maybe...
[00:11:09.616 - 00:11:15.845] Guest: I don't know... During that time, one more thing was becoming very interesting.
[00:11:15.865 - 00:11:20.992] Guest: It was the time of Covid.
[00:11:21.012 - 00:11:23.956] Guest: At the time of Covid, Lal Singh Chanda had become Adi.
[00:11:23.976 - 00:11:27.040] Guest: Exactly, we were in the halfway.
[00:11:27.060 - 00:11:30.164] Guest: Adi was formed and Adi was formed because of Covid.
[00:11:30.184 - 00:11:31.666] Guest: So we stopped everything.
[00:11:31.970 - 00:11:34.212] Guest: When I stopped working, I got a chance to think.
[00:11:34.232 - 00:11:56.717] Guest: From the beginning of my career, at the age of 18, when I became an assistant, from then to COVID, I was so lost in the madness and intoxication and the romance of cinema, that I had never stopped to turn my life around and see what is happening in my life.
[00:11:58.058 - 00:12:01.842] Guest: Because the intoxication of cinema is very much.
[00:12:02.626 - 00:12:05.709] Guest: And anyway, it's too much for me.
[00:12:05.729 - 00:12:10.333] Guest: So due to COVID, the compulsory pause came.
[00:12:10.354 - 00:12:11.775] Guest: I was not able to work.
[00:12:11.795 - 00:12:16.760] Guest: I was not able to meet anyone.
[00:12:17.661 - 00:12:19.182] Guest: I was stuck at home.
[00:12:19.202 - 00:12:20.924] Guest: So I got a chance to think.
[00:12:21.064 - 00:12:27.470] Guest: And when I started thinking and seeing my life, I realized that I have not given time to my children.
[00:12:27.490 - 00:12:29.272] Guest: I have not spent so much time with my mother.
[00:12:30.273 - 00:12:31.474] Guest: Reena, Kiran.
[00:12:32.450 - 00:12:41.363] Guest: My brother and sister, who are very close to me, I may have done a lot of injustice with them.
[00:12:41.383 - 00:12:45.689] Guest: And when this thought came, this thought started increasing very quickly.
[00:12:46.550 - 00:12:49.074] Guest: And I started blaming myself a lot.
[00:12:49.094 - 00:12:51.717] Guest: I went into the guilt a lot.
[00:12:51.737 - 00:12:56.424] Guest: And I felt very bad that this was a very big mistake from me.
[00:12:56.444 - 00:12:57.746] Guest: I was blind, maybe.
[00:12:58.114 - 00:13:01.399] Guest: When I say this, people think, I don't know how hard I will be.
[00:13:01.499 - 00:13:03.181] Guest: It's not like that.
[00:13:03.201 - 00:13:05.705] Guest: Compared to other fathers, I was better.
[00:13:06.606 - 00:13:08.569] Guest: Frankly, let me tell you.
[00:13:08.710 - 00:13:12.836] Guest: Because I still have a very good connection with children.
[00:13:13.116 - 00:13:15.179] Guest: But my attention was not there.
[00:13:15.199 - 00:13:16.761] Guest: My attention was somewhere else.
[00:13:16.781 - 00:13:17.983] Guest: So I had a very big realization.
[00:13:18.003 - 00:13:22.610] Guest: And after that, that thing
[00:13:23.426 - 00:13:26.831] Guest: I had become half of the Red Singh.
[00:13:26.851 - 00:13:29.294] Guest: So at that time I decided that I will leave the film now.
[00:13:29.314 - 00:13:33.640] Guest: I will not do any film after today.
[00:13:33.660 - 00:13:38.687] Guest: I was so angry at myself and at the cinema which kept me away from my family.
[00:13:38.707 - 00:13:41.271] Guest: This is a very illogical thing.
[00:13:41.291 - 00:13:42.973] Guest: I am telling you an emotional reaction.
[00:13:43.614 - 00:13:46.758] Guest: At that time I was in so much guilt and my breakdown was so much.
[00:13:47.479 - 00:13:48.761] Guest: Literally my breakdown was done.
[00:13:48.781 - 00:13:52.306] Guest: So I was in a very bad state and I called the family and said
[00:13:52.642 - 00:13:55.747] Guest: that I am very ashamed of myself.
[00:13:55.767 - 00:13:57.149] Guest: And I am going to correct this.
[00:13:57.169 - 00:13:59.011] Guest: I will not do any film after today.
[00:13:59.452 - 00:14:00.534] Guest: Lalsing has become Adi.
[00:14:01.054 - 00:14:02.737] Guest: We will complete this and release it.
[00:14:04.099 - 00:14:04.459] Guest: That's it.
[00:14:04.479 - 00:14:05.761] Guest: Then I have to live with my family.
[00:14:05.781 - 00:14:13.372] Guest: So the family was also shocked to hear what this man is saying.
[00:14:13.392 - 00:14:15.556] Guest: So they thought that he is talking about cinema.
[00:14:15.576 - 00:14:15.956] Guest: He is so crazy.
[00:14:15.976 - 00:14:17.639] Guest: He will never be able to leave it in his life.
[00:14:18.961 - 00:14:19.922] Guest: He is not a chancee.
[00:14:20.706 - 00:14:22.449] Guest: The response was the same for the children.
[00:14:22.469 - 00:14:23.711] Guest: But what happened was that I actually quit.
[00:14:23.771 - 00:14:31.565] Guest: And I called Advaith when COVID-19 ended and the work started.
[00:14:31.585 - 00:14:34.971] Guest: So I called Advaith, I called Advaith, I am moving back from the film.
[00:14:34.991 - 00:14:39.840] Guest: As an actor, as a producer, whatever responsibility I have, I will fulfill.
[00:14:40.481 - 00:14:41.723] Guest: I will not even step back.
[00:14:41.743 - 00:14:43.346] Guest: I am a team player.
[00:14:43.522 - 00:14:47.586] Guest: But the more I was involved in every department, I won't do that.
[00:14:47.646 - 00:14:52.871] Guest: You are very capable, Adwiyat, you and all the directors, all the HODs are very capable.
[00:14:52.891 - 00:14:53.832] Guest: I don't need it.
[00:14:53.852 - 00:14:56.154] Guest: I had interest, so I was involved.
[00:14:56.174 - 00:14:57.836] Guest: You don't need it, you will do the right thing.
[00:14:57.856 - 00:15:00.679] Guest: So I didn't go to any meeting.
[00:15:01.319 - 00:15:02.220] Guest: Editing, Adwiyat did.
[00:15:02.240 - 00:15:04.142] Guest: I was just checking.
[00:15:05.443 - 00:15:06.384] Guest: The producer's work.
[00:15:06.785 - 00:15:09.808] Guest: If I didn't like anything, I would have done it again.
[00:15:09.828 - 00:15:12.210] Guest: But the producer's work comes at the end.
[00:15:14.018 - 00:15:20.767] Guest: So I had already done that action and stopped going to office.
[00:15:20.787 - 00:15:29.939] Guest: When I started, Aira, my daughter, she opened a non-profit company called Agatsu, which works in mental health.
[00:15:29.959 - 00:15:32.062] Guest: So I started going to office with Aira.
[00:15:32.703 - 00:15:41.495] Guest: Actually, when I made this decision, Prasanna was also waiting for the star to start.
[00:15:41.575 - 00:15:44.018] Guest: So I thought I should tell her that I don't want to do it.
[00:15:44.098 - 00:15:48.142] Guest: Because I didn't tell anyone in the industry that I am retiring.
[00:15:48.162 - 00:15:54.107] Guest: I didn't want to do anything that I am retiring and that I am doing this and that.
[00:15:54.127 - 00:15:56.189] Guest: I said that my film will be released after 3-4 years.
[00:15:56.930 - 00:15:59.032] Guest: So Lalsing will go away.
[00:15:59.052 - 00:16:02.315] Guest: People will think that it will be released after 3-4 years.
[00:16:02.375 - 00:16:03.977] Guest: If it doesn't come, they will forget.
[00:16:03.997 - 00:16:07.120] Guest: Because I make so few films, so people forget in today's date.
[00:16:07.660 - 00:16:08.501] Guest: They leave very soon.
[00:16:08.561 - 00:16:14.066] Guest: So why won't I need to say that when people will ask for 3-4 years, I will say that I have left.
[00:16:14.498 - 00:16:16.861] Guest: I didn't want to do any big announcement.
[00:16:16.881 - 00:16:33.302] Guest: So one day I called Prasanna from Chennai to say that you should see the actor because I am not working in the future.
[00:16:33.322 - 00:16:39.329] Guest: Earlier in the industry, I was going to tell people that I am leaving the film.
[00:16:39.369 - 00:16:43.314] Guest: So one day before that,
[00:16:44.162 - 00:16:48.108] Guest: My children explained to me that what are you going to do?
[00:16:48.249 - 00:16:51.053] Guest: I am going to tell them that I am not going to film.
[00:16:51.975 - 00:16:57.223] Guest: So they said, what are you going to do?
[00:16:57.243 - 00:17:00.188] Guest: So they said, I am going to spend time with you.
[00:17:00.208 - 00:17:04.595] Guest: So they said, you have been doing it for 6 months.
[00:17:04.615 - 00:17:06.518] Guest: Now it has become a little more.
[00:17:06.538 - 00:17:06.999] Guest: We also have a life.
[00:17:07.019 - 00:17:08.642] Guest: We also need a little space.
[00:17:09.583 - 00:17:11.186] Guest: So I said, this will be bad.
[00:17:11.682 - 00:17:13.764] Guest: So actually they were being very practical.
[00:17:14.305 - 00:17:16.387] Guest: And Aira made a whiteboard.
[00:17:16.447 - 00:17:20.210] Guest: He said, you are completely involved in Agatso.
[00:17:20.371 - 00:17:23.554] Guest: We are planning 12 things ahead of Agatso.
[00:17:23.574 - 00:17:26.457] Guest: Which of these things are you going to do?
[00:17:26.477 - 00:17:28.078] Guest: So I said, these are three things.
[00:17:28.098 - 00:17:30.040] Guest: How much time will you spend in this?
[00:17:31.221 - 00:17:32.683] Guest: I said, 15 days.
[00:17:32.703 - 00:17:34.324] Guest: So what will you do for the rest of 85%?
[00:17:34.385 - 00:17:36.286] Guest: I said, I will be with you.
[00:17:36.387 - 00:17:38.048] Guest: I said, no, no.
[00:17:38.068 - 00:17:38.749] Guest: I said, now it's too much.
[00:17:38.769 - 00:17:39.890] Guest: And Junaid said, you are like a pendulum.
[00:17:41.026 - 00:17:44.911] Guest: You go straight from here to here.
[00:17:44.931 - 00:17:48.376] Guest: There is nothing in the center.
[00:17:48.396 - 00:17:50.499] Guest: You stay in the left and stay in the right.
[00:17:50.579 - 00:17:50.980] Guest: Extreme.
[00:17:51.000 - 00:17:53.483] Guest: I am an extreme personality.
[00:17:53.503 - 00:17:56.067] Guest: Either you are doing films or you are doing them all the time.
[00:17:56.167 - 00:17:59.231] Guest: If you are not doing it, then you are not doing it at all.
[00:17:59.251 - 00:18:00.853] Guest: So you are extreme.
[00:18:00.873 - 00:18:04.478] Guest: Dad, you are always in extremes.
[00:18:04.498 - 00:18:06.401] Guest: Try to get a little balanced.
[00:18:06.421 - 00:18:07.943] Guest: You can work for 8 hours.
[00:18:08.003 - 00:18:10.106] Guest: After that come home at 6.
[00:18:10.126 - 00:18:10.386] Guest: Stay with us.
[00:18:11.938 - 00:18:15.945] Guest: So he actually explained to me that you shouldn't leave the film.
[00:18:16.446 - 00:18:18.109] Host: How do you lower this voice in your head?
[00:18:18.770 - 00:18:29.227] Host: That when it flopped and then I could have done a little better, or I could have done better, or maybe now I didn't save that charm, the voices came out and doubted me.
[00:18:29.248 - 00:18:30.450] Host: So how do you kill your mind?
[00:18:30.470 - 00:18:33.074] Guest: There is no way to kill it.
[00:18:35.074 - 00:18:36.716] Guest: Look, I'm a very realistic person.
[00:18:36.896 - 00:18:37.897] Guest: That's my strength.
[00:18:37.917 - 00:18:38.999] Guest: I don't fool myself.
[00:18:39.019 - 00:18:41.902] Guest: When I look at my work, I understand that it's a weakness.
[00:18:42.483 - 00:18:43.805] Guest: I made a mistake here.
[00:18:43.845 - 00:18:44.846] Guest: I took a wrong judgment.
[00:18:46.728 - 00:18:48.490] Guest: So that's very important.
[00:18:49.592 - 00:18:50.613] Guest: For self-analysis.
[00:18:51.074 - 00:18:53.897] Guest: So I think that's my sharpness.
[00:18:53.917 - 00:18:58.182] Guest: And that's a good thing.
[00:18:58.202 - 00:19:00.205] Guest: I'm a very emotional person.
[00:19:00.225 - 00:19:04.530] Guest: So when I lose something, whether it's a person or my work,
[00:19:04.706 - 00:19:09.174] Guest: film where we had so much hope that it didn't connect at all.
[00:19:10.095 - 00:19:11.277] Guest: So I feel very sad.
[00:19:11.417 - 00:19:13.821] Guest: And I completely accept that shock.
[00:19:14.322 - 00:19:16.205] Guest: I don't stop it.
[00:19:16.225 - 00:19:20.392] Guest: I live in that depression.
[00:19:20.452 - 00:19:23.297] Guest: And I don't hide it.
[00:19:23.317 - 00:19:28.386] Guest: And then I get out of it.
[00:19:28.406 - 00:19:30.930] Guest: And then...
[00:19:31.138 - 00:19:35.242] Guest: what I have made mistakes, then I look at them very technically, to understand them.
[00:19:35.923 - 00:19:38.286] Guest: Analyzing them, where did I go wrong?
[00:19:38.326 - 00:19:41.369] Guest: This time I don't want to repeat the same mistake again.
[00:19:42.270 - 00:19:43.771] Guest: Make a mistake, but do a new one.
[00:19:44.392 - 00:19:45.733] Guest: I don't want to repeat that mistake again.
[00:19:47.115 - 00:19:50.458] Guest: So, I take it very positively after a point.
[00:19:51.319 - 00:19:54.303] Guest: First I eat dhaka and I collapse.
[00:19:54.983 - 00:19:55.324] Guest: Shatter.
[00:19:55.744 - 00:19:57.586] Host: But then you analytically pick it.
[00:19:58.818 - 00:19:59.960] Guest: I stand again one by one.
[00:19:59.980 - 00:20:02.064] Guest: Yes, this is wrong, this is wrong.
[00:20:02.084 - 00:20:05.050] Guest: You have to do this in the future.
[00:20:05.611 - 00:20:07.935] Guest: And I really try and learn from my mistakes.
[00:20:08.336 - 00:20:10.680] Guest: Because actually you learn from your mistakes the most.
[00:20:10.700 - 00:20:17.172] Guest: And since so many years there was no flop, no unsuccessful film.
[00:20:17.353 - 00:20:20.819] Guest: The first time I was thinking about the audience, I was thinking about something else.
[00:20:21.801 - 00:20:22.322] Guest: So I...
[00:20:22.786 - 00:20:24.188] Guest: Jhatka laga.
[00:20:24.328 - 00:20:31.259] Guest: So I used it completely to understand where I went wrong in the performance, in every way.
[00:20:32.320 - 00:20:35.986] Guest: And my sense of humor is correct.
[00:20:36.987 - 00:20:41.835] Guest: Javid Sahab has said one thing, Javid Sahab, which I believe a lot.
[00:20:41.915 - 00:20:46.722] Guest: He said that sense of humor is not just to make fun or to make mood good.
[00:20:47.142 - 00:20:48.164] Guest: Okay.
[00:20:48.184 - 00:20:52.210] Guest: Sense of humor, actually the suspension in the car,
[00:20:52.770 - 00:20:56.214] Guest: That is sense of humor.
[00:20:56.234 - 00:21:02.081] Guest: When you are going on a road and it is a smooth road, then you don't have to rush.
[00:21:02.101 - 00:21:05.164] Guest: So you don't even need sense of humor.
[00:21:05.224 - 00:21:16.036] Guest: But when you are in the road of your life, and your car is going through a lot of thorns, which gives you life.
[00:21:16.056 - 00:21:21.042] Guest: If your sense of humor is still there, then it helps you
[00:21:21.154 - 00:21:24.038] Guest: you get a little absorbed in the emotions.
[00:21:24.058 - 00:21:25.119] Guest: You make fun of it.
[00:21:25.139 - 00:21:27.062] Guest: You make fun of yourself.
[00:21:27.082 - 00:21:28.604] Guest: You make fun of the situation.
[00:21:28.624 - 00:21:30.406] Guest: You see it in a lighter way.
[00:21:30.427 - 00:21:33.691] Guest: And you've seen what's right and what's wrong with us.
[00:21:33.711 - 00:21:36.735] Guest: So the ability to do that is actually sense of humor.
[00:21:36.755 - 00:21:38.237] Guest: It comes in real work.
[00:21:38.297 - 00:21:40.640] Guest: Javed said that real work is of sense of humor.
[00:21:40.660 - 00:21:43.965] Guest: When you are going through a difficult time in life.
[00:21:44.505 - 00:21:50.834] Guest: And in that difficult time, if you can laugh at yourself, then it cuts the path.
[00:21:51.714 - 00:21:54.677] Guest: I agree with him.
[00:21:54.697 - 00:21:57.601] Guest: So I feel that that's the kind of person I am.
[00:21:58.221 - 00:22:03.207] Guest: I accept my mistakes and try to improve them.
[00:22:04.669 - 00:22:07.552] Guest: And I bounce back quite strongly.
[00:22:07.852 - 00:22:11.056] Host: So according to you, what is your biggest mistake in life?
[00:22:12.177 - 00:22:14.119] Guest: Personal, professional or anything?
[00:22:14.139 - 00:22:14.260] Guest: Oh!
[00:22:14.280 - 00:22:15.281] Guest: The biggest mistake?
[00:22:15.301 - 00:22:16.402] Host: I should tell me in personal life.
[00:22:16.782 - 00:22:18.765] Host: What do you think is your biggest mistake?
[00:22:18.785 - 00:22:19.986] Guest: There are many mistakes, not one.
[00:22:20.738 - 00:22:29.528] Guest: But I think that because of those mistakes, what I am today, not only because of my success, but also because of my mistakes.
[00:22:29.548 - 00:22:32.151] Guest: Let me just say one simple thing.
[00:22:32.332 - 00:22:35.796] Guest: Reena and I got married very early.
[00:22:35.816 - 00:22:39.660] Guest: I was 21 years old, she was 18, 19 years old.
[00:22:39.680 - 00:22:48.050] Guest: In fact, the first day was legally possible for me to get married.
[00:22:48.578 - 00:22:51.862] Guest: After 21 years, you have to give a one-month notice.
[00:22:51.982 - 00:22:53.524] Guest: So, you go there for 30 days.
[00:22:53.544 - 00:22:58.629] Guest: So, on the 14th of March, when I was 21 years old, after that, I got a one-month notice.
[00:22:58.649 - 00:23:00.592] Guest: So, it was on the 14th of April.
[00:23:00.612 - 00:23:02.354] Guest: So, there was a Saturday Sunday there.
[00:23:02.374 - 00:23:06.358] Guest: So, the first day that I was married was legally possible.
[00:23:06.478 - 00:23:07.700] Guest: It was on the 18th of April.
[00:23:10.162 - 00:23:13.646] Guest: The earliest date that was legally acceptable for us to get married.
[00:23:13.666 - 00:23:14.527] Guest: 18th April.
[00:23:14.547 - 00:23:15.208] Guest: 18th April.
[00:23:15.228 - 00:23:16.850] Guest: And we got married on 18th April.
[00:23:17.890 - 00:23:20.813] Guest: And we only knew each other for four months.
[00:23:21.254 - 00:23:24.197] Guest: And we spent very little time with each other in those four months.
[00:23:24.217 - 00:23:27.641] Guest: We loved each other very much.
[00:23:27.661 - 00:23:32.727] Guest: We were very fond of each other.
[00:23:32.747 - 00:23:36.090] Guest: So that's why we got married.
[00:23:36.110 - 00:23:44.880] Guest: But when I look at it today, I feel that marriage is an important step.
[00:23:44.900 - 00:23:46.482] Guest: You should think about it.
[00:23:47.234 - 00:23:53.641] Guest: At that time, you don't understand a lot of things in your youth.
[00:23:53.681 - 00:23:57.746] Guest: But later on, you realize that although my life with Reena is a very good cut.
[00:23:58.566 - 00:24:02.531] Guest: So you don't get out of it that Reena was wrong.
[00:24:02.551 - 00:24:03.472] Guest: I don't mean that at all.
[00:24:03.492 - 00:24:12.342] Guest: In fact, Reena is an amazing person and we grew up together because we were so small when we got married.
[00:24:12.362 - 00:24:16.466] Guest: So Reena and I are very different.
[00:24:16.610 - 00:24:25.482] Guest: we respect each other and we have a lot of love for each other, love.
[00:24:26.283 - 00:24:34.493] Guest: But I think that someone should not take such a big step in such a young age, in such a difficult situation.
[00:24:34.513 - 00:24:39.219] Guest: So today when I see, that's one example, that maybe I am unique.
[00:24:39.239 - 00:24:42.404] Guest: But if I didn't do that, I wouldn't be sitting in front of you today.
[00:24:42.444 - 00:24:44.306] Guest: So I can't even believe that it's a mistake.
[00:24:44.738 - 00:24:49.465] Guest: That's why I can't accept it because of the two biggest gifts that I got from Aira and Junaid.
[00:24:49.565 - 00:24:52.910] Guest: I got to spend 16 years with Reena.
[00:24:52.930 - 00:24:54.853] Guest: So all these things are wrong.
[00:24:55.474 - 00:24:57.517] Guest: These are good things.
[00:24:57.537 - 00:25:02.164] Guest: So it's difficult.
[00:25:02.825 - 00:25:08.113] Guest: I will say it in a way that you have decided in 4 months that you are getting married.
[00:25:08.133 - 00:25:09.976] Guest: You have taken such a big decision so quickly.
[00:25:11.859 - 00:25:13.842] Guest: So many such things have happened in my life.
[00:25:14.178 - 00:25:16.441] Guest: But I feel that he is right somewhere.
[00:25:17.283 - 00:25:20.528] Guest: A man makes a mistake and learns from it.
[00:25:20.548 - 00:25:25.195] Guest: And whatever you make a mistake, then your life becomes that.
[00:25:25.896 - 00:25:29.782] Guest: Then you find your peace in that life.
[00:25:29.802 - 00:25:33.307] Guest: So it is a journey, a journey of yours, which is mine.
[00:25:33.327 - 00:25:38.034] Guest: When I see it today, I feel that if I meet someone in today's date, I can't take the decision of marriage in four months.
[00:25:38.690 - 00:25:40.633] Guest: I have to spend my life with it.
[00:25:40.913 - 00:25:43.558] Guest: At that time, I didn't even do therapy.
[00:25:43.578 - 00:25:46.923] Host: Nowadays, because I...
[00:25:46.983 - 00:25:47.564] Guest: I take therapy.
[00:25:47.584 - 00:25:49.246] Guest: I take a lot of self-reflection.
[00:25:49.266 - 00:25:51.450] Guest: So I got a chance of self-reflection.
[00:25:51.490 - 00:25:52.752] Guest: I understood.
[00:25:52.772 - 00:25:53.693] Guest: I understood myself.
[00:25:54.575 - 00:25:59.582] Guest: I see red flags very quickly now.
[00:26:00.744 - 00:26:03.488] Guest: Do you understand what happened?
[00:26:03.508 - 00:26:07.154] Guest: I mean, I think that I started therapy at the age of 18.
[00:26:08.386 - 00:26:11.069] Guest: So I would have understood life in a very different way.
[00:26:11.089 - 00:26:11.349] Guest: You know?
[00:26:12.450 - 00:26:12.710] Host: I know.
[00:26:13.131 - 00:26:14.632] Host: You said red flag.
[00:26:15.633 - 00:26:21.179] Host: So if you have to pinpoint yourself a red flag, because of which you broke up in your first marriage.
[00:26:21.839 - 00:26:23.881] Guest: Oh God!
[00:26:24.082 - 00:26:29.387] Guest: Put out one trait.
[00:26:30.048 - 00:26:32.030] Host: Maybe this was a trait I was not able to give.
[00:26:32.490 - 00:26:36.434] Guest: I think the one trait that I would say is that I was too lost in my films.
[00:26:37.602 - 00:26:38.263] Guest: That's the fact.
[00:26:38.584 - 00:26:40.306] Host: So your red flag is your workaholic?
[00:26:40.326 - 00:26:40.747] Host: Or you was?
[00:26:41.168 - 00:26:42.990] Guest: I was a workaholic.
[00:26:43.010 - 00:26:44.593] Guest: That was, I would say, a red flag.
[00:26:44.613 - 00:26:44.813] Guest: Yes.
[00:26:45.434 - 00:26:47.117] Host: What other red flags would you give?
[00:26:47.137 - 00:26:49.200] Guest: I was very emotional earlier.
[00:26:49.220 - 00:26:52.024] Guest: I mean, even now.
[00:26:52.044 - 00:26:54.108] Guest: But when I get hurt.
[00:26:54.188 - 00:26:54.989] Guest: I mean, earlier I was like this.
[00:26:55.009 - 00:26:55.810] Guest: Now I have improved.
[00:26:56.592 - 00:26:57.954] Guest: Earlier I was like this.
[00:26:57.974 - 00:27:01.760] Guest: When I, when I, when I used to feel sad or when someone would break my heart or hurt me.
[00:27:03.242 - 00:27:05.906] Guest: So, as if it gets completely shuttered down.
[00:27:07.426 - 00:27:14.233] Guest: By the way, my shutter came all the way to four sides.
[00:27:14.254 - 00:27:17.437] Guest: And after that, you couldn't even reach me.
[00:27:17.457 - 00:27:21.902] Guest: Steel shutters were falling like this.
[00:27:21.922 - 00:27:25.326] Guest: So I remember that I didn't talk for three or four days.
[00:27:25.346 - 00:27:25.786] Guest: I was silent.
[00:27:25.806 - 00:27:33.955] Guest: And the other one wasn't a good thing.
[00:27:33.975 - 00:27:36.498] Guest: For example, one day Kiran and I
[00:27:37.122 - 00:27:41.787] Guest: I don't even remember what happened to my husband and wife.
[00:27:41.807 - 00:27:45.311] Guest: Something was wrong and I was very hurt by Kiran.
[00:27:45.331 - 00:27:46.613] Guest: So I stopped talking to him.
[00:27:46.633 - 00:27:52.279] Guest: Now we live in the same house, we are sleeping in the same room, we are sleeping in the same bed.
[00:27:52.299 - 00:27:55.142] Guest: But I am not answering their conversation.
[00:27:55.182 - 00:27:56.143] Guest: I am keeping them together.
[00:27:56.163 - 00:27:59.707] Guest: So I am telling them that I am not happy with them.
[00:27:59.727 - 00:28:03.692] Guest: One day it happened, two days it happened, three days it happened, four days it happened.
[00:28:04.172 - 00:28:05.554] Guest: Now the person in front of you, think about his capability.
[00:28:06.082 - 00:28:08.845] Guest: He is also very hurt that I have hurt this man's heart.
[00:28:09.286 - 00:28:10.988] Guest: And now I am trying to win him back.
[00:28:11.048 - 00:28:13.071] Guest: He is not responding.
[00:28:13.091 - 00:28:13.891] Guest: He is not responding.
[00:28:13.912 - 00:28:17.996] Guest: He is not responding at all.
[00:28:18.017 - 00:28:18.357] Guest: So hard.
[00:28:21.120 - 00:28:27.208] Guest: So the fourth day he was trying to talk to me and I was not answering at all.
[00:28:27.268 - 00:28:30.352] Guest: At one point he started crying.
[00:28:30.372 - 00:28:32.714] Guest: And he said, I don't understand what to do.
[00:28:32.734 - 00:28:34.096] Guest: You are not responding at all.
[00:28:35.598 - 00:28:35.698] Guest: Okay.
[00:28:35.842 - 00:28:41.450] Guest: The interesting thing is that at that time two emotions were running in me.
[00:28:41.530 - 00:28:44.133] Guest: One is the emotion of my anger that I will not forgive.
[00:28:44.534 - 00:28:44.794] Guest: Ego.
[00:28:46.136 - 00:28:48.099] Guest: Ego and you know deep hurt.
[00:28:48.619 - 00:28:51.103] Guest: Ego is a very right word for that.
[00:28:51.123 - 00:28:51.904] Guest: Zid.
[00:28:54.187 - 00:28:57.111] Guest: That I will not forgive.
[00:28:57.131 - 00:29:02.378] Guest: Along with that one more emotion is running in me.
[00:29:02.398 - 00:29:05.202] Guest: And that is that I am seeing that it is getting painful.
[00:29:06.082 - 00:29:12.228] Guest: And I am telling myself, what kind of foolishness is this?
[00:29:12.248 - 00:29:13.529] Guest: Leave it.
[00:29:13.549 - 00:29:13.929] Guest: Talk to me.
[00:29:13.950 - 00:29:14.810] Guest: How much are you trying?
[00:29:14.870 - 00:29:17.193] Guest: It's been four days.
[00:29:17.213 - 00:29:19.595] Guest: How can you be so stubborn?
[00:29:19.775 - 00:29:20.236] Guest: Talk to me.
[00:29:21.016 - 00:29:21.377] Guest: Leave it.
[00:29:21.437 - 00:29:24.800] Guest: I am scolding myself.
[00:29:24.820 - 00:29:25.400] Guest: But I can't do it.
[00:29:25.420 - 00:29:27.042] Guest: I am not able to take a step.
[00:29:27.062 - 00:29:29.725] Guest: I am not able to say, okay, leave it.
[00:29:29.745 - 00:29:35.410] Guest: On one hand, I am scolding myself that both things are going together.
[00:29:35.586 - 00:29:38.069] Guest: Now after therapy, I understood a lot of things.
[00:29:38.089 - 00:29:42.055] Guest: But this is my very big flaw.
[00:29:42.075 - 00:29:43.276] Guest: You said it was your red flag.
[00:29:43.336 - 00:29:45.279] Guest: This is my very big flaw.
[00:29:45.299 - 00:29:49.925] Guest: I was so hurt that I didn't forgive the other person.
[00:29:50.987 - 00:29:52.929] Guest: Juhi and I had a fight for 7 years.
[00:29:52.949 - 00:29:54.612] Guest: I didn't talk to Juhi for 7 years.
[00:29:55.172 - 00:29:57.235] Guest: While we were working together.
[00:29:57.255 - 00:29:57.576] Guest: 7 years.
[00:29:58.297 - 00:30:02.462] Guest: And I was upset about a small thing.
[00:30:02.482 - 00:30:04.265] Guest: And I didn't talk to her for 7 years.
[00:30:04.285 - 00:30:05.266] Guest: And Juhi tried a lot.
[00:30:05.442 - 00:30:12.329] Guest: I used to say to Reena, how are you doing?
[00:30:13.089 - 00:30:17.153] Guest: Meet him and kill him.
[00:30:17.393 - 00:30:17.934] Guest: No.
[00:30:18.034 - 00:30:19.175] Guest: No.
[00:30:19.575 - 00:30:19.656] Unknown: No.
[00:30:19.736 - 00:30:22.218] Guest: No.
[00:30:22.238 - 00:30:22.778] Guest: No.
[00:30:24.040 - 00:30:24.360] Guest: No.
[00:30:24.880 - 00:30:25.361] Guest: No.
[00:30:26.922 - 00:30:29.465] Host: No.
[00:30:29.485 - 00:30:30.266] Host: No.
[00:30:30.306 - 00:30:32.828] Host: No.
[00:30:32.848 - 00:30:33.148] Host: No.
[00:30:33.248 - 00:30:33.769] Host: No.
[00:30:33.809 - 00:30:34.930] Host: No.
[00:30:35.042 - 00:30:41.295] Host: whenever we get angry, we behave in that way with them.
[00:30:41.315 - 00:30:46.206] Host: The way in which we feel that we will learn more lesson from them indirectly, we do that.
[00:30:46.627 - 00:30:55.826] Host: So probably let's say you get hurt and you feel that I won't forgive him because if I forgive him so quickly, he won't understand how much he hurt me.
[00:30:56.258 - 00:30:59.123] Host: How can I say it so easily?
[00:30:59.183 - 00:31:02.008] Host: You should understand how deep it is, how bad it is.
[00:31:02.088 - 00:31:04.031] Host: You should be a little tortured.
[00:31:04.412 - 00:31:07.637] Host: And because of that, you do it once a day.
[00:31:08.439 - 00:31:12.405] Host: Then internally the brain keeps telling you that this is the right thing.
[00:31:12.425 - 00:31:13.948] Host: And then the fight starts.
[00:31:14.649 - 00:31:19.858] Host: One side of your love, you feel that it's okay, it's okay, you live forever.
[00:31:19.938 - 00:31:24.464] Host: But the other side is subconsciously, you are like... Holding on to it.
[00:31:24.844 - 00:31:28.248] Host: But Sabak, he is not the one who is getting it.
[00:31:28.268 - 00:31:28.649] Host: We are stuck.
[00:31:28.669 - 00:31:29.049] Host: Right.
[00:31:29.069 - 00:31:32.694] Host: And subconsciously do everything.
[00:31:32.754 - 00:31:32.914] Host: Right.
[00:31:32.934 - 00:31:34.296] Host: Absolutely right.
[00:31:34.316 - 00:31:37.600] Guest: No one talks, some shout, some leave, some talk.
[00:31:37.620 - 00:31:39.222] Guest: You used to ask that you get angry.
[00:31:39.242 - 00:31:40.063] Guest: I get angry, I get quiet.
[00:31:41.305 - 00:31:42.606] Guest: Isolator.
[00:31:42.626 - 00:31:43.808] Guest: Yes, I remove myself.
[00:31:43.828 - 00:31:46.471] Guest: That is my nature.
[00:31:46.491 - 00:31:47.432] Guest: I get quiet, silent.
[00:31:48.133 - 00:31:48.914] Guest: They are very dangerous.
[00:31:50.018 - 00:31:53.001] Guest: passive-aggressive.
[00:31:53.021 - 00:31:54.042] Guest: I was very passive-aggressive.
[00:31:54.062 - 00:31:56.525] Guest: Now I have improved a lot.
[00:31:56.545 - 00:31:57.546] Unknown: From where does it come from?
[00:31:57.566 - 00:31:57.927] Unknown: I don't know.
[00:31:58.087 - 00:32:01.531] Guest: It must have come from childhood.
[00:32:02.191 - 00:32:07.958] Guest: That's what most therapists tell you that your childhood boys.
[00:32:07.978 - 00:32:10.361] Guest: Your first nine years, they shape you.
[00:32:10.601 - 00:32:11.322] Guest: They shape you.
[00:32:11.342 - 00:32:14.785] Guest: So it must have come in childhood.
[00:32:14.805 - 00:32:15.346] Guest: I don't know.
[00:32:15.938 - 00:32:18.562] Guest: Although my childhood was very happy.
[00:32:19.102 - 00:32:22.787] Guest: It's been quite a happy childhood fun.
[00:32:22.827 - 00:32:26.853] Host: When you get angry or fight or something goes wrong, do you cry?
[00:32:27.553 - 00:32:28.315] Guest: I cry very easily.
[00:32:29.216 - 00:32:30.297] Host: When was the last time you cried?
[00:32:31.599 - 00:32:32.841] Guest: 5 minutes ago.
[00:32:32.861 - 00:32:34.062] Guest: At least 8-10 times a day I cry.
[00:32:34.082 - 00:32:37.767] Guest: I mean tears come out like this.
[00:32:37.787 - 00:32:40.591] Guest: I cry as easily as I can.
[00:32:40.611 - 00:32:42.834] Guest: I don't curb my emotions.
[00:32:42.854 - 00:32:45.938] Guest: If I cry, I will cry in front of you.
[00:32:46.914 - 00:32:51.439] Guest: And while discussing, I was crying for the first time, I was explaining my points to you.
[00:32:51.459 - 00:32:54.842] Guest: I won't leave that.
[00:32:54.863 - 00:32:55.383] Host: That's my place.
[00:32:55.403 - 00:32:57.726] Host: But sometimes it happens that you go alone and weep.
[00:32:57.746 - 00:32:58.246] Guest: Yes, yes.
[00:32:59.067 - 00:33:02.631] Guest: Many times.
[00:33:02.851 - 00:33:03.672] Host: When did that happen?
[00:33:04.733 - 00:33:08.617] Host: Weeks ago, months ago, years ago?
[00:33:08.777 - 00:33:13.903] Guest: If you say that my major break down of crying is over, it's been a long time.
[00:33:13.923 - 00:33:16.786] Guest: It hasn't happened in the last two years.
[00:33:18.882 - 00:33:20.925] Host: What happened, personal reason or professional?
[00:33:24.090 - 00:33:28.918] Guest: Personal, professional, I was very depressed at that time, that's all.
[00:33:28.938 - 00:33:33.606] Guest: Before that, I didn't have any such big depression with me.
[00:33:35.909 - 00:33:38.353] Host: Mostly, it was personal.
[00:33:38.373 - 00:33:45.305] Host: You have sacrificed your personal life to some extent, to a lot of extent for professional career.
[00:33:45.325 - 00:33:46.226] Host: Is there anyone in your life
[00:33:46.722 - 00:33:50.928] Host: who you can point out and be like, who sacrificed the most for you.
[00:33:50.948 - 00:33:51.148] Guest: Mother.
[00:33:52.370 - 00:33:52.710] Guest: My mother.
[00:33:53.171 - 00:33:58.919] Host: Why would you say that?
[00:33:58.939 - 00:34:14.962] Guest: I think right from childhood, and it's not just my mother, I think all mothers, their instinct, mother's instinct,
[00:34:16.738 - 00:34:23.927] Guest: The voice that comes out from inside is always for children.
[00:34:23.947 - 00:34:32.057] Guest: Their perversion, their carelessness, if they are not well then the mother will wake up at night and won't be able to sleep.
[00:34:32.117 - 00:34:34.860] Guest: Okay, if you haven't come home, you must be at 11 or 12 o'clock.
[00:34:34.880 - 00:34:36.762] Guest: The mother won't be able to sleep.
[00:34:36.783 - 00:34:39.165] Guest: Whether the son or daughter has gone out or not.
[00:34:39.185 - 00:34:39.306] Guest: No.
[00:34:39.326 - 00:34:41.528] Guest: Whether they are safe or not.
[00:34:41.548 - 00:34:44.051] Guest: No matter how sleepy they will be, they won't sleep.
[00:34:44.071 - 00:34:46.194] Guest: These sacrifices are daily sacrifices.
[00:34:46.402 - 00:34:46.923] Guest: every day.
[00:34:47.884 - 00:35:00.182] Guest: So when you are a child and you are 18 years old, the sacrifices that mother does in 18 years, we cannot compare them and we cannot even get close to her.
[00:35:01.805 - 00:35:04.429] Guest: I think, Ammi is the one who has sacrificed a lot.
[00:35:05.610 - 00:35:16.146] Guest: Not just for me, but for all the four of us, the sacrifices that Ammi has done for the four children, which for the four children,
[00:35:16.226 - 00:35:19.770] Guest: I have thought, I have lived for the children.
[00:35:20.511 - 00:35:21.953] Host: I would say my mother has done the same.
[00:35:22.574 - 00:35:27.199] Guest: They don't just think about your health, they connect with your emotions.
[00:35:27.219 - 00:35:36.811] Guest: They know what you are bothering or what you are excited about.
[00:35:36.831 - 00:35:39.494] Guest: So they know everything.
[00:35:39.514 - 00:35:43.499] Guest: Like when I was very excited in tennis, I couldn't sleep all night.
[00:35:43.519 - 00:35:45.842] Guest: The next day is a match, so I couldn't sleep all night.
[00:35:46.114 - 00:35:47.936] Guest: I can't sleep when the release comes.
[00:35:48.036 - 00:35:48.617] Guest: That excitement.
[00:35:49.057 - 00:35:53.061] Guest: So when I used to go for a match, my mother knew that the whole focus was on the match.
[00:35:53.082 - 00:36:01.290] Guest: So after the match, when I used to go back in the evening, my mother used to be waiting for me.
[00:36:01.891 - 00:36:03.573] Guest: It never happened that someone else opened the door.
[00:36:03.593 - 00:36:04.554] Guest: Not a chance.
[00:36:05.375 - 00:36:07.097] Guest: My mother opened the door instead of my watch.
[00:36:07.117 - 00:36:08.338] Guest: What happened?
[00:36:08.358 - 00:36:09.539] Unknown: I won or lost.
[00:36:09.559 - 00:36:10.140] Guest: First question.
[00:36:11.842 - 00:36:12.963] Guest: And I remember an incident.
[00:36:12.983 - 00:36:14.885] Guest: I have said it many times.
[00:36:14.905 - 00:36:15.826] Guest: Let me tell you the truth.
[00:36:16.834 - 00:36:20.037] Guest: It had a deep impact on me.
[00:36:20.057 - 00:36:24.381] Guest: So my mother used to ask me, what happened?
[00:36:24.401 - 00:36:26.343] Host: I used to win.
[00:36:26.383 - 00:36:26.543] Guest: Okay.
[00:36:26.563 - 00:36:27.444] Guest: So I used to say, yes, I won.
[00:36:27.464 - 00:36:28.405] Guest: Thank God.
[00:36:28.425 - 00:36:31.068] Guest: She used to give me a hug.
[00:36:31.088 - 00:36:32.669] Guest: And my mother loved tea.
[00:36:32.689 - 00:36:34.231] Guest: So we were used to making tea since childhood.
[00:36:34.471 - 00:36:40.517] Guest: So we used to make tea and we used to sit and drink tea.
[00:36:40.577 - 00:36:42.619] Guest: One day I came home and my mother asked what happened?
[00:36:42.639 - 00:36:43.800] Guest: I said, yes, I won.
[00:36:43.820 - 00:36:45.281] Guest: Thank God.
[00:36:45.301 - 00:36:45.842] Guest: We used to drink tea.
[00:36:46.722 - 00:37:07.965] Guest: sitting in the hall and mother said, suddenly out of the blue, thinking, thinking, that the boy you played with today, he must have just reached home and his mother must have asked him to win or lose, he would have said, I lost.
[00:37:08.005 - 00:37:11.609] Guest: So at this time, his mother must have felt bad.
[00:37:11.629 - 00:37:12.370] Unknown: This mother said,
[00:37:14.498 - 00:37:23.428] Guest: I was so shocked to hear that I thought that the guy who lost to me must have gone home and his mother must be feeling bad.
[00:37:23.548 - 00:37:25.710] Guest: Suddenly I was thinking that I did not do anything wrong.
[00:37:25.730 - 00:37:27.832] Guest: Suddenly I was also feeling bad.
[00:37:27.852 - 00:37:30.275] Guest: His mother must be feeling bad right now.
[00:37:30.795 - 00:37:36.061] Guest: Then I saw my mother and thought, where did she get this thought from?
[00:37:36.081 - 00:37:39.345] Guest: She did not even know the name of the guy.
[00:37:39.585 - 00:37:40.846] Guest: Neither did she see his face.
[00:37:42.648 - 00:37:44.370] Guest: So this quality in the mother.
[00:37:45.730 - 00:37:51.359] Guest: that the other person's pain can be understood and captured very quickly.
[00:37:51.399 - 00:37:52.201] Guest: It's caring.
[00:37:52.862 - 00:37:54.705] Guest: Every person has different intelligences.
[00:37:55.146 - 00:38:00.414] Guest: The intelligence of caring is very much in the mother.
[00:38:00.955 - 00:38:03.780] Guest: So her mind automatically went there.
[00:38:04.080 - 00:38:07.225] Guest: That there is a mother like me who must be feeling bad at this time.
[00:38:07.245 - 00:38:10.331] Guest: She is feeling bad for that mother.
[00:38:10.351 - 00:38:11.212] Guest: The one who she didn't even see.
[00:38:11.392 - 00:38:12.434] Guest: The one whose name she doesn't even know.
[00:38:13.602 - 00:38:15.805] Guest: That incident had a very deep impact on me.
[00:38:15.845 - 00:38:17.888] Guest: I think it was when I was 11 years old.
[00:38:17.908 - 00:38:20.111] Guest: I couldn't forget that incident.
[00:38:21.293 - 00:38:22.274] Guest: And that has stayed with me.
[00:38:22.995 - 00:38:24.437] Guest: And that was a big lesson she taught me.
[00:38:24.477 - 00:38:27.221] Guest: I don't think she was even teaching me lessons.
[00:38:27.241 - 00:38:28.483] Guest: She was actually sharing her thoughts.
[00:38:28.503 - 00:38:33.550] Guest: And while sharing her thoughts, I realized that my mother said something very important.
[00:38:33.590 - 00:38:38.557] Guest: So I didn't learn from that day that no one should be saddened.
[00:38:38.577 - 00:38:41.842] Guest: And...
[00:38:41.986 - 00:38:43.609] Guest: You should think about every person.
[00:38:43.629 - 00:38:45.432] Guest: We often think that we are right.
[00:38:45.532 - 00:38:46.975] Guest: No, I should say this.
[00:38:46.995 - 00:38:47.676] Guest: But what is it?
[00:38:47.696 - 00:38:51.502] Guest: Think about the other person too.
[00:38:51.522 - 00:38:53.866] Guest: Every person has his own emotions.
[00:38:55.269 - 00:38:56.351] Guest: Do whatever you want to do.
[00:38:56.371 - 00:38:56.872] Guest: Don't hurt anyone.
[00:38:56.892 - 00:39:01.419] Guest: This is a very big mistake that Ammi had given me.
[00:39:01.640 - 00:39:03.102] Host: Have you ever hurt someone?
[00:39:03.122 - 00:39:04.104] Guest: Unknowingly unknowingly?
[00:39:04.164 - 00:39:06.909] Guest: No, I have hurt someone.
[00:39:06.989 - 00:39:07.570] Guest: No one is like that.
[00:39:08.866 - 00:39:11.109] Guest: It can be said that I have never hurt anyone's heart.
[00:39:11.309 - 00:39:13.211] Guest: Knowingly or unknowingly?
[00:39:13.231 - 00:39:13.972] Guest: Sometimes knowingly.
[00:39:14.633 - 00:39:15.514] Guest: Sometimes unknowingly.
[00:39:17.557 - 00:39:18.158] Guest: Yes, this is the truth.
[00:39:18.979 - 00:39:19.679] Host: Knowingly for?
[00:39:19.740 - 00:39:22.964] Host: Because you are obsessed with what?
[00:39:22.984 - 00:39:23.664] Guest: Different reasons.
[00:39:23.865 - 00:39:27.810] Guest: Sometimes you have to do some things that you should not know.
[00:39:27.830 - 00:39:30.893] Guest: But at that time you do it.
[00:39:32.395 - 00:39:37.161] Guest: Then later you realize that you should not have done that.
[00:39:37.181 - 00:39:37.842] Guest: My mother used to say
[00:39:38.242 - 00:39:40.245] Guest: that a person is the son of mistakes.
[00:39:42.167 - 00:39:46.813] Guest: I still remember the memories of my mother.
[00:39:46.833 - 00:39:48.375] Guest: I had a better mind than my friend.
[00:39:48.395 - 00:39:50.978] Guest: You know, she used to say all these one-liners.
[00:39:52.480 - 00:39:53.261] Guest: They have stayed with me.
[00:40:00.910 - 00:40:06.898] Guest: Sometimes silence actually says a lot.
[00:40:08.994 - 00:40:09.355] Guest: So, yeah.
[00:40:11.358 - 00:40:16.365] Host: You know, when you were talking about my mom, I couldn't understand one thing about my mom.
[00:40:16.806 - 00:40:21.373] Host: And I think she must be with every mom.
[00:40:21.393 - 00:40:24.498] Host: I live here in Mumbai.
[00:40:24.518 - 00:40:27.663] Host: I have never been able to go without a surprise.
[00:40:27.683 - 00:40:27.763] Unknown: Oh!
[00:40:27.883 - 00:40:32.370] Host: Whenever I try to give a surprise, I didn't have time to stand at my mom's door.
[00:40:33.026 - 00:40:35.228] Host: He had an instinct that I am coming.
[00:40:35.448 - 00:40:37.010] Host: I don't know how she comes to know.
[00:40:37.450 - 00:40:39.552] Host: And I used to think that...
[00:40:39.573 - 00:40:40.694] Host: Surprise this time.
[00:40:40.714 - 00:40:41.434] Host: Surprise this time.
[00:40:41.494 - 00:40:44.597] Host: My mom used to sleep at 10 o'clock in the night.
[00:40:44.638 - 00:40:46.760] Guest: Once I woke up at 11.30 or 12 o'clock in the night.
[00:40:47.681 - 00:40:48.662] Host: Now the surprise... Oh!
[00:40:48.682 - 00:40:50.283] Host: I was thinking that you are coming.
[00:40:50.463 - 00:40:51.925] Host: Just see.
[00:40:52.025 - 00:40:54.227] Host: Once in the morning at 7 o'clock I am going home.
[00:40:54.247 - 00:40:56.069] Host: And my mom wakes up at 7.30 or 7.30.
[00:40:57.050 - 00:40:59.672] Host: But then it starts a little late in our house.
[00:40:59.692 - 00:41:01.234] Host: It starts at 9 o'clock.
[00:41:01.954 - 00:41:04.217] Host: At 7.30 pm, my mom was standing there.
[00:41:04.237 - 00:41:06.540] Host: I thought she was praying at home.
[00:41:06.560 - 00:41:09.364] Host: She said, I was doing it early and I thought... You will come.
[00:41:09.464 - 00:41:10.346] Guest: You will come.
[00:41:12.148 - 00:41:13.370] Host: I don't know how this happens.
[00:41:13.630 - 00:41:18.737] Host: Beautiful that she is able to do something like this.
[00:41:18.757 - 00:41:23.003] Host: You did movies, you do a lot of movies on parenting.
[00:41:23.905 - 00:41:23.985] Unknown: Yes.
[00:41:24.005 - 00:41:24.926] Guest: As it has turned out.
[00:41:24.986 - 00:41:26.328] Host: It has turned out.
[00:41:26.348 - 00:41:27.730] Guest: I didn't think about it but it has happened.
[00:41:28.098 - 00:41:29.740] Host: Two movies I will talk about specifically.
[00:41:30.501 - 00:41:33.484] Host: One is Dangal and one is 3DX.
[00:41:33.525 - 00:41:34.686] Host: Both have a parenting style.
[00:41:35.267 - 00:41:40.613] Guest: And there is parenting on Tariz B. I will talk about two.
[00:41:40.633 - 00:41:42.275] Host: They have opposite styles.
[00:41:42.295 - 00:41:43.196] Host: One is 3DX.
[00:41:43.216 - 00:41:45.719] Host: One has a very authoritarian style.
[00:41:45.739 - 00:41:46.901] Host: Which is Dangal.
[00:41:47.261 - 00:41:51.346] Host: That I will decide, I will be disciplined, I will be hard.
[00:41:51.810 - 00:41:52.831] Host: Children are trained.
[00:41:52.851 - 00:41:54.373] Host: Children are trained to be disciplined.
[00:41:54.393 - 00:41:56.195] Host: One thing is to leave the children to do whatever they want to do.
[00:41:56.235 - 00:41:57.337] Host: This is the message of the movie.
[00:41:57.357 - 00:41:58.899] Host: If you don't let them do it, then the children.
[00:41:58.919 - 00:42:00.941] Host: Because in the end, the virus realizes this.
[00:42:01.021 - 00:42:01.281] Host: Correct.
[00:42:01.442 - 00:42:02.523] Host: You have to give them freedom.
[00:42:02.543 - 00:42:02.843] Host: Freedom.
[00:42:03.244 - 00:42:05.206] Host: So there is a permissive authority.
[00:42:05.366 - 00:42:07.689] Host: So it is in a completely different style.
[00:42:08.550 - 00:42:11.314] Host: Which is better according to you?
[00:42:11.334 - 00:42:18.963] Guest: See, it often happens that when we work in films, my personal thought is not the character's thought.
[00:42:19.383 - 00:42:21.586] Guest: Okay.
[00:42:21.890 - 00:42:26.055] Guest: So my thinking is that we should give freedom to children.
[00:42:26.075 - 00:42:29.799] Guest: Every child has its own character, it has its own qualities.
[00:42:30.359 - 00:42:34.284] Guest: And we often stop children from doing evil.
[00:42:34.304 - 00:42:36.306] Guest: No, children should do evil.
[00:42:36.326 - 00:42:37.748] Guest: That is their period of doing evil.
[00:42:39.249 - 00:42:43.414] Guest: So, a little rebellion should take place in the child.
[00:42:43.434 - 00:42:44.675] Guest: He should discover himself.
[00:42:44.695 - 00:42:48.740] Guest: He will learn by making his own mistakes.
[00:42:48.760 - 00:42:50.642] Guest: If we keep killing him, then he will become like a robot.
[00:42:51.906 - 00:42:54.188] Guest: So I feel that we shouldn't control the children.
[00:42:54.208 - 00:42:55.610] Guest: They should learn properly.
[00:42:55.630 - 00:42:55.950] Guest: Believe me.
[00:42:56.530 - 00:43:01.595] Guest: And when the children are very young, sometimes they don't understand the right and the wrong.
[00:43:01.635 - 00:43:02.957] Guest: So you are there as a parent.
[00:43:03.757 - 00:43:07.541] Guest: But they should let go of the bind large that they are following their passion.
[00:43:07.561 - 00:43:09.363] Guest: They should understand their passion.
[00:43:12.065 - 00:43:13.607] Guest: Everything should not be disciplined.
[00:43:15.749 - 00:43:17.571] Guest: Otherwise, the child becomes stifled.
[00:43:17.591 - 00:43:18.772] Guest: You stop his growth.
[00:43:20.073 - 00:43:21.074] Guest: So I feel that.
[00:43:21.218 - 00:43:24.983] Guest: So I believe in the philosophy of three dates.
[00:43:25.003 - 00:43:25.464] Guest: Personally.
[00:43:25.624 - 00:43:27.026] Guest: Not in Dangalwali.
[00:43:27.827 - 00:43:30.630] Guest: But I didn't have a choice in Dangalwali.
[00:43:30.731 - 00:43:31.752] Guest: We were making a real story.
[00:43:32.072 - 00:43:40.103] Guest: Mahavir forgot the relationship of Mahavir Ji with Geeta and Bhagita.
[00:43:40.123 - 00:43:41.765] Guest: We had to show that to us.
[00:43:41.785 - 00:43:42.666] Guest: I can't put my theory in it.
[00:43:42.686 - 00:43:44.108] Guest: I am playing Mahavir's character.
[00:43:44.449 - 00:43:45.250] Guest: So I have to be Mahavir.
[00:43:47.052 - 00:43:48.594] Guest: And we also show that
[00:43:48.866 - 00:43:56.558] Guest: Her dream was to fulfill her dream through her children.
[00:43:56.578 - 00:43:57.259] Guest: Which is not true.
[00:43:58.120 - 00:44:01.445] Guest: I believe that, but that was what we wanted to show.
[00:44:01.485 - 00:44:15.346] Guest: Secondly, when you create champions like Selena, Williams and her sister, Venus Williams,
[00:44:15.490 - 00:44:18.254] Guest: His father trained him since he was a child to become a tennis star.
[00:44:18.434 - 00:44:22.781] Guest: He was crazy since he was a child.
[00:44:22.861 - 00:44:29.891] Guest: Now, what happens to him is that when you put so much pressure on a child at such a young age, then there can be two things.
[00:44:29.991 - 00:44:35.580] Guest: Either the child will crack, crumble, or he will break.
[00:44:35.600 - 00:44:38.804] Guest: Or he will become like the fruit of the apple.
[00:44:38.824 - 00:44:42.610] Guest: Meaning, the more pressure he is putting, the more pressure he is putting and getting stronger.
[00:44:42.946 - 00:44:44.428] Guest: both of them are the same thing.
[00:44:44.448 - 00:44:49.834] Guest: So champions are finally made like William's sister or Geeta and Babita.
[00:44:50.515 - 00:44:59.225] Guest: And those kids who were worried in the beginning that the father is doing a lot of injustice for the father's health.
[00:44:59.245 - 00:45:06.274] Guest: But at one point they also realized that his crazyness has actually given us a whole life, helped us whole life.
[00:45:06.294 - 00:45:09.938] Guest: And at that time there was a different time.
[00:45:11.522 - 00:45:13.985] Guest: There were a lot of things that were not allowed for girls.
[00:45:14.005 - 00:45:20.675] Guest: So Mr. Mahavir's madness was that he said that if I put the girls in the kitchen, they will fight with the boys.
[00:45:20.695 - 00:45:24.520] Guest: Such an unique vision is madness in a way.
[00:45:25.401 - 00:45:29.086] Guest: So, yes.
[00:45:29.106 - 00:45:30.768] Guest: So, I think that...
[00:45:30.788 - 00:45:32.611] Guest: It becomes a champion.
[00:45:32.631 - 00:45:32.951] Guest: Sometimes.
[00:45:33.853 - 00:45:34.794] Guest: Not every time.
[00:45:34.814 - 00:45:35.915] Guest: It's not like that.
[00:45:36.056 - 00:45:37.778] Guest: Champions come themselves.
[00:45:38.146 - 00:45:40.469] Host: I am seeing something from Yuvraj Singh.
[00:45:40.489 - 00:45:42.472] Host: So, Yograj Ji was also like that.
[00:45:42.492 - 00:45:42.712] Host: Yes.
[00:45:42.872 - 00:45:44.154] Host: Very hard and tough.
[00:45:44.514 - 00:45:44.634] Host: Yes.
[00:45:44.654 - 00:45:46.777] Host: He also put a lot of pressure on Yuvraj.
[00:45:46.797 - 00:45:48.880] Host: Do you think you should make him a sports star?
[00:45:48.900 - 00:45:49.701] Guest: No.
[00:45:49.781 - 00:45:53.706] Guest: Actually, I don't think you should do that.
[00:45:53.726 - 00:45:56.370] Guest: What we have shown in Dangal is not my nature.
[00:45:56.390 - 00:45:56.570] Guest: Okay.
[00:45:56.670 - 00:45:56.991] Guest: Not at all.
[00:45:57.011 - 00:46:05.842] Guest: I think if you want to encourage a kid in a sport, then increase his excitement.
[00:46:06.370 - 00:46:07.391] Guest: But don't rely on your own thinking.
[00:46:07.471 - 00:46:10.294] Guest: I don't believe in these things.
[00:46:10.314 - 00:46:14.559] Guest: But in Dangal, we had the same story, we had to do the same.
[00:46:15.020 - 00:46:16.021] Guest: So I had to deal with that truthfully.
[00:46:17.002 - 00:46:24.410] Guest: Often in the character, the characters we are dealing with, sometimes your thinking and the character's thinking are different.
[00:46:24.931 - 00:46:25.531] Guest: With some point.
[00:46:25.551 - 00:46:29.856] Guest: But you have to follow the character's thinking as an actor.
[00:46:29.876 - 00:46:30.958] Guest: You can't put your thinking in it.
[00:46:31.478 - 00:46:34.962] Host: You spoke about father, mother, siblings.
[00:46:35.042 - 00:46:37.825] Host: How is the relationship with your siblings?
[00:46:37.845 - 00:46:44.113] Guest: Actually, my relationship... My brother Faisal, Nikhat and Farhat, we are four.
[00:46:45.555 - 00:46:47.577] Guest: I think from childhood, we have been very close.
[00:46:48.238 - 00:46:50.281] Guest: And we've been very comfortable.
[00:46:51.522 - 00:46:55.407] Guest: And with each other, interacting with each other.
[00:46:55.447 - 00:46:56.188] Guest: And we are very close.
[00:46:56.869 - 00:46:58.631] Guest: Nikhat, Farhat, Faisal and I, all four of us.
[00:46:59.192 - 00:47:00.373] Host: Is there something special in you?
[00:47:00.413 - 00:47:01.134] Host: Have you ever thought of it?
[00:47:02.416 - 00:47:04.178] Guest: I mean, when I was in 12th grade,
[00:47:04.258 - 00:47:11.569] Guest: When I was in college, my friend was around my age, so I was not graduating.
[00:47:11.649 - 00:47:15.876] Guest: It's not today.
[00:47:15.896 - 00:47:18.039] Guest: It was pre-3rd year.
[00:47:18.140 - 00:47:18.620] Guest: Before 85.
[00:47:18.780 - 00:47:26.152] Guest: When I left college in 1983, education was a big deal.
[00:47:27.133 - 00:47:30.098] Guest: If you were not a graduate, your life would have ended.
[00:47:32.002 - 00:47:33.424] Guest: And I wasn't scared of it at all.
[00:47:33.444 - 00:47:34.405] Guest: I thought, this is a graduation.
[00:47:34.485 - 00:47:35.947] Guest: Is it a certificate?
[00:47:36.728 - 00:47:38.090] Guest: I don't want to take it from this.
[00:47:38.891 - 00:47:40.313] Guest: Actually, I was a Rancho type from the beginning.
[00:47:41.174 - 00:47:43.357] Guest: This is the thinking of Rancho.
[00:47:44.279 - 00:47:47.803] Guest: And one of the big reasons that Raju wanted me in the film was because of my thinking.
[00:47:47.964 - 00:47:49.285] Guest: That is my belief as well.
[00:47:49.446 - 00:47:50.147] Guest: That is who you are.
[00:47:50.167 - 00:47:50.848] Guest: That is who I am.
[00:47:51.649 - 00:47:51.869] Guest: You know?
[00:47:52.550 - 00:47:54.513] Host: I fully agree with the thought.
[00:47:55.013 - 00:47:58.598] Host: I'm too young to even maybe validate this theory.
[00:47:58.658 - 00:48:01.522] Host: But I agree with the thought that...
[00:48:02.178 - 00:48:04.321] Host: It was an impractical decision, right?
[00:48:04.521 - 00:48:04.621] Unknown: Yes.
[00:48:04.641 - 00:48:05.482] Host: We make some right decisions.
[00:48:05.502 - 00:48:06.984] Host: Because they come from instinct.
[00:48:07.085 - 00:48:07.485] Host: Correct.
[00:48:07.505 - 00:48:09.047] Guest: I have to do this.
[00:48:09.067 - 00:48:13.633] Guest: You see, when I had applied, all the people around me said, I don't know what is going on.
[00:48:13.653 - 00:48:15.936] Guest: There is no film on cricket till date.
[00:48:15.956 - 00:48:16.737] Guest: Cricket is not there.
[00:48:17.078 - 00:48:18.279] Guest: There is no film on sports till date.
[00:48:18.300 - 00:48:24.388] Guest: I don't know if there is a film of a period in which all the gangsters are wandering in the dhoti.
[00:48:24.408 - 00:48:28.613] Guest: At that time, all the films that were successful, they were shooting in Switzerland.
[00:48:28.633 - 00:48:30.456] Guest: Broad shooting was going on.
[00:48:30.476 - 00:48:32.178] Guest: DKNY and brands are going to wear.
[00:48:34.370 - 00:48:40.597] Guest: When I did Tariz Ami, when I did Rangde Basanti, Rangde Basanti was the fifth remake of Bhagat Singh and Azad.
[00:48:42.038 - 00:48:46.703] Guest: It was the fifth remake, meaning in the period of one and a half years.
[00:48:46.723 - 00:48:52.850] Guest: A sony and Bobby had come, Ajay Devgan had come, and Sonu Sood had come, I don't remember.
[00:48:52.870 - 00:48:54.672] Guest: There were many films on that topic.
[00:48:54.692 - 00:48:55.813] Guest: So, we were making the fifth remake.
[00:48:55.833 - 00:48:58.356] Guest: There is absolutely no practical.
[00:48:58.376 - 00:49:00.178] Guest: What are you going to do?
[00:49:03.141 - 00:49:04.082] Guest: Tariz Ami,
[00:49:04.514 - 00:49:07.579] Guest: So these were all impractical decisions.
[00:49:07.619 - 00:49:22.001] Guest: When I did Dangal and I became fat, I remember that when I met someone in the industry, we are usually busy in our work that we don't meet each other so frequently.
[00:49:22.021 - 00:49:30.194] Guest: So when I met someone in the industry, when he was looking at me, he looked at me in his eyes.
[00:49:31.138 - 00:49:33.822] Guest: He used to think that he has become so fat.
[00:49:33.842 - 00:49:35.244] Guest: Oh my God!
[00:49:35.264 - 00:49:35.564] Guest: He went.
[00:49:36.385 - 00:49:37.907] Guest: He went to Amir Khan.
[00:49:37.927 - 00:49:38.788] Guest: In his last film.
[00:49:40.150 - 00:49:42.834] Guest: He will never come back.
[00:49:42.854 - 00:49:45.417] Guest: I was very fat.
[00:49:45.437 - 00:49:50.304] Guest: And I was happy because I felt the shock on his face that...
[00:49:52.086 - 00:49:52.527] Guest: He went.
[00:49:52.547 - 00:49:53.448] Guest: He didn't look at me.
[00:49:53.468 - 00:49:57.674] Guest: I have taken so many risky decisions.
[00:49:59.055 - 00:50:00.978] Guest: But I thought he was right.
[00:50:01.122 - 00:50:04.366] Guest: I used to think that's what I wanted to do.
[00:50:04.387 - 00:50:06.329] Guest: So all my decisions are impractical actually.
[00:50:06.910 - 00:50:07.631] Guest: That's the best.
[00:50:07.651 - 00:50:08.572] Guest: I have taken them in my crazy mind.
[00:50:09.594 - 00:50:11.196] Guest: And luckily they have proven right.
[00:50:11.216 - 00:50:16.784] Guest: So I am very thankful that it has gone right so far.
[00:50:16.844 - 00:50:19.968] Host: I say this a lot of times in my team.
[00:50:20.008 - 00:50:22.111] Host: The worst advice I have gotten is be practical.
[00:50:24.234 - 00:50:27.218] Guest: I have a very deadly example of this.
[00:50:27.490 - 00:50:29.973] Guest: We came to the film Rangde Basanti.
[00:50:29.993 - 00:50:31.415] Guest: There is a scene where I cry while eating.
[00:50:32.276 - 00:50:33.397] Guest: Bhaidaji is attacked.
[00:50:33.778 - 00:50:36.421] Guest: Latichaj is at the India gate.
[00:50:36.741 - 00:50:39.164] Guest: She is in hospital, she is in coma.
[00:50:39.244 - 00:50:40.285] Guest: And I come back with the soup.
[00:50:40.306 - 00:50:41.947] Guest: We have some packet packets in our hands.
[00:50:41.988 - 00:50:43.289] Guest: We sit.
[00:50:43.309 - 00:50:47.234] Guest: Everything has become a mess.
[00:50:47.254 - 00:50:48.175] Guest: And I try to eat the food.
[00:50:48.195 - 00:50:49.857] Guest: And suddenly I get thoughts.
[00:50:49.877 - 00:50:51.299] Guest: And I start talking.
[00:50:51.319 - 00:50:51.659] Guest: I cry.
[00:50:52.040 - 00:50:55.023] Guest: That scene was very important for me.
[00:50:55.043 - 00:50:56.365] Guest: It was very difficult for me.
[00:50:56.385 - 00:50:57.266] Guest: Because it was a long scene.
[00:50:57.410 - 00:50:59.413] Guest: When I come, I am in a particular mood.
[00:50:59.433 - 00:51:05.621] Guest: And then while talking, you start crying.
[00:51:05.661 - 00:51:13.732] Guest: So the technical support we get that you put glissin or do this, I don't have all that.
[00:51:13.752 - 00:51:15.614] Guest: I actually have to perform a single shot.
[00:51:15.634 - 00:51:21.022] Guest: So I did a lot of rehearsal in my mind.
[00:51:21.042 - 00:51:21.722] Guest: Okay.
[00:51:21.742 - 00:51:24.666] Guest: How will I do it?
[00:51:25.327 - 00:51:27.410] Guest: And I thought, how will I do that scene?
[00:51:28.226 - 00:51:31.811] Guest: One day we broke down and everything was fixed.
[00:51:31.831 - 00:51:36.197] Guest: Rakesh, Meera and I were DOP Vinod.
[00:51:36.217 - 00:51:38.360] Guest: And everything was set.
[00:51:40.323 - 00:51:41.584] Guest: The next day we were going to shoot that scene.
[00:51:41.604 - 00:51:45.149] Guest: The next day when I came on shooting, the clothes were different.
[00:51:45.169 - 00:51:47.533] Guest: I told the assistant that these clothes are continually wrong.
[00:51:49.175 - 00:51:51.518] Guest: He said, no sir, we are not shooting that scene.
[00:51:51.578 - 00:51:53.621] Guest: We are shooting the other one.
[00:51:53.781 - 00:51:54.322] Guest: I said, why?
[00:51:55.682 - 00:51:57.864] Guest: Then he said, no, it's Mehra, call Mehra.
[00:51:58.005 - 00:52:01.048] Guest: So Mehra came, I said, Mehra, the scene is ready, let's shoot.
[00:52:01.408 - 00:52:03.331] Guest: And I was absolutely ready, emotionally.
[00:52:03.351 - 00:52:06.775] Guest: I was ready to shake the glass.
[00:52:06.795 - 00:52:10.999] Guest: Then he said, no, he was saying that if we start with that, then we are going to suffer for a day and a half.
[00:52:11.580 - 00:52:12.841] Guest: In the lighting shift.
[00:52:14.343 - 00:52:20.570] Guest: So that's why we are starting with the second scene.
[00:52:20.951 - 00:52:23.954] Guest: My first step in the industry is as an assistant director.
[00:52:25.474 - 00:52:31.180] Guest: So scheduling, I used to do all this.
[00:52:31.240 - 00:52:36.586] Guest: So when he called me, I thought the producer is calling me, it will make a difference in a day and a half.
[00:52:37.928 - 00:52:44.055] Guest: As an actor, whether I do it today or after three days, I should do it well if I am a professional.
[00:52:46.898 - 00:52:49.741] Guest: So I said, okay, come on, let's do it like this.
[00:52:49.941 - 00:52:51.523] Guest: So there was a second scene.
[00:52:51.543 - 00:52:54.066] Guest: After three days, we shot that scene.
[00:52:54.146 - 00:52:57.029] Guest: But it was mis-timed.
[00:52:57.049 - 00:52:58.831] Guest: I couldn't do that scene.
[00:52:58.851 - 00:53:01.013] Guest: Like I had thought, I will do it.
[00:53:01.033 - 00:53:02.874] Guest: It has a diluted version.
[00:53:02.955 - 00:53:04.796] Guest: Okay.
[00:53:04.816 - 00:53:09.241] Guest: Now whenever I go somewhere, people say, that scene was your amazing scene.
[00:53:09.801 - 00:53:13.064] Guest: Rangde Vasintika, who you kept crying while eating.
[00:53:13.084 - 00:53:13.925] Guest: And I was so angry.
[00:53:13.985 - 00:53:16.688] Guest: I think I did that scene so badly.
[00:53:16.728 - 00:53:20.431] Guest: What I wanted to do, it didn't happen to them.
[00:53:20.451 - 00:53:21.432] Guest: So I was very irritated.
[00:53:22.914 - 00:53:23.154] Guest: But...
[00:53:23.266 - 00:53:24.087] Guest: People liked it.
[00:53:24.107 - 00:53:26.311] Guest: Yes, but it could have been better.
[00:53:26.371 - 00:53:26.992] Guest: It couldn't be magic.
[00:53:27.032 - 00:53:27.232] Guest: No.
[00:53:27.312 - 00:53:28.875] Guest: It couldn't be magic.
[00:53:28.895 - 00:53:34.263] Guest: So, at that time, I got a big lesson.
[00:53:34.884 - 00:53:35.745] Guest: What?
[00:53:35.765 - 00:53:43.096] Guest: At that time, I should have told Mehra that, listen, I have to do this scene in a day and a half.
[00:53:43.116 - 00:53:49.306] Guest: On that day and today, as an assistant, I keep my instinct aside.
[00:53:49.967 - 00:53:50.147] Guest: No.
[00:53:50.828 - 00:53:52.050] Guest: First of all,
[00:53:53.442 - 00:53:54.404] Guest: importance.
[00:53:54.424 - 00:53:58.310] Guest: If you are ready to do one thing, if you are emotionally ready, then do it.
[00:53:58.330 - 00:54:01.575] Guest: After two days, you will be able to go.
[00:54:01.595 - 00:54:05.822] Guest: So, I have come with a practical decision.
[00:54:05.842 - 00:54:06.804] Guest: Till today.
[00:54:06.824 - 00:54:09.809] Guest: Till today, I have come with a practical decision.
[00:54:10.049 - 00:54:12.733] Guest: So, what I am impractical is right.
[00:54:12.753 - 00:54:15.037] Guest: I have tried to become practical.
[00:54:15.057 - 00:54:16.460] Guest: It is not right.
[00:54:16.480 - 00:54:20.466] Guest: See, there is a truth of a moment.
[00:54:21.634 - 00:54:26.819] Guest: And in that moment, the truth of that moment, you should give respect to it.
[00:54:26.839 - 00:54:28.181] Guest: Don't be practical to it.
[00:54:29.222 - 00:54:33.626] Guest: Accept the truth of that moment and follow it.
[00:54:34.547 - 00:54:35.128] Guest: That's what I feel.
[00:54:36.869 - 00:54:39.492] Guest: Even though you must be impractical at that time.
[00:54:40.513 - 00:54:41.274] Guest: Follow your instinct.
[00:54:42.935 - 00:54:43.796] Guest: Your mother's instinct.
[00:54:44.297 - 00:54:45.738] Host: Yeah.
[00:54:45.758 - 00:54:46.359] Host: Very strong.
[00:54:46.879 - 00:54:47.900] Guest: She's following her instinct.
[00:54:48.421 - 00:54:49.522] Guest: She's not following logic.
[00:54:50.914 - 00:54:51.915] Guest: She's not following data.
[00:54:53.057 - 00:54:53.898] Guest: She's following instinct.
[00:54:55.701 - 00:54:56.562] Guest: And she's never gone wrong.
[00:54:57.483 - 00:54:58.925] Guest: So, she's never gone wrong.

[00:55:17.474 - 00:55:39.724] Guest: There have been a host of all of us.
[00:55:41.366 - 00:55:47.474] Guest: This generation of ours, which has come in late 80s, actually generation
[00:55:47.650 - 00:55:49.653] Guest: Not just Salman Shah Rukh and me.
[00:55:49.673 - 00:55:56.020] Guest: We are many people who have been working for 35 years, which is not normal, by the way.
[00:55:56.040 - 00:55:56.841] Guest: And everyone has given big hits.
[00:55:56.862 - 00:56:02.709] Guest: Everyone has given big hits and everything is very successful.
[00:56:02.729 - 00:56:04.251] Guest: So I want to correct this.
[00:56:04.591 - 00:56:07.214] Host: But why do you think then there is this, that you three have more names?
[00:56:07.234 - 00:56:16.466] Guest: Because it is possible that in our film more numbers have been broken or we have done more business with some other film.
[00:56:16.674 - 00:56:23.625] Guest: Tusharukh and Salman and there is always a competition between me and Salman.
[00:56:23.645 - 00:56:26.829] Guest: But this is not a competition for me.
[00:56:26.849 - 00:56:32.859] Guest: We are doing work that is reaching people's hearts.
[00:56:32.879 - 00:56:36.624] Guest: We reach people's hearts and feel their emotions.
[00:56:36.644 - 00:56:40.370] Guest: What is the competition in that?
[00:56:40.994 - 00:56:43.197] Guest: When I see Shah Rukh's work, I like it.
[00:56:43.277 - 00:56:44.779] Guest: I also laugh, I also cry.
[00:56:44.799 - 00:56:46.742] Guest: Now what should I complain?
[00:56:46.782 - 00:56:48.945] Guest: He is doing a good job.
[00:56:48.965 - 00:56:49.686] Guest: I also talk about Salman.
[00:56:49.706 - 00:56:54.614] Guest: When I saw Sanjay Dutt, Munna Bhai, I was so impressed.
[00:56:54.654 - 00:56:59.981] Guest: Sanjun has done such a good job.
[00:57:00.662 - 00:57:02.625] Guest: So, I am interested in good work.
[00:57:02.645 - 00:57:03.967] Guest: Who is doing it, I am not interested in it.
[00:57:04.247 - 00:57:05.229] Guest: But what's special in you?
[00:57:05.269 - 00:57:06.130] Guest: What do you think?
[00:57:06.370 - 00:57:07.451] Guest: Let me tell you about my qualities.
[00:57:07.831 - 00:57:10.935] Guest: The things I believe in, I get behind them.
[00:57:10.955 - 00:57:12.716] Guest: Then I don't stay practical.
[00:57:12.737 - 00:57:16.620] Guest: I won't be angry.
[00:57:17.361 - 00:57:24.008] Guest: I approach work with honesty.
[00:57:24.028 - 00:57:24.869] Guest: I am not tired.
[00:57:24.889 - 00:57:27.231] Guest: I am not a thief.
[00:57:27.291 - 00:57:28.372] Guest: I am not tired.
[00:57:28.393 - 00:57:33.778] Guest: I don't leave anything to be better.
[00:57:35.906 - 00:57:37.368] Guest: So this is my good quality.
[00:57:37.609 - 00:57:45.262] Guest: I look at my work from a good point of view.
[00:57:45.282 - 00:57:52.213] Guest: Usually, the work of myself doesn't look good or bad.
[00:57:52.233 - 00:57:53.235] Guest: But it's not like that with me.
[00:57:53.255 - 00:57:56.340] Guest: When I look at my work, I can see that I have done something wrong here.
[00:57:57.362 - 00:57:58.504] Guest: I am a very good self-critic.
[00:57:59.265 - 00:57:59.906] Guest: I am very real.
[00:57:59.926 - 00:58:02.130] Guest: I don't fool myself.
[00:58:02.850 - 00:58:04.872] Guest: That's a great script.
[00:58:04.892 - 00:58:07.255] Guest: I tell you the truth, I'm a fighter here.
[00:58:07.275 - 00:58:09.577] Guest: I couldn't lift this weight.
[00:58:09.637 - 00:58:12.881] Guest: So I have to lift this weight next time.
[00:58:12.921 - 00:58:16.205] Guest: So back to the gym.
[00:58:16.225 - 00:58:17.366] Guest: Do you understand?
[00:58:17.386 - 00:58:23.933] Guest: So I'm very real about my flaws and I follow my passion and I give it all.
[00:58:23.953 - 00:58:26.155] Guest: I'm not tired, I'm not even scared.
[00:58:26.996 - 00:58:28.498] Guest: So these are my good qualities.
[00:58:29.026 - 00:58:34.635] Guest: Now, was my time right or was my luck right that those things were right?
[00:58:34.655 - 00:58:36.858] Guest: Everything was binding at the right time.
[00:58:36.918 - 00:58:42.968] Guest: Otherwise, we would have discussed today how big a failure a person is.
[00:58:42.988 - 00:58:43.488] Guest: Nothing went wrong.
[00:58:43.508 - 00:58:45.091] Guest: My way of working is the same.
[00:58:45.111 - 00:58:46.733] Host: I am working the same way.
[00:58:46.754 - 00:58:50.319] Host: Now you were talking and you were talking Khans.
[00:58:50.720 - 00:58:52.242] Host: Do you guys compete internally?
[00:58:52.802 - 00:58:54.004] Host: No longer.
[00:58:54.064 - 00:58:55.125] Guest: I don't think any longer.
[00:58:55.145 - 00:58:56.327] Host: No, no, no.
[00:58:56.687 - 00:58:58.370] Host: Outside, I don't know, world, whatever.
[00:58:58.410 - 00:59:01.013] Guest: Actually, at one time, we used to compete, I think.
[00:59:02.355 - 00:59:02.635] Guest: On what?
[00:59:03.296 - 00:59:05.319] Guest: On what?
[00:59:05.339 - 00:59:05.740] Guest: On what?
[00:59:05.840 - 00:59:06.341] Guest: On what?
[00:59:07.462 - 00:59:08.604] Guest: On what?
[00:59:09.265 - 00:59:10.166] Guest: On what?
[00:59:10.186 - 00:59:11.428] Guest: On what?
[00:59:11.768 - 00:59:12.709] Guest: On what?
[00:59:12.729 - 00:59:13.150] Guest: On what?
[00:59:13.170 - 00:59:13.510] Guest: On what?
[00:59:13.570 - 00:59:17.155] Guest: On what?
[00:59:17.256 - 00:59:17.496] Guest: On what?
[00:59:18.417 - 00:59:20.039] Guest: On what?
[00:59:21.161 - 00:59:22.002] Guest: On what?
[00:59:22.178 - 00:59:26.082] Guest: I don't believe in negativity.
[00:59:26.102 - 00:59:28.125] Guest: I mean, I didn't go there.
[00:59:28.245 - 00:59:32.209] Guest: Negative things don't happen at all.
[00:59:32.229 - 00:59:39.097] Guest: So, competition, from my side and from my understanding, has always been healthy.
[00:59:39.137 - 00:59:43.001] Guest: That I see that he has done such a good film, he has done such a good work.
[00:59:43.021 - 00:59:44.763] Guest: I have to do good too.
[00:59:44.783 - 00:59:46.405] Guest: I am inspired by other people's work.
[00:59:46.425 - 00:59:48.367] Guest: But I don't feel sad because of his success.
[00:59:48.427 - 00:59:51.090] Guest: I feel happy because of his success.
[00:59:51.874 - 00:59:54.978] Guest: So for me, he never had such a competition.
[00:59:56.020 - 00:59:59.625] Guest: And now we have been together for 35 years.
[01:00:00.967 - 01:00:11.982] Guest: Not only Salman Charok and me, but in the industry, all the actors and actresses have a long relationship with us all.
[01:00:12.002 - 01:00:16.488] Guest: So, I think it was never for me.
[01:00:16.508 - 01:00:20.914] Guest: I was never competing with anyone in a real sense.
[01:00:21.538 - 01:00:26.705] Guest: I was always competing with myself.
[01:00:26.885 - 01:00:30.610] Guest: I didn't want to take Dilwale Dulenia as a romantic movie.
[01:00:30.810 - 01:00:32.312] Guest: Because I like that movie.
[01:00:32.492 - 01:00:33.713] Guest: Shahrukh did a great job.
[01:00:33.734 - 01:00:35.235] Guest: I like it a lot.
[01:00:35.255 - 01:00:36.677] Guest: I also enjoy watching it.
[01:00:38.019 - 01:00:39.321] Guest: So I am competing with him.
[01:00:39.721 - 01:00:42.084] Host: But you said you could compete in the 90s.
[01:00:42.104 - 01:00:42.445] Host: A little bit.
[01:00:42.505 - 01:00:44.227] Host: I think in each one.
[01:00:44.287 - 01:00:45.148] Host: Which way do you compete?
[01:00:45.248 - 01:00:46.149] Host: Competition meaning what?
[01:00:47.171 - 01:00:49.874] Guest: I guess each one wanted to be slightly ahead than the other.
[01:00:50.466 - 01:00:52.389] Host: And what would you do to make sure that you are ahead?
[01:00:52.509 - 01:00:52.849] Host: Nothing.
[01:00:52.969 - 01:00:54.311] Guest: I would just try and work.
[01:00:54.331 - 01:00:55.673] Guest: I would just try and do good work.
[01:00:55.693 - 01:00:56.094] Guest: Okay.
[01:00:56.114 - 01:00:57.235] Guest: I would just try and do good work.
[01:00:57.436 - 01:01:00.660] Guest: So it was more that I am always competing with myself.
[01:01:00.740 - 01:01:04.545] Guest: That I have to go 10 steps ahead of the previous work.
[01:01:04.565 - 01:01:07.830] Guest: I have to learn from the previous work and move forward.
[01:01:08.090 - 01:01:11.495] Host: In 90s only, you were telling me a story outside.
[01:01:11.515 - 01:01:13.357] Host: That Shah Rukh Khan gave you a laptop.
[01:01:13.397 - 01:01:14.519] Host: Yes, Shah Rukh.
[01:01:14.559 - 01:01:16.021] Host: He gave you it in the middle of competition.
[01:01:18.584 - 01:01:19.826] Guest: No, look.
[01:01:20.322 - 01:01:33.497] Guest: I think there's a lot of warmth and respect that we have for each other.
[01:01:33.517 - 01:01:35.499] Guest: And there's a healthy competition too.
[01:01:35.539 - 01:01:36.661] Guest: Every person wants to do better.
[01:01:39.664 - 01:01:45.010] Guest: But when we were on the show, Shah Rukh and I, in 1996, I was telling that technologically,

[01:02:19.527 - 01:02:21.350] Guest: I said, I don't have a laptop.
[01:02:21.370 - 01:02:23.313] Guest: I haven't used it so far.
[01:02:23.493 - 01:02:24.775] Guest: What are you talking about?
[01:02:24.795 - 01:02:28.581] Guest: I haven't used a laptop.
[01:02:28.601 - 01:02:29.142] Guest: It's very important.
[01:02:29.242 - 01:02:31.926] Guest: So he said, whatever I'm buying, I'll buy it for you.
[01:02:31.946 - 01:02:33.208] Guest: So that you can start too.
[01:02:33.228 - 01:02:34.509] Guest: You should get tech savvy.
[01:02:35.731 - 01:02:38.876] Guest: He said, okay, whatever you buy for yourself, buy it for me.
[01:02:38.896 - 01:02:41.079] Guest: So he did a lot of research.
[01:02:41.620 - 01:02:44.624] Guest: At that time, there was a model number of Toshiba.
[01:02:44.644 - 01:02:45.746] Guest: I don't know which one was the latest.
[01:02:47.202 - 01:02:50.026] Guest: He tried to convince me that he is a fake.
[01:02:50.046 - 01:02:51.187] Guest: He convinced me.
[01:02:51.207 - 01:02:52.269] Guest: He said, don't convince me.
[01:02:52.289 - 01:02:52.609] Guest: I don't know.
[01:02:52.629 - 01:02:55.893] Guest: Anyway, whatever he thinks is right.
[01:02:55.913 - 01:03:01.360] Guest: So he bought a computer with great love and uploaded some things on it.
[01:03:01.380 - 01:03:01.941] Guest: He installed it.
[01:03:01.961 - 01:03:04.344] Guest: Yes, he installed it.
[01:03:04.605 - 01:03:06.928] Guest: Office and Excel and all that time.
[01:03:06.948 - 01:03:09.631] Guest: I don't know what was going on.
[01:03:09.711 - 01:03:11.433] Guest: He can organize his calendar.
[01:03:12.074 - 01:03:13.436] Guest: My calendar is here.
[01:03:13.456 - 01:03:15.058] Guest: I have never done it.
[01:03:15.938 - 01:03:25.472] Guest: So he did it very lovingly and he gave me a brand new laptop with all his papers and a nice case.
[01:03:25.492 - 01:03:27.395] Guest: It's about 1996.
[01:03:27.575 - 01:03:31.040] Guest: We came back to India.
[01:03:33.063 - 01:03:34.284] Guest: It's been four years.
[01:03:34.305 - 01:03:38.130] Guest: And then I had a manager who told me that he needed to buy me a laptop.
[01:03:39.586 - 01:03:40.327] Guest: for work.
[01:03:40.427 - 01:03:43.391] Guest: But I noticed that you have a laptop that you don't use.
[01:03:43.411 - 01:03:44.172] Guest: Can I use it?
[01:03:44.192 - 01:03:45.774] Guest: So I said, which laptop?
[01:03:45.794 - 01:03:47.215] Guest: I forgot that I had a laptop.
[01:03:47.235 - 01:03:51.601] Guest: He said, that Toshiba's laptop is lying in a drawer.
[01:03:51.641 - 01:03:52.582] Guest: Show it to me.
[01:03:52.602 - 01:03:54.625] Guest: I said, oh, Shah Rukh bought it for me.
[01:03:54.645 - 01:03:59.290] Guest: I haven't used it for four years.
[01:03:59.310 - 01:04:00.312] Guest: I haven't turned it on.
[01:04:00.332 - 01:04:03.295] Guest: I haven't turned it on for the first time.
[01:04:05.418 - 01:04:05.458] Unknown: So
[01:04:05.922 - 01:04:09.927] Guest: I said, yes, yes, use it, I am not using it anyway.
[01:04:09.947 - 01:04:16.436] Guest: You won't believe that the laptop didn't get on because it was lying there for 4 years.
[01:04:16.456 - 01:04:18.239] Guest: I don't know what had happened in it.
[01:04:18.259 - 01:04:19.000] Guest: It didn't get on for 4 years.
[01:04:19.600 - 01:04:20.221] Guest: Then it didn't get on.
[01:04:20.241 - 01:04:21.182] Host: I want to talk about money.
[01:04:21.243 - 01:04:21.643] Host: Yes.
[01:04:21.663 - 01:04:29.514] Host: What is the point where you are like money is not enough, money doesn't matter.
[01:04:29.534 - 01:04:31.857] Guest: Actually, I was like this from the start.
[01:04:31.877 - 01:04:35.181] Guest: I am not interested in money from the start.
[01:04:35.201 - 01:04:35.762] Guest: And there is no
[01:04:35.842 - 01:04:38.426] Guest: I will not be able to tell you the reason because I was not even a teacher.
[01:04:38.826 - 01:04:43.172] Guest: So when I started working, I was more focused on my creativity.
[01:04:43.272 - 01:04:46.436] Host: From day one to today.
[01:04:47.958 - 01:04:55.989] Guest: If you ask me how much money I have at this time, I will not be able to answer you.
[01:04:56.009 - 01:05:02.278] Guest: And if you ask me where my money is invested, I have no idea.
[01:05:02.358 - 01:05:02.418] Unknown: And
[01:05:02.690 - 01:05:05.774] Guest: I am in loss or profit at the moment, I don't even know that.
[01:05:06.996 - 01:05:08.878] Guest: I don't have an idea.
[01:05:08.918 - 01:05:10.380] Guest: I have a man named Bimal Parik.
[01:05:10.621 - 01:05:14.866] Guest: He is my step mother.
[01:05:16.068 - 01:05:16.989] Guest: He is not a step mother.
[01:05:18.251 - 01:05:20.354] Guest: He is a mother because he worries me a lot.
[01:05:20.374 - 01:05:24.579] Guest: But he is a step mother, so he tortures me a lot.
[01:05:24.599 - 01:05:27.884] Guest: And he is with me from the beginning of my career.
[01:05:28.404 - 01:05:30.067] Guest: He is my chartered accountant.
[01:05:30.087 - 01:05:32.690] Guest: So he takes care of the money.
[01:05:33.314 - 01:05:34.356] Guest: He manages it.
[01:05:34.376 - 01:05:37.762] Guest: I don't even know what he does with the money.
[01:05:37.782 - 01:05:42.010] Guest: If Bimal wants to cancel me in today's date, he will do it in a second.
[01:05:42.030 - 01:05:43.653] Guest: I won't be able to stop him.
[01:05:45.576 - 01:05:46.458] Guest: I trust him 100%.
[01:05:47.820 - 01:05:50.886] Guest: And he looks after all that for me.
[01:05:50.926 - 01:05:52.749] Guest: He doesn't have it.
[01:05:52.769 - 01:05:54.432] Guest: And I don't care.
[01:05:54.472 - 01:05:57.618] Host: So when old relationships end, you are different here.
[01:05:58.626 - 01:06:04.255] Host: After that, at what point emotionally you are ready or you know that I can go into the next relationship?
[01:06:05.577 - 01:06:07.419] Host: How do you decide that?
[01:06:07.439 - 01:06:09.983] Guest: There is no timing for that.
[01:06:10.063 - 01:06:12.627] Guest: I never even thought about it.
[01:06:12.647 - 01:06:21.420] Guest: The relationship ends when it has ended a long time ago.
[01:06:24.425 - 01:06:27.730] Guest: Actually, the relationship has changed.
[01:06:27.842 - 01:06:30.045] Guest: There is a change in it.
[01:06:30.266 - 01:06:36.034] Guest: And you and your partner later realize that we have actually come a long way.
[01:06:36.074 - 01:06:38.678] Guest: This has already been shifted.
[01:06:38.698 - 01:06:39.379] Host: Why did I ask?
[01:06:39.399 - 01:06:40.401] Host: Because I saw your clip.
[01:06:40.421 - 01:06:42.203] Host: Yes, which one?
[01:06:42.424 - 01:06:46.289] Host: There was a clip where you said that now I will not get married.
[01:06:46.309 - 01:06:46.390] Unknown: Yes.
[01:06:46.410 - 01:06:49.234] Host: Because I think now I am 59, so I don't want to do it.
[01:06:49.254 - 01:06:50.696] Guest: Correct, correct, correct.
[01:06:50.716 - 01:06:51.597] Host: I thought so.
[01:06:52.258 - 01:06:54.261] Host: So what changed in today and in the last time?
[01:06:55.583 - 01:06:57.426] Guest: Gauri, I got that.
[01:06:58.082 - 01:07:04.410] Guest: Because at that time I thought that I am old now.
[01:07:04.430 - 01:07:08.014] Guest: Now where will I find someone at this age?
[01:07:08.034 - 01:07:09.456] Guest: Until then my therapy also started.
[01:07:10.317 - 01:07:15.523] Guest: So I understood that actually I have to make myself healthy.
[01:07:15.603 - 01:07:18.006] Guest: And what I love first is to do it myself.
[01:07:18.927 - 01:07:20.790] Guest: Self-love and self-respect.
[01:07:21.130 - 01:07:24.434] Guest: And I started focusing on that.
[01:07:26.594 - 01:07:34.021] Guest: And at that time, I thought that I would tell my friends that I have two very deep relationships with Reena and Kiran.
[01:07:35.062 - 01:07:37.304] Guest: And we are still very close, we are still friends.
[01:07:37.324 - 01:07:41.248] Guest: We still have a lot of respect in our hearts for each other.
[01:07:44.691 - 01:07:49.015] Guest: Now, I don't think that I will find someone else with whom I will become a bond.
[01:07:49.035 - 01:07:52.018] Guest: I don't think so.
[01:07:52.118 - 01:07:54.280] Guest: I have worked for 58, 59.
[01:07:54.340 - 01:07:55.321] Guest: I said, who will I meet now?
[01:07:55.341 - 01:07:56.402] Guest: So this was in my mind.
[01:07:56.514 - 01:07:56.835] Guest: No, no.
[01:07:57.536 - 01:07:58.697] Guest: There will be a lot of people interested.
[01:07:58.718 - 01:08:04.106] Guest: Two, three years back, I had felt that, who am I?
[01:08:04.126 - 01:08:17.688] Guest: So, by mistake, actually, Gauri and I met and we were connected and we had a great friendship, a great love, a great respect.
[01:08:17.708 - 01:08:18.749] Guest: So, it happened.
[01:08:18.769 - 01:08:19.390] Guest: I never had a plan.
[01:08:19.450 - 01:08:21.714] Guest: In fact, I thought, okay, now I have
[01:08:22.082 - 01:08:23.884] Guest: I have children, mother, siblings.
[01:08:23.904 - 01:08:25.105] Guest: I have such close relations.
[01:08:25.125 - 01:08:26.786] Guest: I don't need a partner.
[01:08:27.127 - 01:08:28.088] Guest: Actually, I don't need one.
[01:08:28.708 - 01:08:31.651] Guest: Because my other relations are so healthy.
[01:08:32.972 - 01:08:37.156] Guest: Kiran, Reena and I still work together in the Water Foundation.
[01:08:37.176 - 01:08:41.040] Guest: And we sit together every day and talk.
[01:08:41.060 - 01:08:47.386] Guest: And we have a genuine love and love for each other.
[01:08:48.047 - 01:08:48.627] Guest: As a family.
[01:08:49.148 - 01:08:51.410] Guest: I think Reena and I and Kiran and I always
[01:08:51.842 - 01:08:53.664] Guest: family will be there.
[01:08:53.684 - 01:08:56.107] Guest: Husband, wife, maybe they won't be there, but we will be family always.
[01:08:57.850 - 01:09:03.897] Guest: They are a part of my family, a part of my life.
[01:09:03.917 - 01:09:05.739] Guest: So that will never change.
[01:09:06.300 - 01:09:07.622] Guest: But I felt like you are right.
[01:09:07.642 - 01:09:13.089] Guest: Two years ago, maybe now I don't have a relationship that is so deep.
[01:09:13.169 - 01:09:20.658] Guest: And from that, I mean, I had even considered that now maybe I am not like that.
[01:09:21.442 - 01:09:23.905] Guest: But then I was surprised.
[01:09:24.465 - 01:09:26.228] Host: But did you feel lonely at any point?
[01:09:26.248 - 01:09:27.329] Guest: No.
[01:09:27.349 - 01:09:28.090] Guest: I have to say no.
[01:09:28.951 - 01:09:30.112] Guest: I've got a very close family.
[01:09:31.113 - 01:09:36.599] Guest: And I've also been so close to cinema.
[01:09:36.619 - 01:09:39.182] Guest: That has been my strongest relationship.
[01:09:39.202 - 01:09:41.365] Guest: One of my strongest relationship has been with cinema.
[01:09:42.767 - 01:09:48.413] Guest: So that relationship is the most important relationship for me till 4 years ago.
[01:09:48.433 - 01:09:49.234] Guest: So you...
[01:09:49.346 - 01:09:52.311] Guest: There was no bandwidth, there was no space to think, is there anything missing?
[01:09:52.331 - 01:09:57.040] Guest: You are going to Raftar, you don't find anything missing.
[01:09:57.060 - 01:10:07.119] Guest: Like Kiran and my manager separated, we are so close to each other that after almost every two or three days, we used to meet.
[01:10:09.022 - 01:10:13.330] Guest: I remember we had a divorce, we were shooting Lalsing.
[01:10:15.138 - 01:10:16.099] Guest: in Ladakh.
[01:10:16.279 - 01:10:18.342] Guest: The sequence of Kargil was going on.
[01:10:18.903 - 01:10:24.069] Guest: And there was a village nearby where there was a celebration going on which they invited us.
[01:10:24.710 - 01:10:27.733] Guest: So they made us dance and Kiran and I were also dancing.
[01:10:28.554 - 01:10:33.480] Guest: So that video must have come somewhere on social media.
[01:10:33.781 - 01:10:39.968] Guest: So many people commented that they got divorced, they were dancing together and looking very happy.
[01:10:39.988 - 01:10:44.614] Guest: I can't explain to people that my relationship is very deep with Kiran.
[01:10:44.634 - 01:10:44.914] Guest: And we
[01:10:45.058 - 01:10:46.820] Guest: We are family.
[01:10:49.444 - 01:10:51.967] Guest: He supported me a lot in the whole of Lal Singh.
[01:10:52.208 - 01:10:54.811] Guest: I supported him a lot in the whole of Lapatah Ladies.
[01:10:56.453 - 01:10:58.216] Guest: So...
[01:10:58.236 - 01:10:59.477] Host: Very healthy relationship.
[01:10:59.497 - 01:11:00.338] Guest: Yeah.
[01:11:00.358 - 01:11:01.800] Guest: So I've not felt lonely.
[01:11:01.900 - 01:11:02.682] Guest: I don't think I have.
[01:11:03.382 - 01:11:04.945] Guest: That's what I'm answering.
[01:11:05.986 - 01:11:09.451] Host: And you said that people think wrong.
[01:11:09.471 - 01:11:10.612] Host: People can't explain to people.
[01:11:10.832 - 01:11:11.513] Host: You see some line.
[01:11:12.955 - 01:11:15.058] Host: Sometimes whatever you do...
[01:11:15.810 - 01:11:21.519] Host: What do you think is the biggest misunderstanding about America?
[01:11:21.539 - 01:11:27.269] Guest: Oh, I can't think of anything that is very big, which I think people don't understand me.
[01:11:27.569 - 01:11:28.430] Guest: No, they do.
[01:11:28.450 - 01:11:29.652] Host: You feel completely understood?
[01:11:30.193 - 01:11:30.774] Host: By and large.
[01:11:31.535 - 01:11:33.258] Host: People around you?
[01:11:33.439 - 01:11:35.722] Guest: No, it's always my problem with Bimal.
[01:11:35.782 - 01:11:39.528] Guest: Bimal doesn't understand me.
[01:11:39.568 - 01:11:40.350] Guest: What is it?
[01:11:40.370 - 01:11:42.994] Guest: His mind only takes money.
[01:11:43.458 - 01:11:50.468] Guest: So he thinks that every step of mine should be practical and that gives us more money.
[01:11:50.528 - 01:11:56.157] Guest: He keeps on telling me that I don't do ads.
[01:11:57.879 - 01:11:59.181] Guest: You don't do films.
[01:11:59.201 - 01:12:02.246] Guest: You keep on telling me not to do more work.
[01:12:02.266 - 01:12:03.267] Guest: You are doing this wrong.
[01:12:03.307 - 01:12:07.754] Guest: So what he tells me, I don't think he understood me.
[01:12:07.774 - 01:12:10.738] Guest: Because when I was actually winning,
[01:12:11.970 - 01:12:14.774] Guest: At that time, I was doing about five ads.
[01:12:15.275 - 01:12:17.258] Guest: I was a brand ambassador for five products.
[01:12:19.922 - 01:12:27.634] Guest: So I thought that when I am bringing such an important topic on television, in Satyam Ajay, we are taking different, very sensitive topics.
[01:12:27.654 - 01:12:30.038] Guest: So this is what I want.
[01:12:30.218 - 01:12:33.604] Guest: It is not practical, but I am not practicing from an angle.
[01:12:33.624 - 01:12:35.126] Guest: This is what I want.
[01:12:35.146 - 01:12:37.810] Guest: Okay, when I am so deep
[01:12:38.594 - 01:12:43.120] Guest: I am talking about important things, so I don't want people to watch my ads on TV.
[01:12:43.140 - 01:12:45.803] Guest: Just now, I was telling about Kanya Brunataka.
[01:12:45.823 - 01:12:50.149] Guest: Now, someone is selling a car, someone is selling a phone, someone is selling a watch.
[01:12:50.169 - 01:12:54.594] Guest: There is no wrong in this.
[01:12:54.614 - 01:12:55.395] Guest: That is also work.
[01:12:55.415 - 01:13:00.141] Guest: And the things I am recommending as a brand ambassador, I believe in those things.
[01:13:00.161 - 01:13:01.263] Guest: Till then, I don't endorse anything.
[01:13:01.463 - 01:13:03.225] Guest: Till then, I am not sure that I will use it.
[01:13:04.247 - 01:13:06.930] Guest: So, I am not doing anything wrong, but I didn't feel right.
[01:13:09.378 - 01:13:14.226] Guest: I thought that this show is very important, it shouldn't have all this.
[01:13:14.246 - 01:13:14.907] Guest: It should be clean.
[01:13:14.927 - 01:13:19.173] Guest: So I told Bimal, my five endorsements are to terminate me, to stop me.
[01:13:19.233 - 01:13:20.335] Guest: So he was very angry.
[01:13:22.178 - 01:13:24.221] Guest: He scolded me a lot.
[01:13:24.301 - 01:13:26.164] Guest: He said, you are doing this.
[01:13:27.967 - 01:13:33.535] Guest: You know, you must have had a very big loss.
[01:13:33.555 - 01:13:35.038] Guest: I had a very big loss too.
[01:13:35.058 - 01:13:35.218] Unknown: But I...
[01:13:36.514 - 01:13:44.005] Guest: and I said to my five clients, sorry, I didn't make any mistake, I didn't make any mistake.
[01:13:44.566 - 01:13:46.849] Guest: The work I am doing doesn't suit me emotionally.
[01:13:46.889 - 01:13:49.593] Guest: I won't be able to do it.
[01:13:49.633 - 01:13:52.257] Guest: So you forgive me but you terminate it.
[01:13:52.297 - 01:13:53.639] Guest: So they understood, they terminated it.
[01:13:54.801 - 01:13:59.768] Guest: They also understood that I don't have any feelings against them.
[01:13:59.908 - 01:14:02.452] Guest: I am doing it for some other reason.
[01:14:02.472 - 01:14:04.115] Guest: But there was a lot of confusion.
[01:14:04.135 - 01:14:06.418] Guest: So often people think that I live in Siddhi, where do I study?
[01:14:06.978 - 01:14:09.502] Guest: Amir Khan earned a lot in 70s and 70s.
[01:14:09.582 - 01:14:11.445] Guest: Actually, I was very poor in 70s.
[01:14:11.625 - 01:14:15.591] Guest: Money wise.
[01:14:15.611 - 01:14:18.355] Guest: If you compare with money, then I am very poor.
[01:14:18.736 - 01:14:21.340] Guest: But value and respect wise.
[01:14:21.640 - 01:14:24.424] Guest: No, but what I got to learn, is unworthy.
[01:14:24.444 - 01:14:34.820] Guest: I have come close to my country, my relationship with the people of my country.
[01:14:34.840 - 01:14:36.082] Guest: I am connected to the family.
[01:14:37.634 - 01:14:43.259] Guest: And I have completely understood the emotions of people.
[01:14:43.279 - 01:14:52.388] Guest: How big our country is, what things are happening in it, how people are living, what are their problems, what are their dreams.
[01:14:52.408 - 01:15:06.101] Guest: What I have understood in these four years when I lived in Satya, that I have done three seasons, what I have got to learn from it, that is very important to me.
[01:15:06.121 - 01:15:07.602] Guest: I have made so many relationships with people.
[01:15:09.922 - 01:15:12.345] Guest: I have got a chance to meet so many amazing people.
[01:15:12.845 - 01:15:20.053] Guest: So many amazing people have shared their emotional, low life with me on a public platform.
[01:15:20.814 - 01:15:22.636] Guest: That is a big thing.
[01:15:22.656 - 01:15:29.744] Guest: So I feel that I get a lot of benefit from it.
[01:15:29.764 - 01:15:38.994] Guest: But a person like Bimal gets a loss that you have lost so much of your 100 crores in these 4 years.
[01:15:39.106 - 01:15:40.768] Host: You said you got a lot of things to learn.
[01:15:41.870 - 01:15:52.703] Host: If you had to pinpoint one brutal truth that you have learned in so much of your life, what is it that maybe young Amir Khan will laugh at that you are learning today?
[01:15:52.724 - 01:15:55.087] Host: That life doesn't go like this.
[01:15:56.128 - 01:16:05.340] Guest: Actually, I think the biggest thing that I got in Satya Mejwani is that I am sensitized.
[01:16:05.360 - 01:16:07.122] Guest: I am sensitized with a lot of things.
[01:16:07.778 - 01:16:20.410] Guest: about our country, about our people's life, about that, I am sensitized and I have understood a lot of things.
[01:16:20.430 - 01:16:34.504] Guest: The most sad thing that happened to me was that during research, there were a lot of things that we understood that how can a person do this?
[01:16:34.524 - 01:16:37.106] Guest: With another person,
[01:16:37.634 - 01:16:39.256] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:39.276 - 01:16:40.437] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:42.039 - 01:16:43.160] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:43.681 - 01:16:47.726] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:47.746 - 01:16:49.107] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:49.428 - 01:16:51.630] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:51.650 - 01:16:52.912] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:52.932 - 01:16:54.674] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:54.694 - 01:16:56.976] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:58.158 - 01:16:59.800] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:16:59.820 - 01:17:02.282] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:17:02.302 - 01:17:05.426] Guest: How can you be so cruel?
[01:17:06.882 - 01:17:09.585] Guest: It was very important for me.
[01:17:10.166 - 01:17:22.900] Guest: One of the biggest lessons I had learned during my life was that we have to move ahead with one another.
[01:17:23.521 - 01:17:25.723] Guest: You and me.
[01:17:25.743 - 01:17:26.164] Guest: No one else.
[01:17:26.184 - 01:17:28.647] Guest: We are the same.
[01:17:28.867 - 01:17:30.749] Guest: No one else.
[01:17:30.809 - 01:17:32.711] Guest: We are the same.
[01:17:32.751 - 01:17:34.994] Guest: And this philosophy of Advaita,
[01:17:35.362 - 01:17:36.283] Guest: Non-duality.
[01:17:36.343 - 01:17:37.044] Guest: Everything is one.
[01:17:38.326 - 01:17:39.447] Guest: The whole universe is one.
[01:17:40.088 - 01:17:41.450] Guest: It's something I actually believe in.
[01:17:42.411 - 01:17:42.591] Guest: Now.
[01:17:43.112 - 01:17:43.673] Guest: Now I believe.
[01:17:43.893 - 01:17:44.594] Guest: Everything is one.
[01:17:45.295 - 01:17:46.236] Guest: We can't see it.
[01:17:46.276 - 01:17:48.719] Guest: We can't see it.
[01:17:48.739 - 01:17:49.660] Guest: We can't understand it.
[01:17:49.681 - 01:17:50.642] Guest: Our mind can't understand it.
[01:17:50.682 - 01:17:51.783] Guest: But we are all connected.
[01:17:51.803 - 01:17:55.909] Guest: We are connected with stars and we are the same.
[01:17:55.929 - 01:18:03.218] Guest: So in the whole process I got to learn a lot about how human nature works.
[01:18:03.746 - 01:18:09.515] Guest: How can we do the most cruel thing and the best thing?
[01:18:09.535 - 01:18:20.691] Guest: So it is important that when you meet someone, you destroy his goodness.
[01:18:21.272 - 01:18:21.873] Guest: Badness.
[01:18:23.015 - 01:18:27.742] Guest: You either ignore the badness, or feel that he did not even feel bad.
[01:18:27.842 - 01:18:33.170] Guest: Like when we were actually doing it, it was a very difficult show.
[01:18:33.442 - 01:18:34.664] Guest: were taking sensitive topics.
[01:18:34.684 - 01:18:42.495] Guest: And when our first discussion took place, the core team, we were together in the core team.
[01:18:42.515 - 01:18:46.200] Guest: And as things were coming out in the research, obviously you get angry too.
[01:18:46.220 - 01:18:52.388] Guest: So everyone in the team was saying, we will show it like this, we will say it openly.
[01:18:52.589 - 01:18:53.690] Guest: He was very angry in the group.
[01:18:53.710 - 01:18:55.373] Guest: He was very angry.
[01:18:55.393 - 01:18:56.795] Guest: And he was natural.
[01:18:56.895 - 01:19:02.162] Guest: So I stopped him at that time and said, we are also starting a show.
[01:19:04.002 - 01:19:09.470] Guest: So before we move on, I want to ask a very important question.
[01:19:09.490 - 01:19:12.034] Guest: Why are we doing this show?
[01:19:12.054 - 01:19:16.822] Guest: And what is your primary emotion for this show?
[01:19:16.842 - 01:19:21.569] Guest: What is the first emotion that you want to show?
[01:19:21.589 - 01:19:26.957] Guest: If he is angry, then your show will be of one kind.
[01:19:26.977 - 01:19:29.641] Guest: I am not getting angry at this show.
[01:19:29.661 - 01:19:32.626] Guest: This show came out of my mind and I want to tell you that I am not getting angry.
[01:19:33.346 - 01:19:37.951] Guest: I am doing it with love.
[01:19:37.971 - 01:19:42.616] Guest: I have a genuine love for my country and people.
[01:19:42.636 - 01:19:45.940] Guest: And when I see that our lives can be better than this, we are not able to understand anything.
[01:19:45.960 - 01:19:49.624] Guest: So I am doing it with love.
[01:19:49.644 - 01:19:51.426] Guest: I am not doing this show in anger.
[01:19:52.347 - 01:19:53.909] Guest: So my primary emotion is love.
[01:19:55.751 - 01:19:58.834] Guest: And all of us need to be tuned into that primary emotion.
[01:19:59.394 - 01:20:04.942] Guest: Because if I am angry, then my whole show will be different.
[01:20:04.962 - 01:20:08.407] Guest: I am doing this show with love.
[01:20:08.468 - 01:20:11.853] Guest: So if I am saying anything, I am also included in it.
[01:20:12.213 - 01:20:14.577] Guest: I am not sitting on top.
[01:20:14.617 - 01:20:15.718] Guest: I am also included in that pain.
[01:20:15.738 - 01:20:16.820] Guest: I am also included in that issue.
[01:20:16.840 - 01:20:18.342] Guest: Let me give you an example.
[01:20:18.362 - 01:20:21.006] Guest: We have talked about dowry on our issue.
[01:20:22.488 - 01:20:28.978] Guest: Now you think that 90% of India has either given dowry or taken dowry or both.
[01:20:30.018 - 01:20:31.160] Guest: Roughly.
[01:20:31.180 - 01:20:33.282] Guest: I am saying something wrong.
[01:20:33.302 - 01:20:36.527] Guest: There is a huge number of people in India who take dowry even today.
[01:20:36.547 - 01:20:38.069] Guest: In some form, all the other.
[01:20:38.269 - 01:20:46.721] Guest: The TV they are watching, maybe 90% of them are in dowry.
[01:20:48.143 - 01:20:54.251] Guest: Now you think that I am saying to the public, 90% of what they are doing, I am saying that this is not right.
[01:20:54.271 - 01:20:56.674] Guest: It is wrong.
[01:20:56.694 - 01:20:59.298] Guest: What will happen if I say it in anger?
[01:20:59.318 - 01:20:59.378] Unknown: No.
[01:21:00.162 - 01:21:03.666] Guest: I am also a part of that problem.
[01:21:03.686 - 01:21:07.610] Guest: I want to see that from this perspective.
[01:21:07.630 - 01:21:10.093] Guest: And I want to speak lovingly to my people.
[01:21:10.133 - 01:21:11.955] Guest: That sometimes I make a mistake.
[01:21:12.035 - 01:21:14.538] Guest: If I pay attention to this, I will realize that this is not right.
[01:21:16.660 - 01:21:17.982] Guest: It is a question of a girl's life.
[01:21:19.384 - 01:21:24.549] Guest: So when you speak lovingly, what is your intention in front of you?
[01:21:24.569 - 01:21:25.590] Guest: Why are you speaking?
[01:21:25.611 - 01:21:27.753] Guest: Are you telling me to show me down?
[01:21:27.793 - 01:21:27.853] Unknown: No.
[01:21:27.873 - 01:21:28.754] Guest: I am not telling you to show me down.
[01:21:29.730 - 01:21:32.453] Guest: I want this country to move forward.
[01:21:33.234 - 01:21:35.015] Guest: I want this country to be better.
[01:21:35.035 - 01:21:36.917] Guest: I am coming with love.
[01:21:37.798 - 01:21:45.065] Guest: So that thing will reflect in your work.
[01:21:45.086 - 01:21:48.789] Guest: And the person who is watching your show will go to his heart.
[01:21:48.809 - 01:21:49.670] Guest: You can't fool him.
[01:21:49.690 - 01:21:50.691] Guest: You are the public boss.
[01:21:51.672 - 01:21:52.733] Guest: You can't fool him.
[01:21:52.753 - 01:21:54.615] Guest: He will understand what his intentions are.
[01:21:56.237 - 01:21:57.458] Guest: In a second, the man will understand.
[01:21:58.338 - 01:22:00.200] Guest: So that was a very important discussion for us.
[01:22:01.782 - 01:22:03.784] Guest: What emotion are you doing the show with?
[01:22:03.804 - 01:22:05.125] Guest: Why did you close it?
[01:22:05.145 - 01:22:07.207] Guest: Often people meet me and ask me why did you close the show?
[01:22:08.068 - 01:22:11.712] Guest: Actually, we started the Water Foundation.
[01:22:12.913 - 01:22:13.894] Guest: We didn't close the show.
[01:22:13.914 - 01:22:15.256] Guest: We started the Water Foundation.
[01:22:15.276 - 01:22:20.761] Guest: Because we felt that it is a very important job.
[01:22:20.781 - 01:22:23.985] Guest: And it has a huge impact on the land.
[01:22:24.005 - 01:22:25.426] Guest: So we felt that we have to connect with water.
[01:22:26.402 - 01:22:29.305] Guest: And we have to do it in Maharashtra because we are all Maharashtrians.
[01:22:29.325 - 01:22:31.347] Guest: I mean Satya and I are Maharashtrians.
[01:22:31.967 - 01:22:36.592] Guest: So we thought we have to work in our state in the beginning.
[01:22:36.612 - 01:22:39.374] Guest: And we have to work only with water.
[01:22:39.394 - 01:22:42.397] Guest: So the last 16 years, maybe 9 years have passed.
[01:22:43.298 - 01:22:44.159] Guest: It's 2025 right?
[01:22:44.179 - 01:22:45.020] Guest: What year is it?
[01:22:45.040 - 01:22:47.902] Guest: So it's been 8-9 years.
[01:22:47.922 - 01:22:49.864] Guest: We are working in water.
[01:22:49.884 - 01:22:52.146] Guest: And our entire team was of Satya and Jayati.
[01:22:53.428 - 01:22:55.269] Guest: That whole team shifted to water.
[01:22:55.690 - 01:22:56.050] Guest: Wow!
[01:22:56.130 - 01:22:58.593] Guest: So we are working in the same team in the Water Foundation.
[01:22:58.633 - 01:23:02.879] Guest: Because we are only working in Maharashtra for Seemath and Maharashtra.
[01:23:03.220 - 01:23:05.783] Guest: So the rest of the country doesn't know what we are doing.
[01:23:05.803 - 01:23:08.367] Guest: So in fact, the whole team has been shifted to the Water Foundation.
[01:23:09.108 - 01:23:14.275] Guest: And we feel that this is very important work, maybe more than that.
[01:23:14.295 - 01:23:19.442] Guest: We are trying to bring a change on the ground.
[01:23:19.714 - 01:23:23.439] Guest: So that team won't be able to do two things in one team.
[01:23:23.479 - 01:23:23.719] Guest: Yes.
[01:23:23.739 - 01:23:25.021] Guest: Or we can do that or that.
[01:23:25.181 - 01:23:28.045] Guest: And I think this is a very important thing.
[01:23:28.065 - 01:23:30.428] Host: You said that you learned this in every person.
[01:23:31.069 - 01:23:33.212] Host: It's good, bad, positive, negative.
[01:23:35.035 - 01:23:41.884] Host: Tell me one positive or a negative that you want to learn from your child or not.
[01:23:44.267 - 01:23:46.190] Host: What would you don't want your kids to know?
[01:23:46.370 - 01:23:49.554] Host: Like a trait that you want to learn from your child.
[01:23:52.706 - 01:23:54.549] Guest: Hmm.
[01:23:54.569 - 01:23:57.354] Guest: I can't see it from above.
[01:23:58.516 - 01:24:03.223] Guest: I think my children should learn a lot from me.
[01:24:03.243 - 01:24:04.486] Guest: I don't have a negative trait.
[01:24:04.506 - 01:24:06.028] Guest: No.
[01:24:06.068 - 01:24:08.112] Guest: I don't think I have a negative trait.
[01:24:08.172 - 01:24:11.337] Guest: You want them to be obsessed as well?
[01:24:11.357 - 01:24:14.682] Guest: Look, a man wins with passion.
[01:24:14.702 - 01:24:18.208] Guest: A man wins with passion.
[01:24:18.228 - 01:24:19.250] Guest: And every man's passion is different.
[01:24:20.354 - 01:24:22.376] Guest: But every person is a criminal.
[01:24:22.416 - 01:24:26.240] Guest: You will say, no, this person is very normal, he is not a criminal.
[01:24:26.260 - 01:24:27.060] Guest: It is wrong.
[01:24:27.080 - 01:24:30.884] Guest: He is not a criminal from the inside.
[01:24:32.245 - 01:24:37.951] Guest: How much he leaves his criminal on you.
[01:24:37.971 - 01:24:39.192] Guest: I don't think it is special.
[01:24:39.212 - 01:24:42.095] Host: You want them to be close to you, to make a guardrail.
[01:24:42.195 - 01:24:50.002] Guest: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:24:50.114 - 01:24:52.597] Guest: It shouldn't be so hard in terms of emotions.
[01:24:52.697 - 01:24:59.046] Guest: I produced a documentary called Rooberu Roshni.
[01:24:59.226 - 01:25:00.969] Guest: I don't know if you have seen it or not.
[01:25:00.989 - 01:25:01.710] Guest: You will definitely see it.
[01:25:01.730 - 01:25:02.791] Guest: I will send you the link.
[01:25:03.792 - 01:25:05.174] Guest: It was a documentary on forgiveness.
[01:25:07.558 - 01:25:10.642] Guest: So I would like my children to be forgiving.
[01:25:11.823 - 01:25:12.284] Host: Unlike you.
[01:25:12.524 - 01:25:13.065] Guest: Unlike me.
[01:25:13.726 - 01:25:14.547] Guest: Now I am forgiving.
[01:25:14.567 - 01:25:15.288] Host: Now, yeah.
[01:25:15.348 - 01:25:16.850] Guest: I took a lot of time to reach here.
[01:25:17.890 - 01:25:21.676] Guest: But forgiving is a very big thing.
[01:25:21.696 - 01:25:35.717] Guest: When you forgive someone with your heart, who has hurt you, hurt you, or hurt you, but you forgive someone with your heart, you free yourself, and you free that person too.
[01:25:35.737 - 01:25:42.007] Guest: Because I don't have anything in my heart for you, you are happy.
[01:25:42.027 - 01:25:46.514] Guest: So, in the real sense, the ability to forgive
[01:25:46.850 - 01:25:49.734] Guest: is one of the strongest qualities I feel a person can have.
[01:25:49.895 - 01:25:53.280] Host: And one mindset that you want them to have it from you.
[01:25:54.101 - 01:26:04.797] Host: Out of all the qualities that you have, one you want to be honest with myself.
[01:26:08.482 - 01:26:10.124] Guest: I would like my children to have that quality.
[01:26:10.665 - 01:26:16.594] Guest: Be real.
[01:26:18.402 - 01:26:19.383] Guest: They live in their own thoughts.
[01:26:19.403 - 01:26:20.764] Guest: They give themselves a delusion.
[01:26:20.784 - 01:26:21.625] Guest: They give themselves a delusion.
[01:26:22.065 - 01:26:25.028] Guest: They delude themselves that this is right, that is right, this is going on, this is right.
[01:26:26.009 - 01:26:27.370] Guest: Be real about yourself.
[01:26:28.572 - 01:26:29.572] Guest: And be caring to others.
[01:26:31.314 - 01:26:32.535] Guest: Be caring to others.
[01:26:34.057 - 01:26:35.438] Guest: And my children are also very caring.
[01:26:36.339 - 01:26:37.480] Guest: Aira is also very caring.
[01:26:37.500 - 01:26:38.481] Guest: Junaid is also very caring.
[01:26:38.501 - 01:26:40.302] Guest: And Azad too.
[01:26:40.363 - 01:26:42.404] Guest: All three are very caring children.
[01:26:42.424 - 01:26:43.686] Guest: Always take care of others.
[01:26:45.027 - 01:26:48.370] Guest: And yeah, I think they are good kids.
[01:26:48.834 - 01:27:02.615] Host: You know, one thing I want to appreciate, you are the first person in my life, who is very successful on a very big pedestal.
[01:27:03.497 - 01:27:09.426] Host: And mostly, all the Bollywood stars come, they get late.
[01:27:10.050 - 01:27:16.058] Host: mostly delayed, delayed, late, I think.
[01:27:16.178 - 01:27:19.243] Host: I don't know, it's a thing, it's a joke in the office also.
[01:27:19.323 - 01:27:23.949] Guest: We always get late, actor is always late, actor is late, even I am late today.
[01:27:23.969 - 01:27:24.089] Host: Right?
[01:27:24.910 - 01:27:28.556] Host: And he always says, we are on time, okay?
[01:27:28.876 - 01:27:31.039] Host: We are late, whatever.
[01:27:32.020 - 01:27:37.488] Host: You instantly called and didn't give a bullshit story.
[01:27:38.289 - 01:27:39.090] Host: You told me,
[01:27:39.234 - 01:27:47.125] Host: I loved honesty, I have never been so honest that I got up late.
[01:27:47.205 - 01:27:51.651] Host: I have never appreciated internally something more than this.
[01:27:51.792 - 01:27:52.793] Host: I don't know why.
[01:27:53.134 - 01:27:54.696] Host: Maybe it was a normal thing.
[01:27:54.716 - 01:28:01.946] Host: A lot of people can be like this, I have to tell the stars that it's okay, it's late, it's late.
[01:28:01.966 - 01:28:03.769] Guest: What difference does it make?
[01:28:03.809 - 01:28:04.850] Host: A can be like, no, I'll tell you.
[01:28:05.154 - 01:28:09.139] Host: And I will make an excuse that I was working.
[01:28:09.319 - 01:28:13.764] Host: Mostly people said that there was traffic, there was an emergency, there was some work at home, whatever.
[01:28:14.645 - 01:28:19.411] Host: You were so honest that yes brother, I woke up late.
[01:28:19.431 - 01:28:21.273] Host: That is pinnacle for me.
[01:28:21.293 - 01:28:21.814] Host: I loved it.
[01:28:22.014 - 01:28:26.539] Guest: No, when I woke up late, I was getting ready a little early.
[01:28:26.559 - 01:28:28.722] Guest: I realized that I could not reach by 12 o'clock.
[01:28:29.314 - 01:28:32.799] Guest: I think I called you and I said, I'm getting late, I'm really sorry.
[01:28:33.299 - 01:28:37.705] Host: And you, the excuse that you had was honesty to me, that is appreciation.
[01:28:37.725 - 01:28:40.448] Host: Not that you're getting late or you're telling me.
[01:28:40.468 - 01:28:41.490] Host: Yes, yes, yes.
[01:28:41.510 - 01:28:41.910] Host: It's the fact.
[01:28:41.930 - 01:28:42.872] Guest: Yes, I didn't have any special excuse.
[01:28:42.892 - 01:28:43.873] Guest: The fact, I said.
[01:28:43.893 - 01:28:44.353] Guest: Exactly.
[01:28:45.114 - 01:28:46.536] Guest: I have a story here.
[01:28:49.480 - 01:28:51.503] Guest: I have a very deep sleep.
[01:28:52.284 - 01:28:53.025] Guest: It's always there.
[01:28:53.205 - 01:28:53.926] Guest: That is so good.
[01:28:54.326 - 01:28:57.170] Guest: And once I go to sleep, it's very difficult to wake me up.
[01:28:57.666 - 01:29:03.414] Guest: Even today, my boy, Santosh, is the biggest thing that I wake up in the morning.
[01:29:03.454 - 01:29:07.499] Guest: Because if he doesn't wake me up on time, then I wake up late.
[01:29:07.519 - 01:29:08.901] Guest: Now, I don't wake up.
[01:29:09.141 - 01:29:10.263] Guest: So, he also suffers.
[01:29:10.283 - 01:29:12.646] Guest: He gets tired of thinking.
[01:29:13.187 - 01:29:14.428] Guest: So, it's not from now.
[01:29:14.448 - 01:29:16.871] Guest: It's been about 15-20 years.
[01:29:16.891 - 01:29:19.395] Guest: The table next to my bed.
[01:29:19.415 - 01:29:22.759] Guest: The spray we use in the makeup is water spray.
[01:29:23.420 - 01:29:24.882] Guest: It sprays on my face.
[01:29:24.962 - 01:29:27.205] Guest: When I am not getting up, it takes 5-10 minutes to get up.
[01:29:27.225 - 01:29:28.827] Guest: You don't even get up with the alarm?
[01:29:28.887 - 01:29:29.407] Guest: No.
[01:29:29.647 - 01:29:32.371] Guest: So what I was doing was the film Parampara.
[01:29:32.391 - 01:29:34.834] Guest: And the shooting of Parampara was about to start.
[01:29:34.854 - 01:29:36.996] Guest: And I was working with Yajji for the first time.
[01:29:37.016 - 01:29:40.460] Guest: Yajji is the director of the top.
[01:29:40.480 - 01:29:42.102] Guest: I am talking about 1993-94.
[01:29:42.122 - 01:29:44.725] Guest: Because I think there was a film in 1995 before that.
[01:29:46.627 - 01:29:48.289] Guest: So Yajji said, I want to do a photo session.
[01:29:48.309 - 01:29:50.432] Guest: You come tomorrow at 11.
[01:29:50.452 - 01:29:52.274] Guest: We will do a photo session.
[01:29:52.770 - 01:29:55.473] Guest: the character will come tomorrow, he will shoot Rakesh Srishta.
[01:29:56.294 - 01:30:00.420] Guest: So I said, yes, I won't be able to come tomorrow at 11 o'clock because I have a shooting of Jojita and Sikandar.
[01:30:02.002 - 01:30:06.207] Guest: So, you... Oh, so it's before that.
[01:30:06.628 - 01:30:08.490] Guest: Anyway, when being... Time.
[01:30:08.510 - 01:30:09.952] Guest: Time not relevant.
[01:30:09.972 - 01:30:12.034] Guest: You can think of early 90s.
[01:30:12.055 - 01:30:18.162] Guest: So, I said I won't be able to come at 11 o'clock because I have a shooting that starts at 9 o'clock.
[01:30:18.182 - 01:30:21.106] Guest: I can request the director that I come late for one and a half hour.
[01:30:22.530 - 01:30:26.316] Guest: But I won't be able to do it later than that.
[01:30:26.336 - 01:30:27.197] Guest: So let's do one thing.
[01:30:27.417 - 01:30:28.078] Guest: We need 3-4 hours.
[01:30:28.098 - 01:30:30.622] Guest: So we'll start at 7 o'clock.
[01:30:30.642 - 01:30:32.064] Guest: So from 7-9, 7-10, we'll do it.
[01:30:32.365 - 01:30:34.908] Guest: Then I'll reach shooting by 11 o'clock.
[01:30:34.928 - 01:30:37.813] Guest: I requested Mansoor that I'm coming 2 hours late.
[01:30:37.833 - 01:30:41.718] Guest: He also said, okay, I'll do something else for 2 hours.
[01:30:41.738 - 01:30:47.507] Guest: So it was decided that I'll reach film city by 7 o'clock in the morning.
[01:30:47.527 - 01:30:50.612] Guest: Now I woke up at 11.30 in the morning.
[01:30:50.632 - 01:30:52.274] Guest: I woke up at 11.30.
[01:30:53.090 - 01:30:59.059] Guest: And when I woke up, I saw the time, it was 11.30.
[01:31:00.682 - 01:31:04.328] Guest: So I got so upset that I scolded Reena.
[01:31:04.348 - 01:31:06.371] Guest: The boy I had at that time scolded him.
[01:31:06.391 - 01:31:08.875] Guest: I said, what are you doing?
[01:31:09.015 - 01:31:12.340] Guest: It's the first day with Yashji.
[01:31:12.360 - 01:31:14.584] Guest: And I have shifted at 7 o'clock.
[01:31:14.604 - 01:31:17.208] Guest: And Yashji said, I will come early in the morning.
[01:31:17.228 - 01:31:20.633] Guest: I said, I will come in the morning.
[01:31:20.653 - 01:31:21.234] Guest: He was a little stammer.
[01:31:21.954 - 01:31:26.359] Guest: So, I said, how bad does it feel that I didn't work in life?
[01:31:26.379 - 01:31:28.302] Guest: For the first time, I was late.
[01:31:28.322 - 01:31:29.183] Guest: And it was 11 o'clock.
[01:31:29.203 - 01:31:31.285] Guest: Not even that I didn't reach at 7 o'clock.
[01:31:31.305 - 01:31:31.846] Guest: Like I called.
[01:31:31.866 - 01:31:32.687] Guest: There was no phone.
[01:31:32.707 - 01:31:33.488] Guest: There were 11 and a half kids.
[01:31:33.508 - 01:31:34.749] Guest: Nothing was happening.
[01:31:34.769 - 01:31:37.853] Guest: I just woke up empty-handed.
[01:31:37.913 - 01:31:40.236] Guest: I was so angry that I said, you guys are amazing.
[01:31:40.837 - 01:31:44.681] Guest: I didn't wake up on such a day.
[01:31:44.701 - 01:31:45.662] Guest: So, Reena said, shut up.
[01:31:45.983 - 01:31:46.503] Guest: We woke you up.
[01:31:47.424 - 01:31:48.786] Guest: So, you said, shooting is cancelled.
[01:31:50.626 - 01:31:53.830] Guest: and you fell asleep again.
[01:31:53.850 - 01:31:55.351] Guest: So I said, when did I say shooting cancel?
[01:31:55.371 - 01:31:58.956] Guest: You said Mansoor's shooting cancel and HG's photo session also cancel.
[01:31:59.616 - 01:32:03.801] Guest: So when you said cancel, we agreed to let him sleep when the work is cancelled.
[01:32:05.623 - 01:32:07.225] Guest: That day I realized that I lie in sleep.
[01:32:07.245 - 01:32:12.871] Guest: The desire of sleeping is so much that at that time, no, no, he got cancelled.
[01:32:12.911 - 01:32:15.154] Guest: He got cancelled and I fell asleep again.
[01:32:16.546 - 01:32:18.408] Guest: Now, probably it was...
[01:32:18.568 - 01:32:19.590] Guest: I don't remember.
[01:32:19.670 - 01:32:21.212] Guest: I said, when did I tell you?
[01:32:21.232 - 01:32:22.313] Guest: What are you saying?
[01:32:22.333 - 01:32:24.416] Guest: He said, no, you said that you have been cancelled.
[01:32:25.597 - 01:32:27.639] Guest: So I said, then I had to believe it.
[01:32:27.660 - 01:32:27.980] Guest: It's weird.
[01:32:28.000 - 01:32:29.041] Guest: I lied in my sleep.
[01:32:29.101 - 01:32:34.488] Guest: Now, probably it was that I had to call yesji right now.
[01:32:34.508 - 01:32:37.371] Guest: So I called yesji.
[01:32:37.391 - 01:32:41.216] Guest: Then he said, you didn't come.
[01:32:41.236 - 01:32:42.858] Guest: So yesji, I am very sorry.
[01:32:42.958 - 01:32:44.880] Guest: And you will also think what am I saying.
[01:32:45.641 - 01:32:46.162] Guest: But...
[01:32:46.370 - 01:32:47.952] Guest: I am so ashamed.
[01:32:48.432 - 01:32:49.233] Guest: I couldn't get up.
[01:32:49.353 - 01:32:50.515] Guest: I should get up 10 minutes ago.
[01:32:52.797 - 01:32:54.679] Guest: So, Yashji's silence came on the phone.
[01:32:54.699 - 01:32:58.784] Guest: He was thinking that he was misbehaving with me.
[01:32:58.804 - 01:33:00.486] Guest: He was saying that he was feeling unwell.
[01:33:00.506 - 01:33:01.387] Guest: What is he saying?
[01:33:01.407 - 01:33:04.590] Guest: I didn't get up.
[01:33:04.610 - 01:33:08.334] Guest: And then I explained to him that actually, Yashji is my life problem.
[01:33:08.354 - 01:33:10.296] Guest: I didn't get up.
[01:33:10.316 - 01:33:11.257] Guest: Okay, Yashji is listening.
[01:33:11.277 - 01:33:12.439] Guest: I am working with him for the first time.
[01:33:12.459 - 01:33:15.442] Guest: This man is telling me that I couldn't get up in the morning.
[01:33:16.226 - 01:33:17.507] Guest: If I remove it from the film, then it will be better.
[01:33:17.687 - 01:33:20.030] Guest: So all this means that I had become so awkward.
[01:33:20.070 - 01:33:22.232] Guest: So I said to Yajji, I'm so sorry, Yajji.
[01:33:22.252 - 01:33:26.255] Guest: I am very sorry, but the truth is that I didn't get up.
[01:33:26.275 - 01:33:26.796] Guest: I didn't get up.
[01:33:26.816 - 01:33:35.184] Host: I had a question because you said that you are very involved with the successes, losses, you want to know what's going on, right?
[01:33:36.205 - 01:33:46.034] Host: Your movie does good or bad, it only affects that Junaid's movie does good or bad.
[01:33:46.946 - 01:33:50.770] Guest: This is a very fresh question because this is my fresh emotion.
[01:33:50.790 - 01:34:09.811] Guest: I always thought that I am so crazy with my work that what is happening with that work is success, whether people like it or not, that is very important for me.
[01:34:09.831 - 01:34:13.195] Guest: There is nothing more important than that.
[01:34:13.215 - 01:34:15.858] Guest: But when Junaid stepped into the industry, I realized that actually,
[01:34:16.770 - 01:34:20.314] Guest: the emotions of a father overtakes them.
[01:34:22.217 - 01:34:31.728] Guest: So, any day, in today's date, I am more attached to Junaid's work, I am more attached to him, that he should be successful.
[01:34:33.591 - 01:34:40.699] Guest: His success and his emotion, forget success, it's the emotion, I want him to be happy with the work he's done, I want him to get the due of what he's doing.
[01:34:41.520 - 01:34:44.104] Guest: As a father, that's a very strong emotion.
[01:34:45.005 - 01:34:46.066] Guest: So, I have to say that
[01:34:47.810 - 01:34:58.226] Guest: whether it is Junaid or Aira, or tomorrow when Azad will work, I think I will be more concerned about their success and failure of their life than mine.
[01:34:59.548 - 01:35:12.569] Guest: My children's life and future, my children's future and their life is more important for me than my family.
[01:35:12.589 - 01:35:13.330] Guest: I realized this.
[01:35:13.570 - 01:35:17.015] Guest: Your flop will go, but his flop won't go.
[01:35:17.035 - 01:35:18.818] Guest: Yes, his flop won't go.
[01:35:18.838 - 01:35:20.781] Guest: Like Lavia came and didn't go.
[01:35:20.821 - 01:35:21.662] Guest: I liked the film.
[01:35:21.682 - 01:35:23.445] Guest: I thought that Junaid did a good job.
[01:35:24.667 - 01:35:29.815] Guest: And the role that Junaid did is not his type at all.
[01:35:29.995 - 01:35:31.938] Guest: It is not like that in real life.
[01:35:33.701 - 01:35:40.311] Guest: So, Junaid has a very amazing quality that he becomes a character.
[01:35:40.331 - 01:35:42.514] Guest: The character you see in the film, you think that is him.
[01:35:43.362 - 01:35:45.765] Guest: The first time I experienced this was in Lal Singh Chadda.
[01:35:46.406 - 01:35:52.494] Guest: When Lal Singh Chadda was being formed, in the beginning, I started growing my beard.
[01:35:52.514 - 01:35:53.556] Guest: It was six months.
[01:35:53.576 - 01:35:58.582] Guest: And Junaid came to learn fresh theatre.
[01:35:58.602 - 01:36:04.911] Guest: In American Academy of Dramatic Arts, he did two years of course and then one year for him.
[01:36:06.533 - 01:36:10.258] Guest: So when he came back, I thought, let's see what he has learned.
[01:36:11.010 - 01:36:17.277] Guest: So I told Adwiyath that do one thing, take out the 8-10 scenes of Lalsing Chadda.
[01:36:17.297 - 01:36:18.378] Guest: And you shoot with Junaid.
[01:36:18.398 - 01:36:21.081] Guest: For example, Junaid Lala, I am not there.
[01:36:21.121 - 01:36:23.984] Guest: First, I will see how Junaid works.
[01:36:24.004 - 01:36:25.827] Guest: Second, are you ready to direct this film or not?
[01:36:25.867 - 01:36:27.709] Guest: He will also come to understand me.
[01:36:27.729 - 01:36:28.850] Guest: Two things will be tested.
[01:36:28.890 - 01:36:32.894] Guest: You will also be tested and Junaid will also be tested.
[01:36:32.914 - 01:36:37.039] Guest: So he took time for two weeks, not much.
[01:36:37.520 - 01:36:39.762] Guest: In two weeks, he shot me a 20-minute 8-10 scene.
[01:36:40.482 - 01:36:41.103] Guest: with Junayat.
[01:36:41.123 - 01:36:44.087] Guest: He looked at me and I moved.
[01:36:45.530 - 01:36:47.352] Guest: I thought, what has Junayat done?
[01:36:47.372 - 01:36:51.679] Guest: And this is the first time he has come back from the theatre school.
[01:36:51.719 - 01:36:53.261] Guest: He is doing something for the first time.
[01:36:53.281 - 01:36:53.962] Guest: So I was confused.
[01:36:53.982 - 01:36:57.668] Guest: I thought, is this father's love or actually he has done such a good job.
[01:36:57.728 - 01:36:58.469] Guest: I don't understand.
[01:36:58.489 - 01:37:01.634] Host: Why do you think Loveyapa didn't work for him?
[01:37:01.654 - 01:37:03.176] Guest: I think he...
[01:37:04.979 - 01:37:08.625] Guest: He got a very negative backlash towards that film.
[01:37:08.645 - 01:37:09.586] Guest: I want to believe that.
[01:37:09.730 - 01:37:12.353] Guest: Because there was a lot of troll in the film.
[01:37:12.373 - 01:37:14.735] Guest: There was a lot of nepotism.
[01:37:14.755 - 01:37:16.076] Guest: Nepotism, these are Nepo kids.
[01:37:16.096 - 01:37:21.061] Guest: Whereas, Junaid and I are not like that.
[01:37:21.081 - 01:37:25.345] Guest: I mean, Junaid is like that.
[01:37:25.365 - 01:37:27.948] Guest: You know that my sister Nikhat, she acts.
[01:37:27.968 - 01:37:30.710] Guest: She has been acting for the last 4-5 years.
[01:37:30.731 - 01:37:34.134] Guest: When we went to Kapil Sharma's show, people saw her for the first time.
[01:37:34.154 - 01:37:37.777] Guest: Okay, this is my sister, she is acting now.
[01:37:37.797 - 01:37:38.418] Guest: Did you see Patan?
[01:37:39.074 - 01:37:51.333] Guest: The Afghani woman in Pathan, which I did not see in the film, but I have heard that she calls Shahrukh Tawiz and gives the title that from today you will call him Pathan.
[01:37:51.353 - 01:37:52.034] Guest: That's my sister.
[01:37:54.978 - 01:37:58.143] Guest: So no one in the industry knew that she is my sister.
[01:37:58.163 - 01:38:05.074] Guest: When Nikhat decided to act at the age of 50 or something, she told me that I was thinking that I am interested.
[01:38:05.186 - 01:38:08.810] Guest: Actually, it was always like this, but then I didn't do it.
[01:38:08.830 - 01:38:10.652] Guest: Now I think I can do it.
[01:38:10.752 - 01:38:10.932] Guest: Okay.
[01:38:10.952 - 01:38:11.693] Guest: So it's a good thing.
[01:38:11.713 - 01:38:12.894] Guest: I didn't know how she was acting.
[01:38:14.076 - 01:38:16.078] Guest: So she said, what should I do?
[01:38:16.098 - 01:38:21.284] Guest: I said, you go to the casting director's office and give a screen test.
[01:38:22.985 - 01:38:24.627] Guest: If they like it, they will give you a role.
[01:38:26.589 - 01:38:31.655] Guest: So she used to go to all the casting directors and ask for roles and do the screen test.
[01:38:32.816 - 01:38:34.578] Guest: She never said that I am Aamir's sister.
[01:38:35.202 - 01:38:37.004] Guest: Not at all.
[01:38:37.204 - 01:38:39.066] Guest: And I used to tell someone that she is my sister.
[01:38:40.568 - 01:38:44.393] Guest: So whatever work she has got so far, she has got it on her own.
[01:38:44.413 - 01:38:51.601] Guest: The show of Kapil, a few months ago, when people got to know that she is my sister.
[01:38:51.821 - 01:38:53.623] Guest: Until then, no one knew that she is my sister.
[01:38:54.785 - 01:39:02.834] Guest: So nepotism or giving a role to someone close to you, these are not from me.
[01:39:04.482 - 01:39:05.163] Host: But why not?
[01:39:05.303 - 01:39:07.968] Host: No, you can't do it with the film.
[01:39:08.008 - 01:39:12.295] Host: But at least connect with the right people and send them to the right place.
[01:39:12.315 - 01:39:15.300] Guest: No, they will find their place.
[01:39:15.320 - 01:39:17.544] Guest: The right way is to go to the casting director.
[01:39:17.564 - 01:39:26.199] Guest: A normal person who is not Aamir Khan's brother or sister or son, he goes to the casting director and says, this is my name, you give me work.
[01:39:26.439 - 01:39:27.361] Guest: He says, this is the scene.
[01:39:28.282 - 01:39:29.525] Guest: This is the casting of this film.
[01:39:29.565 - 01:39:30.045] Guest: This is the scene.
[01:39:30.065 - 01:39:30.386] Guest: Read it.
[01:39:31.650 - 01:39:32.491] Guest: It will be good.
[01:39:32.531 - 01:39:33.472] Guest: You will get a scene.
[01:39:33.492 - 01:39:34.473] Guest: No, you won't get a scene.
[01:39:34.493 - 01:39:36.696] Host: But there will be some advantage to it.
[01:39:36.716 - 01:39:38.098] Host: To at least go to the right offices.
[01:39:38.438 - 01:39:38.779] Host: I am sure.
[01:39:41.702 - 01:39:44.405] Guest: Up till now, I have not interfered in Junaid's career.
[01:39:45.266 - 01:39:46.228] Guest: And nor do I want to.
[01:39:47.029 - 01:39:47.890] Host: Will you at any point?
[01:39:47.970 - 01:39:48.210] Guest: Never.
[01:39:50.052 - 01:39:54.297] Host: Do you tell him that he shouldn't do this kind of script?
[01:39:54.317 - 01:39:54.518] Guest: No.
[01:39:54.578 - 01:39:57.701] Guest: Look, let me tell you.
[01:39:57.781 - 01:40:01.586] Guest: I tried to help Faisal when he took the first step in acting.
[01:40:01.762 - 01:40:03.645] Guest: Unfortunately, the first film didn't go well.
[01:40:03.665 - 01:40:08.733] Guest: So I was very worried and I tried very hard to support his career.
[01:40:08.773 - 01:40:11.798] Guest: I also did a film with him, whose name was Mela.
[01:40:14.102 - 01:40:18.148] Guest: But I had put my whole effort to help him.
[01:40:18.208 - 01:40:25.921] Guest: But I realized that this is a field in which no one can help anyone.
[01:40:25.941 - 01:40:29.106] Guest: I can only reach God and give him my success.
[01:40:30.562 - 01:40:31.844] Guest: I can't do anything in front of it.
[01:40:33.626 - 01:40:34.788] Guest: You actually cannot do anything.
[01:40:35.709 - 01:40:37.491] Guest: So I personally tried and failed.
[01:40:37.552 - 01:40:47.365] Guest: And I understood that this is a line that you take your fate, you take your hard work and you make your own path.
[01:40:47.505 - 01:40:52.892] Guest: And that is the right way to learn and move forward.
[01:40:52.912 - 01:40:58.841] Guest: So, in fact, I had a little discourage to Junaid when he told me for the first time that I have to act.
[01:40:58.981 - 01:40:59.922] Guest: And I have to learn acting.
[01:41:00.034 - 01:41:03.139] Guest: I want to go to school.
[01:41:04.661 - 01:41:04.821] Guest: Why?
[01:41:04.841 - 01:41:11.211] Guest: I told him that until today he was a very shy kid.
[01:41:11.231 - 01:41:13.173] Guest: I was also very shy.
[01:41:15.357 - 01:41:22.007] Guest: So I said, you haven't seen anything like this yet that I think you have acting qualities.
[01:41:23.208 - 01:41:25.251] Guest: I don't even know what you are doing.
[01:41:27.094 - 01:41:29.778] Guest: He said, yes, I understand but I want to learn.
[01:41:29.858 - 01:41:35.004] Guest: So I said, okay, whatever you want to learn, we will support you.
[01:41:35.024 - 01:41:37.386] Guest: Your parents will fully support you.
[01:41:37.747 - 01:41:43.473] Guest: Whatever craft you want to learn, whatever profession you want to go to, we will educate you.
[01:41:43.493 - 01:41:48.138] Guest: But after that, you have to make your own place.
[01:41:48.158 - 01:41:51.622] Guest: I called him in the first meeting.
[01:41:52.943 - 01:41:59.250] Guest: And I told him that when you will come back after 3 years, 2 years of acting, and when I will see your work,
[01:42:00.482 - 01:42:09.255] Guest: If I think, no, you don't have the courage, then I will tell you immediately to be ready to listen.
[01:42:09.275 - 01:42:14.323] Guest: If I think your work is not good, then I will frankly say, no, you are not doing well.
[01:42:14.343 - 01:42:17.488] Guest: I will not be able to lie.
[01:42:17.508 - 01:42:19.831] Guest: And I will not give you work.
[01:42:19.851 - 01:42:22.215] Guest: If your work is not good, then I will not give you work.
[01:42:22.235 - 01:42:25.139] Guest: There is no chance in life that I will give you work.
[01:42:25.159 - 01:42:28.705] Guest: I will not be able to do wrong with my work.
[01:42:28.725 - 01:42:29.586] Guest: I will not be able to do it.
[01:42:31.394 - 01:42:32.616] Guest: So he said, yeah, Papa, I know that.
[01:42:33.497 - 01:42:36.241] Guest: I don't understand anything else about him.
[01:42:36.761 - 01:42:38.043] Guest: That you're not going to help me.
[01:42:38.083 - 01:42:39.765] Guest: I said, are you clear?
[01:42:39.786 - 01:42:40.507] Guest: He said, yes, I'm clear.
[01:42:40.527 - 01:42:42.589] Guest: I said, okay, whatever you want to learn.
[01:42:42.609 - 01:42:44.812] Guest: I said, there's going to be a disadvantage, especially for you.
[01:42:45.353 - 01:42:46.314] Guest: You'll be compared with me.
[01:42:47.676 - 01:42:51.462] Guest: The one who is not normal with anyone, it will be with you.
[01:42:51.842 - 01:42:53.524] Guest: That you'll be compared with Amir Khan.
[01:42:53.544 - 01:42:55.828] Guest: He will do it.
[01:42:55.848 - 01:42:57.650] Guest: So this is a big disadvantage for you.
[01:42:59.074 - 01:43:01.858] Guest: Because people will think in their mind that he is Amir's son, they don't know what to do.
[01:43:01.878 - 01:43:05.263] Guest: Now you have to match him with his imagination.
[01:43:07.626 - 01:43:09.248] Guest: So that's a disadvantage.
[01:43:09.268 - 01:43:10.169] Guest: So he said, I'll deal with that.
[01:43:12.052 - 01:43:13.173] Guest: So he's a very strong kid.
[01:43:13.995 - 01:43:14.896] Guest: And I've seen him grow.
[01:43:15.036 - 01:43:15.477] Guest: I think he's...
[01:43:16.919 - 01:43:18.441] Guest: I think he's a very good actor.
[01:43:19.923 - 01:43:22.827] Guest: He has the potential of a very good actor.
[01:43:22.967 - 01:43:23.408] Host: I think so.
[01:43:23.428 - 01:43:24.329] Host: He said he gets confused in character.
[01:43:25.971 - 01:43:28.114] Host: One thing I wanted to know from you.
[01:43:28.482 - 01:43:29.203] Host: about character.
[01:43:29.283 - 01:43:29.763] Host: You do it.
[01:43:29.783 - 01:43:34.608] Host: You do a lot of transformation on the body to become a character.
[01:43:36.470 - 01:43:39.393] Host: Many, like few people do it, so much transformation.
[01:43:39.814 - 01:43:46.520] Host: So when you do so much body transformation, you become so fat, then thin, 9% body fat, all this happened.
[01:43:47.141 - 01:43:54.048] Host: So what was the point which was the scariest, the scar on your body, because it's unhealthy to do it again and again, right?
[01:43:54.909 - 01:43:55.890] Host: Which was the
[01:43:56.066 - 01:43:59.249] Host: toughest health scar on your body during transformation.
[01:43:59.269 - 01:44:00.390] Host: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:00.410 - 01:44:01.271] Host: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:01.291 - 01:44:03.553] Host: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:03.573 - 01:44:04.774] Host: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:04.794 - 01:44:05.715] Host: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:05.735 - 01:44:06.736] Host: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:06.756 - 01:44:08.198] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:08.218 - 01:44:09.099] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:09.119 - 01:44:10.059] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:10.079 - 01:44:12.342] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:12.362 - 01:44:13.263] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:13.283 - 01:44:15.345] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:15.365 - 01:44:16.305] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:16.325 - 01:44:18.047] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:18.067 - 01:44:18.988] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:19.008 - 01:44:19.849] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:19.869 - 01:44:20.970] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:20.990 - 01:44:21.831] Unknown: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:21.851 - 01:44:22.712] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:22.732 - 01:44:23.953] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:23.973 - 01:44:24.814] Guest: What do you think is the toughest in this?
[01:44:24.834 - 01:44:25.234] Guest: What do you think is
[01:44:25.506 - 01:44:29.671] Guest: character's shooting was still there.
[01:44:29.691 - 01:44:33.316] Guest: So I had those five months to reduce my weight, to bring change in my body.
[01:44:33.836 - 01:44:38.763] Guest: In those five months, I had to be very strict.
[01:44:41.085 - 01:44:42.988] Guest: I had to be very strict, which is difficult.
[01:44:43.749 - 01:44:47.013] Guest: It is difficult, it is challenging, it is fun in the challenge.
[01:44:47.053 - 01:44:54.322] Guest: And my family scolded me a lot that you are playing a lot with your body, Kiran is very
[01:44:54.466 - 01:45:01.838] Guest: upset, mother was very upset that what is happening, your health will be affected, you are not realizing it now, you will find out later.
[01:45:03.020 - 01:45:09.331] Guest: But at that time, you don't even listen, you are in intoxication, you are in pain.
[01:45:09.351 - 01:45:13.398] Guest: So I did it, and till now I did not get any physical reaction.
[01:45:13.999 - 01:45:18.927] Guest: So I think it's okay, touchwood is still there.
[01:45:18.947 - 01:45:20.530] Host: And do you do do do three times a
[01:45:20.706 - 01:45:23.811] Host: You used to work out at some time?
[01:45:23.831 - 01:45:26.114] Guest: When I did Gajni, I used to train a lot.
[01:45:26.134 - 01:45:28.878] Guest: Two times a day or three times a day?
[01:45:28.898 - 01:45:32.384] Guest: No, I used to work out for three and a half hours a day.
[01:45:32.404 - 01:45:32.784] Guest: Once a day?
[01:45:32.804 - 01:45:34.247] Guest: Once a day.
[01:45:34.827 - 01:45:36.790] Guest: The morning time.
[01:45:38.713 - 01:45:40.596] Guest: And that's called overtraining.
[01:45:40.917 - 01:45:43.461] Guest: What do you used to do?
[01:45:43.481 - 01:45:44.402] Guest: You will laugh if I tell you.
[01:45:45.986 - 01:45:51.352] Guest: It was boring to do apps for me and I was irritated to do apps.
[01:45:53.435 - 01:45:58.160] Guest: So I thought, my trainer was Chintu Satya.
[01:45:58.180 - 01:46:02.705] Guest: So I told Chintu, let's do this, let's do it with the warm up apps.
[01:46:02.725 - 01:46:05.849] Guest: So two things will happen, two in one, it will be a warm up too.
[01:46:05.869 - 01:46:07.070] Guest: And the apps are gone.
[01:46:07.210 - 01:46:07.811] Guest: Kill the frog.
[01:46:08.091 - 01:46:09.433] Guest: Kill the frog, finish it quickly.
[01:46:09.573 - 01:46:11.816] Guest: So he said okay, let's start with the apps.
[01:46:11.836 - 01:46:13.938] Guest: So the first day,
[01:46:14.338 - 01:46:24.894] Guest: I mean, I did 20-25 crunches, 20-25 leg raises, hanging leg raises, by mixing like this.
[01:46:24.914 - 01:46:28.219] Guest: But without stopping, 200 reps I did of abs.
[01:46:31.644 - 01:46:33.707] Guest: Now that happens that the body adapts.
[01:46:34.969 - 01:46:36.691] Guest: So 200 abs is very easy for me.
[01:46:38.114 - 01:46:43.762] Guest: Because within a month, where I used to sit-ups,
[01:46:44.738 - 01:46:45.519] Guest: Now I am doing 50.
[01:46:45.539 - 01:46:49.443] Guest: What I used to do without waiting, now I am waiting.
[01:46:49.543 - 01:46:55.088] Guest: So, the warm-up increased.
[01:46:55.108 - 01:47:00.053] Guest: I did 200, then I came in a mood for one day, so I did 300, 400, then I said 500.
[01:47:00.093 - 01:47:04.257] Guest: So, in two months, I reached 1000.
[01:47:05.258 - 01:47:06.219] Guest: 1000 repetitions.
[01:47:07.040 - 01:47:07.640] Guest: Within two months?
[01:47:07.660 - 01:47:07.961] Guest: Yes.
[01:47:09.042 - 01:47:10.683] Guest: 1000 repetitions of abs.
[01:47:11.564 - 01:47:13.426] Guest: Different exercises without stopping.
[01:47:13.602 - 01:47:15.425] Guest: And it used to take me 55 minutes.
[01:47:17.769 - 01:47:20.694] Guest: In 55 minutes, my warm-up was over.
[01:47:20.714 - 01:47:21.656] Guest: Now the apps are over.
[01:47:23.559 - 01:47:26.584] Guest: I thought we were doing something amazing.
[01:47:28.467 - 01:47:35.479] Guest: At that time, I didn't realize that this is called overtraining.
[01:47:35.499 - 01:47:39.346] Guest: And I used to get better results if I didn't overtrain.
[01:47:39.746 - 01:47:41.908] Guest: But I was in that madness.
[01:47:41.928 - 01:47:43.770] Guest: The more you do, the better it will be.
[01:47:43.790 - 01:47:45.552] Guest: The better it will be.
[01:47:45.572 - 01:47:49.015] Guest: The more you do, you know, we feel that when you do more of one thing, you will reach there faster.
[01:47:49.055 - 01:47:49.856] Guest: That's not necessary.
[01:47:51.497 - 01:47:54.740] Guest: So, I used to warm up with abs 55 minutes ago.
[01:47:54.760 - 01:48:04.830] Guest: After that, I used to typically do two body parts in a day.
[01:48:04.850 - 01:48:09.074] Guest: So, I used to run my workout for 1.5 hours.
[01:48:09.922 - 01:48:14.127] Guest: So it was half an hour, 55 minutes plus one and a half.
[01:48:14.167 - 01:48:15.809] Guest: After that, I used to do cardio for an hour.
[01:48:17.211 - 01:48:17.992] Guest: So three and a half hours.
[01:48:19.293 - 01:48:20.775] Guest: So three and a half hours was my workout.
[01:48:22.157 - 01:48:27.283] Guest: And by the end of the workout, I used to be so exhausted that I used to go up, have a shower and fall asleep.
[01:48:28.685 - 01:48:31.188] Guest: And during that time, I was doing editing of Tarizami.
[01:48:31.508 - 01:48:34.331] Guest: The film I directed, its editing was going on.
[01:48:34.351 - 01:48:36.594] Guest: So I was prepping for Gajini's shooting.
[01:48:36.898 - 01:48:37.539] Guest: body wise.
[01:48:38.199 - 01:48:41.323] Guest: But actually my job was editing at that time.
[01:48:41.343 - 01:48:44.206] Guest: So I am very lazy and I didn't like the workout at all.
[01:48:44.226 - 01:48:45.548] Guest: I was doing it for the first time.
[01:48:45.568 - 01:48:52.716] Guest: So I made a rule for myself that until I don't have a workout, I am not allowed to enter the editing room.
[01:48:55.639 - 01:48:56.019] Guest: Nice.
[01:48:56.039 - 01:49:01.906] Guest: So if I am working out at 8 in the morning and Chintu is here, we are sitting and I am not in the mood.
[01:49:02.082 - 01:49:05.788] Guest: And I am making an excuse to have one more coffee.
[01:49:05.868 - 01:49:08.191] Guest: I am not doing it today.
[01:49:08.272 - 01:49:14.802] Guest: If I don't do it today, then I won't be able to do editing today.
[01:49:14.822 - 01:49:15.623] Guest: I have made a rule.
[01:49:15.643 - 01:49:16.905] Guest: And I was very excited to go to editing.
[01:49:16.965 - 01:49:18.768] Guest: I have to go there.
[01:49:18.788 - 01:49:20.170] Guest: I can't stop myself from that.
[01:49:20.190 - 01:49:22.113] Guest: But I cannot go until I work out.
[01:49:22.133 - 01:49:25.358] Guest: Some days it's like I haven't worked out till 12.
[01:49:25.398 - 01:49:27.261] Guest: And Chintu says, Sir, do it.
[01:49:27.281 - 01:49:28.082] Unknown: Then you won't be able to go to editing.
[01:49:28.642 - 01:49:34.928] Guest: And then finally I was irritated and stood up and worked out so that I could go on editing.
[01:49:35.769 - 01:49:36.529] Guest: So that's how I...
[01:49:36.550 - 01:49:37.550] Guest: Motivation was editing.
[01:49:37.570 - 01:49:38.892] Guest: Yeah, motivation was editing.
[01:49:39.432 - 01:49:41.334] Guest: So that's how I worked on for Gajni.
[01:49:42.715 - 01:49:46.359] Guest: I would say that that's not a very scientific way of training.
[01:49:46.379 - 01:49:47.720] Guest: He should not do overtraining.
[01:49:47.740 - 01:49:48.901] Guest: No, it was overtraining.
[01:49:50.082 - 01:49:51.183] Guest: I have his books.
[01:49:51.203 - 01:49:58.130] Guest: I mean, in notebooks, my boy Sachin used to write how many reps
[01:49:58.338 - 01:50:01.002] Guest: which exercise, how much weight, how many reps.
[01:50:01.022 - 01:50:02.264] Guest: I have kept the whole logbook.
[01:50:04.327 - 01:50:11.978] Guest: So a few days ago, when I was looking at the logbook, there was one day when I was just doing the shoulder.
[01:50:11.998 - 01:50:13.159] Guest: 32, 34, 35 reps.
[01:50:13.941 - 01:50:14.181] Guest: Sorry.
[01:50:14.802 - 01:50:16.504] Guest: 32, 34, 35 sets.
[01:50:18.047 - 01:50:20.170] Guest: Not reps. 35 sets.
[01:50:20.971 - 01:50:21.652] Guest: Only shoulder.
[01:50:24.035 - 01:50:25.938] Host: And how many reps in one set?
[01:50:26.338 - 01:50:30.304] Guest: 8, 10, 12, 8, 10, 12 is to go 12, 10, 8, 12, 10, 8.
[01:50:30.384 - 01:50:33.969] Guest: But I used to do 32, sometimes 35 sets.
[01:50:34.751 - 01:50:35.692] Guest: Of one exercise?
[01:50:36.233 - 01:50:39.097] Guest: Of one body part, of one muscle, different exercises.
[01:50:40.740 - 01:50:41.341] Guest: That's too much.
[01:50:41.861 - 01:50:43.364] Guest: Shoulder is too small muscle.
[01:50:43.404 - 01:50:52.978] Guest: You don't need, you just need maximum 12, you know, 12, 12 solid sets is good to, you know,
[01:50:53.378 - 01:50:54.920] Guest: destroy the shoulder if you do it well.
[01:50:55.001 - 01:50:55.521] Guest: 32 cents.
[01:50:55.541 - 01:50:56.884] Guest: So there is a limit of overtraining.
[01:50:56.904 - 01:50:59.488] Guest: I used to do so much overtraining at that time.
[01:50:59.989 - 01:51:02.072] Guest: Even if you did 3-3, you would have done 10 variations.
[01:51:02.352 - 01:51:05.537] Guest: So I did a lot of overtraining in that.
[01:51:05.557 - 01:51:09.103] Guest: Then when I dungled, I had a better understanding.
[01:51:09.965 - 01:51:10.706] Guest: You were more scientific.
[01:51:10.826 - 01:51:11.747] Guest: I was more scientific.
[01:51:11.808 - 01:51:14.472] Guest: In fact, I was very scientific because I had to lose weight.
[01:51:14.692 - 01:51:20.882] Guest: And my problem was that I didn't have to lose weight in just 5 months.
[01:51:21.954 - 01:51:28.261] Guest: I wanted to look like a muscular wrestler from a fat man.
[01:51:29.042 - 01:51:32.246] Guest: So how would you look like a wrestler from a fat man?
[01:51:32.266 - 01:51:33.888] Guest: There are very few muscles in making muscles.
[01:51:33.908 - 01:51:35.750] Guest: You won't be able to make muscles in five months.
[01:51:37.031 - 01:51:39.294] Guest: So my planning started two years ago.
[01:51:39.314 - 01:51:45.441] Guest: When I had said yes, I had already started working out from Dhoom 3.
[01:51:45.461 - 01:51:46.362] Guest: So my body was good.
[01:51:47.504 - 01:51:48.164] Guest: Very well built.
[01:51:49.005 - 01:51:49.586] Guest: Less fat.
[01:51:52.290 - 01:51:54.853] Guest: So I told Mr. Nitish that we will first do the fat part.
[01:51:54.994 - 01:51:55.795] Guest: So I become fat.
[01:51:56.395 - 01:52:00.401] Guest: So when I was getting fat, I wasn't just eating fat.
[01:52:01.622 - 01:52:05.688] Guest: My training was getting very heavy.
[01:52:06.909 - 01:52:10.093] Guest: You know, I was overloading style of training.
[01:52:10.434 - 01:52:13.578] Guest: Which means I was doing first set six reps.
[01:52:14.499 - 01:52:19.666] Guest: Failing at six reps. Second set failing at four reps. And third set failing at two reps.
[01:52:20.514 - 01:52:22.176] Guest: That means I was lifting very heavy.
[01:52:22.196 - 01:52:22.857] Guest: One, two, max.
[01:52:24.199 - 01:52:26.201] Guest: After two, I cannot do third rep.
[01:52:26.221 - 01:52:27.943] Guest: Feeling and two.
[01:52:27.963 - 01:52:29.385] Guest: I was following that style.
[01:52:29.405 - 01:52:37.054] Guest: So what happened was that during that one and a half year when I was fat, when I was fat, my inner muscle was becoming very amazing.
[01:52:37.895 - 01:52:38.436] Guest: I couldn't see it.
[01:52:38.576 - 01:52:41.520] Guest: Because there was a layer of fat on it.
[01:52:41.540 - 01:52:43.322] Guest: So you thought, this is a fat man.
[01:52:43.342 - 01:52:44.984] Guest: If you take out the fat, he is a very well built man.
[01:52:45.004 - 01:52:46.706] Guest: No one was able to imagine this.
[01:52:48.098 - 01:52:51.622] Guest: So my workout was rigorous right through I was putting on beat.
[01:52:52.443 - 01:52:58.931] Guest: So the last five months in which I had to transform my body, I just had to cut my fat.
[01:52:59.131 - 01:53:00.833] Guest: Muscle was already there.
[01:53:00.853 - 01:53:05.559] Guest: Otherwise it is not possible that you do less fat in five months and also make muscle.
[01:53:05.659 - 01:53:06.861] Guest: Because you are doing opposing things.
[01:53:08.903 - 01:53:11.867] Guest: When you put on muscle in the calorie count, you will eat more.
[01:53:11.887 - 01:53:14.430] Guest: When you are cutting, you are taking less calories.
[01:53:14.450 - 01:53:16.232] Guest: You are on deficit calorie.
[01:53:16.252 - 01:53:18.034] Guest: How will I make muscle in deficit calorie?
[01:53:19.810 - 01:53:24.217] Guest: So the planning had to start much earlier for me to deliver that.
[01:53:24.998 - 01:53:26.200] Host: Did you ever take steroids?
[01:53:27.381 - 01:53:29.484] Guest: No, steroids I awarded.
[01:53:29.504 - 01:53:29.945] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:29.965 - 01:53:30.306] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:30.326 - 01:53:30.666] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:30.686 - 01:53:31.347] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:31.367 - 01:53:33.030] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:33.050 - 01:53:33.350] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:33.370 - 01:53:33.711] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:33.731 - 01:53:34.111] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:34.131 - 01:53:34.712] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:34.732 - 01:53:35.333] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:35.353 - 01:53:35.654] Unknown: I'm too scared.
[01:53:35.674 - 01:53:35.974] Unknown: I'm too scared.
[01:53:35.994 - 01:53:36.295] Unknown: I'm too scared.
[01:53:36.315 - 01:53:36.615] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:36.635 - 01:53:36.956] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:37.216 - 01:53:37.516] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:37.536 - 01:53:37.837] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:37.857 - 01:53:38.258] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:38.298 - 01:53:38.718] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:38.738 - 01:53:39.119] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:39.139 - 01:53:39.459] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:39.479 - 01:53:39.800] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:40.020 - 01:53:40.321] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:40.341 - 01:53:40.641] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:40.661 - 01:53:40.962] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:40.982 - 01:53:41.342] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:41.362 - 01:53:41.683] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:41.703 - 01:53:42.023] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:42.043 - 01:53:42.744] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:42.764 - 01:53:43.085] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:43.105 - 01:53:43.425] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:43.445 - 01:53:43.766] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:43.786 - 01:53:44.086] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:44.106 - 01:53:44.767] Host: I'm too scared.
[01:53:44.787 - 01:53:45.108] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:45.128 - 01:53:45.448] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:45.468 - 01:53:45.769] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:45.789 - 01:53:46.109] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:46.129 - 01:53:46.430] Guest: I'm too scared.
[01:53:46.470 - 01:53:46.610] Guest: I'm too
[01:53:46.850 - 01:53:51.354] Host: You were not able to, you were addicted and then for some transformation, you quit?
[01:53:51.374 - 01:53:54.117] Guest: Yeah, yeah, both the time, two-three times I have done it.
[01:53:54.137 - 01:53:57.960] Guest: It was also on this time, also on Gajni's time, also on Dangal's time.
[01:53:57.980 - 01:54:00.182] Guest: During Dangal's time, I was wrestling.
[01:54:00.443 - 01:54:11.413] Guest: So our wrestling coach, Mr. Kripashankar, told me on the first day that the wrestler who drinks cigarettes doesn't come to my mat.
[01:54:11.433 - 01:54:16.818] Guest: So I understood that if I want to learn along with Mr. Kripash,
[01:54:17.410 - 01:54:24.739] Guest: I had to quit smoking because he didn't allow a wrestler to come on his mat who was to smoke.
[01:54:25.600 - 01:54:26.421] Host: And how did you do that?
[01:54:26.481 - 01:54:28.583] Host: Many people couldn't quit smoking.
[01:54:28.603 - 01:54:29.284] Guest: Nothing.
[01:54:29.304 - 01:54:31.807] Host: If you had to do it, there was no choice.
[01:54:31.827 - 01:54:34.130] Guest: The boss said, leave it, otherwise I won't teach you.
[01:54:34.150 - 01:54:37.153] Guest: You need a guru, so you have to quit smoking.
[01:54:37.233 - 01:54:38.415] Guest: There is nothing else.
[01:54:39.095 - 01:54:41.578] Guest: So when the need arises, I am very strict.
[01:54:41.618 - 01:54:42.039] Guest: Dhoom 3.
[01:54:43.340 - 01:54:44.722] Guest: I was not smoking during Dhoom 3.
[01:54:46.114 - 01:54:49.078] Guest: Because I had to have a gymnast's body.
[01:54:49.218 - 01:54:50.460] Guest: I had to have a gymnast's body.
[01:54:52.342 - 01:54:53.524] Guest: Smoking is a very bad habit.
[01:54:53.784 - 01:54:57.469] Guest: And unfortunately, even I am forced to do that habit.
[01:54:58.671 - 01:55:00.113] Guest: So, I drink pipe right now.
[01:55:01.134 - 01:55:02.937] Guest: But I am not happy with it.
[01:55:02.957 - 01:55:08.224] Guest: And I tell everyone that this is one thing that you shouldn't do.
[01:55:08.244 - 01:55:08.424] Guest: Alcohol.
[01:55:09.706 - 01:55:11.028] Guest: And cigarette or pipe.
[01:55:11.849 - 01:55:12.209] Guest: Smoking.
[01:55:13.030 - 01:55:15.794] Guest: These are two things that a person should never try.
[01:55:16.322 - 01:55:17.463] Host: I haven't.
[01:55:17.483 - 01:55:18.565] Guest: You are doing very well.
[01:55:18.585 - 01:55:20.447] Host: But the trend has become young people now.
[01:55:21.088 - 01:55:23.671] Host: They are not actually choosing alcohol.
[01:55:23.771 - 01:55:25.613] Guest: Yeah, that's a very good thing actually.
[01:55:25.633 - 01:55:31.480] Guest: The growing audience, the younger generation is very smart and smart.
[01:55:31.500 - 01:55:35.044] Guest: We didn't have so much knowledge at that time.
[01:55:35.405 - 01:55:36.526] Guest: We didn't have internet.
[01:55:36.546 - 01:55:38.148] Guest: Today you understand so many things about health.
[01:55:38.168 - 01:55:40.050] Guest: There are so many conversations about health.
[01:55:40.230 - 01:55:42.874] Guest: We didn't have all this at that time.
[01:55:42.894 - 01:55:43.314] Guest: We made mistakes.
[01:55:43.906 - 01:55:49.854] Guest: If I knew all this, I wouldn't have been on that path.
[01:55:49.874 - 01:55:51.877] Guest: You know, it's a bad habit of smoking.
[01:55:52.037 - 01:55:53.339] Host: And there are two reasons.
[01:55:53.359 - 01:55:55.763] Host: One is that the conversation of health is increasing.
[01:55:55.783 - 01:56:03.634] Host: Second is that the wellness that is involved in it is considered as higher status.
[01:56:03.654 - 01:56:07.379] Host: Yes, it has a lot of respect.
[01:56:07.399 - 01:56:12.306] Host: It's like when you go to a run club or whatever sport you play, that active lifestyle
[01:56:12.482 - 01:56:13.303] Guest: is appreciated.
[01:56:13.984 - 01:56:17.188] Host: So that's why more and more people are getting away, going away from alcohol.
[01:56:17.208 - 01:56:17.789] Guest: That's a good thing.
[01:56:18.269 - 01:56:19.451] Host: That's a brilliant change.
[01:56:19.511 - 01:56:20.151] Host: Brilliant change.
[01:56:20.352 - 01:56:22.755] Host: Earlier, the one who didn't drink, I faced this.
[01:56:22.775 - 01:56:27.721] Host: I used to see in the group, you don't have fun, how boring a person is.
[01:56:27.741 - 01:56:28.942] Host: Now it's appreciated.
[01:56:29.543 - 01:56:31.225] Host: How do you do it even when I want to?
[01:56:31.265 - 01:56:32.927] Host: I wish I could do it.
[01:56:32.947 - 01:56:33.648] Guest: So that's changing.
[01:56:33.748 - 01:56:34.189] Guest: It's changing.
[01:56:34.549 - 01:56:38.354] Host: It happens in the mind that I am adapting.
[01:56:38.754 - 01:56:41.717] Host: So maybe he is copying someone else's work or not.
[01:56:41.798 - 01:56:43.119] Host: What goes on in your head?
[01:56:43.179 - 01:56:45.862] Host: Original work versus adaptation or remake?
[01:56:46.503 - 01:56:48.125] Guest: I don't have any problem in remaking.
[01:56:48.205 - 01:56:51.128] Guest: I don't think my creativity is decreasing at all.
[01:56:51.168 - 01:56:53.952] Guest: Because I am doing a new job for myself.
[01:56:53.972 - 01:56:56.334] Guest: Someone else has made this story.
[01:56:56.354 - 01:56:58.437] Guest: Now I am giving it my own vision.
[01:56:58.457 - 01:57:02.301] Guest: And this team is giving it their own vision.
[01:57:02.321 - 01:57:03.743] Guest: And we are blowing our energy into it.
[01:57:03.763 - 01:57:06.546] Guest: We are putting our lives into it.
[01:57:07.490 - 01:57:10.654] Guest: He is totally unrelated to the team who did that.
[01:57:13.457 - 01:57:16.381] Guest: Shakespeare people do it till today.
[01:57:16.401 - 01:57:20.305] Guest: Till today, in theatre, number one playwright is Shakespeare, the world.
[01:57:21.347 - 01:57:25.892] Guest: And till today, in every language, they do Shakespeare.
[01:57:25.912 - 01:57:28.415] Guest: And for that, we are doing Vahak.
[01:57:28.535 - 01:57:30.057] Guest: Vah, Shakespeare is doing it.
[01:57:30.438 - 01:57:30.738] Guest: Why?
[01:57:30.798 - 01:57:31.999] Guest: It is a remake, stop it.
[01:57:32.020 - 01:57:32.380] Host: Adaptation.
[01:57:32.400 - 01:57:33.041] Guest: You write your own drama.
[01:57:33.061 - 01:57:34.482] Guest: Why are you doing Shakespeare till today?
[01:57:34.503 - 01:57:37.426] Guest: It has been 400 years, you are still doing Shakespeare.
[01:57:38.850 - 01:57:40.733] Guest: When we play Shakespeare, we praise each other.
[01:57:40.753 - 01:57:41.814] Guest: This is what Shakespeare is doing.
[01:57:41.834 - 01:57:44.137] Guest: That is also a remake, right?
[01:57:44.158 - 01:57:46.381] Guest: The story is written by someone else.
[01:57:46.401 - 01:57:48.404] Guest: Thousands of people have been told.
[01:57:48.424 - 01:57:50.527] Guest: Now you will do it again.
[01:57:50.547 - 01:57:51.448] Guest: You will repeat it.
[01:57:51.468 - 01:57:53.250] Guest: This is wrong thinking.
[01:57:53.270 - 01:57:57.516] Guest: I am doing Shakespeare again.
[01:57:57.977 - 01:58:02.043] Guest: I am putting it in my own life.
[01:58:02.063 - 01:58:04.466] Guest: So the discussion of remakes, I find it very futile.
[01:58:05.688 - 01:58:07.090] Guest: And I don't believe in it.
[01:58:07.394 - 01:58:11.459] Guest: When I am doing Gajini, I have made Murugutas in Tamil.
[01:58:11.479 - 01:58:12.981] Guest: Now you are doing Gajini again.
[01:58:14.963 - 01:58:16.505] Guest: No, but I am doing it with my own eyes.
[01:58:16.525 - 01:58:22.393] Guest: And for my audience, I am showing you my own energy.
[01:58:22.413 - 01:58:26.077] Guest: So I think my work is different from that.
[01:58:26.097 - 01:58:27.539] Guest: Whatever he has made is good.
[01:58:27.559 - 01:58:28.921] Guest: I am not saying that it is not good.
[01:58:28.941 - 01:58:32.946] Guest: But whatever we have made comes in a different quality.
[01:58:33.826 - 01:58:35.950] Guest: If there is such a problem in the remakes, then stop Shakespeare.
[01:58:35.970 - 01:58:37.332] Guest: First of all, Shakespeare is the oldest remake.
[01:58:37.973 - 01:58:58.290] Guest: The number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far, the number of people you are doing so far
[01:58:58.498 - 01:59:02.542] Guest: And if I take a Spanish film as a remake, then why are the Spanish people doing something wrong?
[01:59:04.364 - 01:59:05.065] Guest: I like this.
[01:59:05.085 - 01:59:07.648] Guest: Your blood is blood and our blood is water.
[01:59:07.668 - 01:59:08.489] Guest: Do you understand what I mean?
[01:59:08.509 - 01:59:09.750] Guest: I like the perspective.
[01:59:09.770 - 01:59:11.693] Guest: It's all nonsense.
[01:59:11.713 - 01:59:13.074] Guest: I go to watch a film.
[01:59:13.094 - 01:59:17.399] Guest: If you tell me that this film was made by Ashok Kumar 25 years ago, then I say, okay, very good.
[01:59:17.519 - 01:59:20.282] Guest: But what I am seeing at this time is this.
[01:59:20.302 - 01:59:23.666] Guest: So I have no problem being a creative person.
[01:59:23.686 - 01:59:27.570] Guest: I don't have any problem that I have done this 10 times before.
[01:59:28.034 - 01:59:29.296] Guest: I will learn from them.
[01:59:29.316 - 01:59:36.645] Guest: I will learn from 10 people and I will try to put my own things in it.
[01:59:36.685 - 01:59:39.589] Guest: So it was not difficult for me to make a remake.
[01:59:39.649 - 01:59:46.798] Guest: After Lalsing, many people told me that you are making a remake again.
[01:59:46.818 - 01:59:50.162] Guest: Lalsing had a lot of trolling that you made a remake.
[01:59:53.282 - 01:59:54.864] Guest: But I'm a little crazy guy.
[01:59:54.884 - 01:59:57.648] Guest: I don't even understand practical things.
[01:59:57.708 - 02:00:05.799] Guest: So the story that I told you about when I saw the Spanish film, I can tell you about such a beautiful film.
[02:00:07.521 - 02:00:09.804] Guest: The film I saw, I thought I was watching Tariz Amibar's Part 2.
[02:00:09.824 - 02:00:15.411] Guest: When I saw the film, I thought this is Tariz Amibar's 10th step forward.
[02:00:15.752 - 02:00:17.614] Guest: So it wasn't a champion for me.
[02:00:17.995 - 02:00:20.498] Guest: It was Tariz Amibar's Part 2 for me.
[02:00:20.994 - 02:00:30.084] Guest: I am saying a big thing in the same space which is very important for us to understand the people of India.
[02:00:30.104 - 02:00:32.767] Guest: Now, what will the people of India see in Spanish films?
[02:00:32.787 - 02:00:35.551] Guest: We don't eat Indian food.
[02:00:35.571 - 02:00:37.633] Guest: Have you ever eaten continental food?
[02:00:38.234 - 02:00:39.615] Guest: It is very difficult for me to talk.
[02:00:39.635 - 02:00:40.736] Guest: But Indians need it.
[02:00:40.757 - 02:00:42.599] Guest: You need Indians, brother.
[02:00:42.619 - 02:00:43.500] Guest: You need lentil rice.
[02:00:43.740 - 02:00:46.183] Guest: If you eat outside for two days, then you don't need it for three days.
[02:00:46.203 - 02:00:49.106] Guest: So how many people will see Spanish films in India?
[02:00:49.602 - 02:00:54.308] Guest: And they will enjoy it, or they will get a chance to learn something from it.
[02:00:54.328 - 02:00:58.114] Guest: They don't even get to see it.
[02:00:58.174 - 02:01:01.158] Guest: So I don't have any problem with all these things.
[02:01:01.178 - 02:01:09.129] Guest: And when practical advice was given to me that if you are making a remake, I said, yes, this story has entered me.
[02:01:09.149 - 02:01:11.993] Guest: Until I make it, it won't come out.
[02:01:12.013 - 02:01:12.914] Guest: Till then I can't do anything else.
[02:01:14.242 - 02:01:16.065] Guest: I don't think it's a remake of what other people have.
[02:01:16.085 - 02:01:17.507] Guest: I enjoy doing a remake.
[02:01:17.527 - 02:01:21.153] Guest: I am telling you the same thing in a different way.
[02:01:22.254 - 02:01:23.676] Guest: And maybe I should make it weaker than that.
[02:01:23.696 - 02:01:24.958] Guest: Maybe I should make it better.
[02:01:24.978 - 02:01:26.180] Guest: That's a different thing.
[02:01:26.200 - 02:01:27.262] Guest: But it's fun to make me.
[02:01:27.362 - 02:01:32.350] Guest: As a creative person, it doesn't matter to me that a thousand people have done this before.
[02:01:32.370 - 02:01:36.055] Guest: So what happened?
[02:01:36.075 - 02:01:37.758] Guest: Isn't it good that I am learning from my ancestors?
[02:01:37.778 - 02:01:41.363] Host: That's why I have made a mistake.
[02:01:41.383 - 02:01:43.186] Host: And where is the release on the Star of the Earth?
[02:01:43.458 - 02:01:49.367] Guest: The movie is being released in theatres, only theatres, not anywhere else.
[02:01:49.387 - 02:01:51.169] Host: So what is this YouTube?
[02:01:51.189 - 02:01:51.950] Host: As a rumor, right?
[02:01:51.970 - 02:01:52.411] Host: You saw?
[02:01:52.672 - 02:01:53.493] Guest: Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:53.513 - 02:01:55.476] Guest: I have read a lot on YouTube.
[02:01:55.596 - 02:01:57.338] Guest: I have read a lot of different theories.
[02:01:58.520 - 02:02:02.486] Guest: But... Paper view.
[02:02:02.506 - 02:02:07.433] Guest: I have received different proposals to release the movie.
[02:02:07.453 - 02:02:10.738] Guest: But I am keeping everyone aside.
[02:02:11.618 - 02:02:15.123] Guest: And I am only paying attention to one thing, theatrical.
[02:02:16.265 - 02:02:21.653] Guest: Because I think that theatrical business, at this time, we have taken steps as an industry.
[02:02:21.693 - 02:02:23.595] Guest: I will not blame anyone else.
[02:02:23.616 - 02:02:24.216] Guest: I will blame myself.
[02:02:25.018 - 02:02:39.058] Guest: The film industry has taken such steps in the last 15-20 years that we have calculated a lot and thought that whatever we do, our business will get worse.
[02:02:39.170 - 02:02:49.741] Guest: We have thought about it and made such policies with which our business is getting less and less and less.
[02:02:49.761 - 02:02:57.789] Guest: And now that we come to OTT in 4 weeks or 6 weeks, then the business is completely over.
[02:02:57.809 - 02:03:05.837] Guest: Because I am telling you that this is a mug, you take 10 rupees and if you don't take it then you leave it at home after 8 weeks.
[02:03:05.857 - 02:03:07.218] Guest: So why will you take 10 rupees mug?
[02:03:08.354 - 02:03:11.877] Guest: So this is a very wrong understanding of mine.
[02:03:11.897 - 02:03:17.623] Guest: I am not a business man, but my common sense tells me that how can I sell you twice in one thing?
[02:03:19.485 - 02:03:19.965] Guest: I don't know.
[02:03:20.466 - 02:03:22.548] Guest: You can do it if you know.
[02:03:22.568 - 02:03:22.968] Guest: I don't know.
[02:03:24.430 - 02:03:29.955] Guest: So there was a time when OTT came after six months.
[02:03:29.975 - 02:03:32.377] Guest: Now it's coming after a few weeks.
[02:03:32.417 - 02:03:34.479] Guest: So I don't have that suit.
[02:03:34.499 - 02:03:36.261] Guest: I don't have any problem with OTT.
[02:03:36.421 - 02:03:37.362] Guest: OTT is doing a good job.
[02:03:37.698 - 02:03:40.702] Guest: If I make it for OTT content, it will come directly to OTT.
[02:03:40.862 - 02:03:41.283] Guest: I don't mind.
[02:03:41.723 - 02:03:43.045] Guest: As a viewer, I also like OTT.
[02:03:43.065 - 02:03:45.088] Guest: Because we get to see a lot of content.
[02:03:45.148 - 02:03:46.149] Guest: I don't feel any problem with OTT.
[02:03:46.169 - 02:03:47.651] Guest: I have this problem in the system.
[02:03:47.672 - 02:03:52.258] Guest: You are coming to the theatre, then after a few weeks, you come to OTT.
[02:03:52.278 - 02:03:53.580] Guest: I don't understand that.
[02:03:53.600 - 02:03:58.486] Guest: So I am very clear that my film that will come will only come in the theatre.
[02:03:58.506 - 02:04:07.218] Guest: The theatre... A lot of people think that the theatre will not be there after 10 years.
[02:04:07.554 - 02:04:12.621] Guest: Some people have given great statements about it.
[02:04:12.641 - 02:04:20.834] Guest: I am a filmmaker and I may be a fool, I may be talking nonsense.
[02:04:20.854 - 02:04:21.875] Guest: But that is my belief.
[02:04:23.277 - 02:04:26.001] Guest: My belief is in cinema and theater.
[02:04:26.021 - 02:04:27.964] Guest: So I will do that.
[02:04:28.305 - 02:04:32.050] Guest: Although I have a lot of offers for different platforms.
[02:04:32.090 - 02:04:34.353] Guest: I have not told everyone respectfully.
[02:04:34.494 - 02:04:35.135] Guest: I said no.
[02:04:35.155 - 02:04:37.458] Guest: I will only come to the theater.
[02:04:38.242 - 02:04:42.647] Guest: And when the business of theater will be over, then we will think ahead of what to do.
[02:04:43.809 - 02:04:44.430] Guest: Only theater.
[02:04:46.412 - 02:04:52.580] Host: But like Laapata Ladies, it is better to go to OTT.
[02:04:53.160 - 02:04:55.663] Host: No, I don't think so.
[02:04:55.804 - 02:04:58.947] Host: On OTT, then it is not so good to go to OTT.
[02:04:59.008 - 02:04:59.788] Guest: My thinking is wrong.
[02:05:00.790 - 02:05:07.538] Guest: Look, when Laapata Ladies was released, first comes the end of Netflix.
[02:05:07.778 - 02:05:13.445] Guest: So everyone knows that after seeing your poster, your trailer, your film, your film Netflix, it will be released a few weeks later.
[02:05:13.465 - 02:05:16.889] Guest: Now let me tell you what is the effect of that.
[02:05:17.870 - 02:05:29.985] Guest: I don't know if there is any Salman Shah Rukh Khan in Ladies, there is no such big song, there is no action, there is no stunt, there is no such thing.
[02:05:30.005 - 02:05:31.186] Guest: Now when will I go to watch this film?
[02:05:33.314 - 02:05:37.340] Guest: I will only go when his word of mouth will be very strong.
[02:05:37.360 - 02:05:41.928] Guest: There is no star in it, there is nothing obvious because of which I go.
[02:05:41.948 - 02:05:46.836] Guest: But I have heard from 10 people that it is a wonderful film.
[02:05:46.856 - 02:05:48.118] Guest: You should watch it, you should watch it.
[02:05:50.061 - 02:05:54.548] Guest: But because I know that it will come to my house a few weeks later.
[02:05:54.568 - 02:05:55.890] Guest: So I will listen to any praise.
[02:05:56.802 - 02:06:23.954] Guest: No matter how much I listen to the praise, I will say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[02:06:24.290 - 02:06:25.932] Guest: So the business of that today's date is 18-20 crore.
[02:06:25.952 - 02:06:26.613] Guest: That goes above 100 crore.
[02:06:26.633 - 02:06:27.094] Guest: That's the difference.
[02:06:27.114 - 02:06:33.642] Guest: So on Satara's land, you are saying that at least right now there is no conversation that it will be on YouTube or Netflix or Amazon.
[02:06:33.662 - 02:06:34.183] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:34.203 - 02:06:34.743] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:34.763 - 02:06:35.284] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:35.304 - 02:06:35.965] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:35.985 - 02:06:36.486] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:36.506 - 02:06:37.347] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:37.387 - 02:06:38.048] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:38.068 - 02:06:38.568] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:38.628 - 02:06:39.169] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:39.189 - 02:06:39.710] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:39.730 - 02:06:40.431] Host: There is no conversation.
[02:06:40.451 - 02:06:40.971] Guest: There is no conversation.
[02:06:40.991 - 02:06:41.492] Guest: There is no conversation.
[02:06:41.512 - 02:06:42.013] Guest: There is no conversation.
[02:06:42.033 - 02:06:42.533] Guest: There is no conversation.

[02:06:52.146 - 02:06:52.306] Guest: There is
[02:06:52.386 - 02:06:53.608] Guest: This is my first interview actually.
[02:06:53.628 - 02:06:56.772] Guest: So through you people will know that only theater is coming.
[02:06:56.792 - 02:06:59.436] Guest: On 20th June it is not coming anywhere.
[02:06:59.456 - 02:07:02.059] Guest: So you can only see it in theater.
[02:07:02.079 - 02:07:04.583] Host: Definitely not anywhere.
[02:07:05.824 - 02:07:07.286] Host: I have last two questions for you.
[02:07:07.887 - 02:07:14.476] Host: If Aamir Khan is making his last movie, what do you want it to be about?
[02:07:20.124 - 02:07:21.906] Guest: See, this is my dream.
[02:07:21.986 - 02:07:25.030] Guest: My dream is to make Mahawarudh.
[02:07:26.913 - 02:07:29.797] Guest: And I am working on it after its release.
[02:07:29.817 - 02:07:30.899] Guest: After 20th June.
[02:07:31.600 - 02:07:34.244] Guest: I am working on it.
[02:07:34.264 - 02:07:38.069] Guest: So I think that is a work.
[02:07:38.089 - 02:07:38.910] Guest: That is a project.
[02:07:40.292 - 02:07:47.483] Guest: After doing that, I might have that feeling that I might not be able to do anything after this.
[02:07:47.503 - 02:07:49.746] Guest: Because it is materialized.
[02:07:49.954 - 02:07:58.307] Guest: Grand, complicated, layered, emotion, scale, everything.
[02:07:58.407 - 02:08:02.253] Guest: Everything in the world you will find in Mahabharat.
[02:08:02.673 - 02:08:06.239] Guest: So when you ask me what could be your last?
[02:08:06.559 - 02:08:08.382] Guest: I hope that I dive with my shoes on.
[02:08:08.422 - 02:08:17.336] Guest: The one uncle used to say that I want to die while working.
[02:08:17.356 - 02:08:18.898] Guest: So he wants all of us.
[02:08:19.490 - 02:08:30.705] Guest: But since you are asking, I have only one thing that I can think that if after doing this, maybe I have that emotion inside me, that now I don't have to do anything after this.
[02:08:30.725 - 02:08:30.845] Guest: Maybe.
[02:08:31.286 - 02:08:32.788] Host: I don't know.
[02:08:32.808 - 02:08:33.749] Host: Nice.
[02:08:33.769 - 02:08:37.214] Host: Mahabharat would be an exciting project.
[02:08:37.234 - 02:08:43.542] Host: Right now, I am actually excited for Sitaar-e-Zameen because Sitaar-e-Zameen had an impact in my family.
[02:08:43.562 - 02:08:43.903] Guest: Okay.
[02:08:44.123 - 02:08:46.546] Host: So that's why I am
[02:08:47.490 - 02:08:49.853] Host: Actually, I'm closely following that.
[02:08:49.874 - 02:08:52.938] Host: Even in cool culture, it became a style.
[02:08:52.958 - 02:08:53.799] Host: That was competition.
[02:08:53.819 - 02:09:03.754] Host: But I think first time I saw my parents crying in a movie or in my home, there was a vulnerable talk.
[02:09:04.255 - 02:09:10.223] Host: So that's why when you say that the next sequel is 10 steps ahead, I'm excited and I'm genuinely excited.
[02:09:10.244 - 02:09:10.344] Guest: Yeah.
[02:09:11.746 - 02:09:13.448] Guest: No, it's a film which really...
[02:09:15.832 - 02:09:17.394] Guest: This film makes you happy.
[02:09:18.626 - 02:09:19.928] Guest: Let's, I'm waiting.
[02:09:19.948 - 02:09:20.449] Guest: I have a feeling.
[02:09:20.469 - 02:09:24.294] Guest: When you watch a film, you feel so happy.
[02:09:24.314 - 02:09:25.576] Guest: It fills you with joy.
[02:09:25.596 - 02:09:30.483] Guest: In Tarizemi, we have made everyone happy.
[02:09:30.503 - 02:09:32.085] Guest: We will laugh in this.
[02:09:32.125 - 02:09:34.809] Guest: We will touch, we will laugh.
[02:09:34.829 - 02:09:42.340] Guest: And one very important thing we want to share with our audience.
[02:09:42.620 - 02:09:43.922] Host: Here is the last question.
[02:09:44.770 - 02:09:46.893] Host: How can I do this better?
[02:09:47.133 - 02:09:48.555] Host: What advice can you give me?
[02:09:48.655 - 02:09:50.999] Host: Based on you spent 4-5 hours with me now.
[02:09:52.020 - 02:09:52.621] Host: Oh!
[02:09:53.101 - 02:09:56.386] Host: What should I do better so that I become better in my work?
[02:09:57.267 - 02:10:00.432] Guest: You meet your guests first before interviewing.
[02:10:00.472 - 02:10:02.194] Guest: Is this a conscious decision?
[02:10:02.214 - 02:10:02.575] Guest: Yes.
[02:10:03.436 - 02:10:05.398] Guest: Okay.
[02:10:05.418 - 02:10:08.843] Guest: So what I have observed, we have been talking for 3-4 hours.
[02:10:08.863 - 02:10:13.810] Guest: What I have observed, you are very
[02:10:14.274 - 02:10:20.142] Guest: You are free flowing and you naturally follow the conversation.
[02:10:20.162 - 02:10:31.857] Guest: Maybe you have some questions in your mind about the guest, but you leave it for a second and you follow the conversation and you instinctively follow it.
[02:10:31.877 - 02:10:39.186] Guest: An organic, natural flow of the conversation that you do, which is of great quality.
[02:10:39.426 - 02:10:41.448] Guest: There are very few people who have that quality.
[02:10:41.468 - 02:10:45.492] Guest: People first decide their questions and sometimes they also decide the answer, that this should be the answer.
[02:10:45.752 - 02:10:50.397] Guest: So when you don't give the answer, they ask the same question in 3-4 ways until they get the answer.
[02:10:52.358 - 02:10:56.002] Guest: You don't do this.
[02:10:56.022 - 02:10:57.824] Guest: You give a lie and you want to listen.
[02:10:57.844 - 02:11:01.587] Guest: Many people who interview don't listen to the answer.
[02:11:01.607 - 02:11:05.811] Guest: They just ask questions and then they don't know where they go.
[02:11:05.832 - 02:11:08.434] Guest: They don't listen to the answer.
[02:11:09.026 - 02:11:14.354] Guest: You listen to the answer carefully and you take it forward.
[02:11:14.675 - 02:11:16.758] Guest: The qualities that I have seen in you are all the right qualities.
[02:11:16.798 - 02:11:29.197] Guest: There is one thing that I can suggest to you and I am not even sure about that.
[02:11:29.337 - 02:11:32.502] Guest: For example, I asked you, we are meeting for the first time.
[02:11:32.522 - 02:11:35.186] Guest: We have not given any time together.
[02:11:36.642 - 02:11:45.314] Guest: So sometimes there are advantages or advantages or advantages that you don't know about the person you are going to talk to or you haven't met or you are talking to for the first time.
[02:11:45.795 - 02:11:48.719] Guest: There is an advantage in that.
[02:11:48.739 - 02:11:52.864] Guest: But sometimes there is an advantage on the other side too.
[02:11:52.884 - 02:12:00.334] Guest: That you don't ask about interviews but once you meet the person then you at least understand what this person actually is.
[02:12:01.536 - 02:12:05.842] Guest: So when you actually come in front of the mic then you have more
[02:12:07.010 - 02:12:10.996] Guest: material, substance, to ask that person about those things.
[02:12:11.016 - 02:12:14.741] Guest: Because you have understood that person a little bit.
[02:12:14.762 - 02:12:22.012] Guest: So that's the only thing I can suggest, which is also not hard and fast because sometimes you'll want to know the guest, sometimes you'd rather not know the guest.
[02:12:22.934 - 02:12:25.477] Guest: But otherwise I think you're doing really well.
[02:12:25.497 - 02:12:25.998] Host: Thank you.
[02:12:26.018 - 02:12:26.819] Guest: We're doing really well.
[02:12:27.420 - 02:12:32.308] Guest: Actually, the conversation I've done, I don't know when this kind of conversation happened.
[02:12:32.328 - 02:12:33.970] Guest: I don't remember.
[02:12:34.082 - 02:12:34.903] Host: Thank you so much.
[02:12:34.923 - 02:12:38.247] Guest: Yeah, I really enjoyed the conversation because you naturally flow.
[02:12:39.168 - 02:12:39.328] Guest: Wow.
[02:12:39.388 - 02:12:40.809] Guest: And you listen.
[02:12:41.811 - 02:12:46.536] Guest: Actually, our conversation is not just an interview or question answer.
[02:12:46.636 - 02:12:49.259] Guest: Actually, our conversation is happening.
[02:12:49.579 - 02:12:52.302] Guest: So, those qualities can bring very few people.
[02:12:52.322 - 02:12:52.743] Host: Thank you.
[02:12:52.863 - 02:12:55.286] Guest: And naturally, they come within you.
[02:12:57.268 - 02:12:58.649] Guest: Or maybe you have thought about it.
[02:12:58.890 - 02:13:00.932] Guest: You have been doing it for four years now.
[02:13:00.952 - 02:13:02.834] Guest: You also reached a level of maturity.
[02:13:04.066 - 02:13:05.528] Guest: But I found you really good.
[02:13:06.088 - 02:13:06.569] Host: Thank you.
[02:13:06.669 - 02:13:08.692] Host: It means a lot that it's coming from you.
[02:13:09.353 - 02:13:12.717] Host: And now going forward, I'll do experiment 2-3 times.
[02:13:13.377 - 02:13:13.898] Host: Try that.
[02:13:14.078 - 02:13:20.747] Host: Because when we took a break and we talked about 2-3 times, our bond was stronger.
[02:13:20.767 - 02:13:26.834] Host: Like I could, because the candidate we talked about, I was more free.
[02:13:26.914 - 02:13:30.019] Host: So maybe there's an advantage to it, but I don't get it consciously.
[02:13:30.199 - 02:13:33.845] Host: Because I'm very curious as a person, I don't want to... You want that curiosity to remain.
[02:13:33.945 - 02:13:34.646] Guest: I understand.
[02:13:34.686 - 02:13:36.429] Guest: There's a quality in that.
[02:13:36.449 - 02:13:38.472] Guest: But I'm saying meet the person only this much.
[02:13:39.874 - 02:13:41.476] Guest: To give you some understanding.
[02:13:41.556 - 02:13:43.600] Guest: Your curiosity should not be satiated.
[02:13:44.341 - 02:13:44.741] Host: I'll try.
[02:13:44.801 - 02:13:46.264] Guest: There's an experiment to be done.
[02:13:46.624 - 02:13:47.445] Guest: Let's see what works.
[02:13:47.465 - 02:13:48.567] Guest: There's a long way to go.
[02:13:48.627 - 02:13:55.698] Guest: When I used to do interviews in Satyamajai, I used to call people and talk to them.
[02:13:56.386 - 02:13:57.828] Guest: I would meet them one day earlier.
[02:13:59.590 - 02:14:02.494] Guest: Because it was very important for me to be connected with them.
[02:14:02.574 - 02:14:04.998] Guest: So we would meet at lunch.
[02:14:05.038 - 02:14:08.162] Guest: If there were 10 guests on my show, they would sit with me at lunch.
[02:14:08.182 - 02:14:11.547] Guest: And we would meet each other for the first time.
[02:14:11.567 - 02:14:18.897] Guest: But in the beginning, I would tell them that the topic of the show is not discussed at lunch.
[02:14:18.917 - 02:14:20.639] Guest: We will not discuss at all about the topic.
[02:14:20.659 - 02:14:23.603] Guest: I just want to know more about you.
[02:14:23.623 - 02:14:25.586] Guest: And you
[02:14:25.698 - 02:14:28.542] Guest: I want to know more about myself.
[02:14:28.562 - 02:14:30.665] Guest: We will discuss the topic tomorrow.
[02:14:30.685 - 02:14:32.888] Guest: We will open that today.
[02:14:34.270 - 02:14:38.355] Guest: But what happens is that you form a certain connect with the person.
[02:14:39.176 - 02:14:43.262] Guest: But you have to be strict not to ask those questions on the first day.
[02:14:43.282 - 02:14:43.923] Guest: Then it repeats.
[02:14:43.983 - 02:14:44.864] Guest: Then it gets fun.
[02:14:44.884 - 02:14:47.768] Guest: You asked the same question yesterday and today.
[02:14:47.788 - 02:14:49.130] Guest: It doesn't get fun.
[02:14:49.150 - 02:14:52.254] Host: So the next time we will do it... Just eat a little.
[02:14:52.274 - 02:14:55.058] Guest: Don't go to the topic.
[02:14:55.202 - 02:14:55.683] Host: I'll do.
[02:14:55.703 - 02:14:56.244] Guest: That's what I would.
[02:14:56.665 - 02:14:57.145] Guest: I'll experiment.
[02:14:57.165 - 02:14:58.047] Guest: One idea.
[02:14:58.488 - 02:15:04.117] Guest: Next time when we... Because you are asking, you are doing so well that you don't need advice.
[02:15:04.137 - 02:15:10.388] Host: I feel good when someone whom I respect a lot takes advice from them because there's always something to do.
[02:15:10.408 - 02:15:11.129] Guest: No, I agree with you.
[02:15:11.229 - 02:15:13.634] Guest: I also keep asking people what they feel about my work.
[02:15:14.635 - 02:15:20.946] Guest: Because you get to learn from an honest or candid answer that I didn't think so.
[02:15:21.442 - 02:15:23.687] Host: Yes, what you said, I'm experimenting.
[02:15:23.787 - 02:15:24.749] Host: Thank you so much, sir.
[02:15:24.989 - 02:15:27.053] Guest: It's a pleasure having you.
[02:15:27.094 - 02:15:28.316] Unknown: It's a lovely meeting.
[02:15:28.777 - 02:15:29.118] Host: Pleasure.
[02:15:29.398 - 02:15:29.819] Unknown: Thank you.
[02:15:29.899 - 02:15:31.222] Unknown: Take care.
[02:15:31.242 - 02:15:32.184] Unknown: Hello, sir.
[02:15:32.204 - 02:15:32.785] Unknown: Pleasure meeting.
[02:15:32.825 - 02:15:33.667] Unknown: Pleasure pleasure.
[02:15:33.687 - 02:15:34.509] Unknown: Sorry I got late here.
[02:15:34.529 - 02:15:36.332] Unknown: It's completely alright, please.
[02:15:36.352 - 02:15:38.938] Unknown: Will you go that way?
[02:15:38.958 - 02:15:39.218] Unknown: Yes.
[02:15:39.238 - 02:15:39.960] Unknown: Thank you so much.
[02:15:40.020 - 02:15:41.042] Unknown: Thank you.
[02:15:43.234 - 02:15:45.760] Host: Because right now I'm noticing.
[02:15:45.840 - 02:15:48.185] Host: I thought it was a good pause because I want to...
[02:15:49.288 - 02:15:52.976] Host: I mean the last one you left, I usually don't have a prepared set.
[02:15:53.938 - 02:15:56.985] Host: So the one you're leaving, you're continuing ahead.
[02:15:57.106 - 02:15:57.266] Host: Correct.
[02:15:57.474 - 02:16:01.479] Host: So now you have left one thing and continue with it, but it's not complete.
[02:16:01.819 - 02:16:02.300] Guest: Okay, shit.
[02:16:02.320 - 02:16:02.941] Guest: Shit.
[02:16:02.961 - 02:16:03.281] Unknown: Shut up.
[02:16:03.461 - 02:16:06.405] Guest: No, what happens is that my mind goes very fast.
[02:16:06.425 - 02:16:11.632] Guest: Sometimes when I want to speak, the speed of my speaking and the speed of my mind are very different.
